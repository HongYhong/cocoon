32523078        	Establishment of 2.5D organoid culture model using 3D bladder cancer organoid culture.            	Three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture holds great promises in cancer precision medicine. However, Matrigel and stem cell-stimulating supplements are necessary for culturing 3D organoid cells. It costs a lot of money and consumes more time and effort compared with 2D cultured cells. Therefore, the establishment of cheaper and Matrigel-free organoid culture that can maintain the characteristics of a part of 3D organoids is demanded. In the previous study, we established a dog bladder cancer (BC) 3D organoid culture system by using their urine samples. Here, we successfully isolated cells named "2.5D organoid" from multiple strains of dog BC 3D organoids using 2.5 organoid media. The cell proliferation speed of 2.5D organoids was faster than parental 3D organoid cells. The expression pattern of stem cell markers was close to 3D organoids. Injection of 2.5D organoid cells into immunodeficient mice formed tumors and showed the histopathological characteristics of urothelial carcinoma similar to the injection of dog BC 3D organoids. The 2.5D organoids had a similar sensitivity profile for anti-cancer drug treatment to their parental 3D organoids. These data suggest that our established 2.5D organoid culture method might become a reasonable and useful tool instead of 3D organoids in dog BC research and therapy.	
32066753        	Modelling of pancreatic cancer biology: transcriptomic signature for 3D PDX-derived organoids and primary cell line organoid development.            	With a five-year survival rate of 9%, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest of all cancers. The rapid mortality makes PDAC difficult to research, and inspires a resolve to create reliable, tractable cellular models for preclinical cancer research. Organoids are increasingly used to model PDAC as they maintain the differentiation status, molecular and genomic signatures of the original tumour. In this paper, we present novel methodologies and experimental approaches to develop PDAC organoids from PDX tumours, and the simultaneous development of matched primary cell lines. Moreover, we also present a method of recapitulating primary cell line cultures to organoids (CLOs). We highlight the usefulness of CLOs as PDAC organoid models, as they maintain similar transcriptomic signatures as their matched patient-derived organoids and patient derived xenografts (PDX)s. These models provide a manageable, expandable in vitro resource for downstream applications such as high throughput screening, functional genomics, and tumour microenvironment studies.	
31254429        	Establishment of a novel experimental model for muscle-invasive bladder cancer using a dog bladder cancer organoid culture.            	In human and dogs, bladder cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm affecting the urinary tract. Dog BC resembles human muscle-invasive BC in histopathological characteristics and gene expression profiles, and could be an important research model for this disease. Cancer patient-derived organoid culture can recapitulate organ structures and maintains the gene expression profiles of original tumor tissues. In a previous study, we generated dog prostate cancer organoids using urine samples, however dog BC organoids had never been produced. Therefore we aimed to generate dog BC organoids using urine samples and check their histopathological characteristics, drug sensitivity, and gene expression profiles. Organoids from individual BC dogs were successfully generated, expressed urothelial cell markers (CK7, CK20, and UPK3A) and exhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. In a cell viability assay, the response to combined treatment with a range of anticancer drugs (cisplatin, vinblastine, gemcitabine or piroxicam) was markedly different in each BC organoid. In RNA-sequencing analysis, expression levels of basal cell markers (CK5 and DSG3) and several novel genes (MMP28, CTSE, CNN3, TFPI2, COL17A1, and AGPAT4) were upregulated in BC organoids compared with normal bladder tissues or two-dimensional (2D) BC cell lines. These established dog BC organoids might be a useful tool, not only to determine suitable chemotherapy for BC diseased dogs but also to identify novel biomarkers in human muscle-invasive BC. In the present study, for the 1st time, dog BC organoids were generated and several specifically upregulated organoid genes were identified. Our data suggest that dog BC organoids might become a new tool to provide fresh insights into both dog BC therapy and diagnostic biomarkers.                © 2019 The Authors.

31694835        	Organoid Cultures as Preclinical Models of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.            	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is an unmet need to develop novel clinically relevant models of NSCLC to accelerate identification of drug targets and our understanding of the disease.                Thirty surgically resected NSCLC primary patient tissue and 35 previously established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were processed for organoid culture establishment. Organoids were histologically and molecularly characterized by cytology and histology, exome sequencing, and RNA-sequencing analysis. Tumorigenicity was assessed through subcutaneous injection of organoids in NOD/SCID mice. Organoids were subjected to drug testing using EGFR, FGFR, and MEK-targeted therapies.                We have identified cell culture conditions favoring the establishment of short-term and long-term expansion of NSCLC organoids derived from primary lung patient and PDX tumor tissue. The NSCLC organoids recapitulated the histology of the patient and PDX tumor. They also retained tumorigenicity, as evidenced by cytologic features of malignancy, xenograft formation, preservation of mutations, copy number aberrations, and gene expression profiles between the organoid and matched parental tumor tissue by whole-exome and RNA sequencing. NSCLC organoid models also preserved the sensitivity of the matched parental tumor to targeted therapeutics, and could be used to validate or discover biomarker-drug combinations.                Our panel of NSCLC organoids closely recapitulates the genomics and biology of patient tumors, and is a potential platform for drug testing and biomarker validation.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30414038        	Appendiceal Cancer Patient-Specific Tumor Organoid Model for Predicting Chemotherapy Efficacy Prior to Initiation of Treatment: A Feasibility Study.            	We have hypothesized that biofabrication of appendiceal tumor organoids allows for a more personalized clinical approach and facilitates research in a rare disease.                Appendiceal cancer specimens obtained during cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy procedures (CRS/HIPEC) were dissociated and incorporated into an extracellular matrix-based hydrogel system as three-dimensional (3D), patient-specific tumor organoids. Cells were not sorted, preserving tumor heterogeneity, including stroma and immune cell components. Following establishment of organoid sets, chemotherapy drugs were screened in parallel. Live/dead staining and quantitative metabolism assays recorded which chemotherapies were most effective in killing cancer cells for a specific patient. Maintenance of cancer phenotypes were confirmed by using immunohistochemistry.                Biospecimens from 12 patients were applied for organoid development between November 2016 and May 2018. Successful establishment rate of viable organoid sets was 75% (9/12). Average time from organoid development to chemotherapy testing was 7 days. These tumors included three high-grade appendiceal (HGA) and nine low-grade appendiceal (LGA) primaries obtained from sites of peritoneal metastasis. All tumor organoids were tested with chemotherapeutic agents exhibited responses that were either similar to the patient response or within the variability of the expected clinical response. More specifically, HGA tumor organoids derived from different patients demonstrated variable chemotherapy tumor-killing responses, whereas LGA organoids tested with the same regimens showed no response to chemotherapy. One LGA set of organoids was immune-enhanced with cells from a patient-matched lymph node to demonstrate feasibility of a symbiotic 3D reconstruction of a patient matched tumor and immune system component.                Development of 3D appendiceal tumor organoids is feasible even in low cellularity LGA tumors, allowing for individual patient tumors to remain viable for research and personalized drug screening.	
32696980        	Molecular characterization of organoids derived from pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.            	Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are commonly identified non-invasive cyst-forming pancreatic neoplasms with the potential to progress into invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma. There are few in vitro models with which to study the biology of IPMNs and their progression to invasive carcinoma. Therefore, we generated a living biobank of organoids from seven normal pancreatic ducts and ten IPMNs. We characterized eight IPMN organoid samples using whole genome sequencing and characterized five IPMN organoids and seven normal pancreatic duct organoids using transcriptome sequencing. We identified an average of 11,344 somatic mutations in the genomes of organoids derived from IPMNs, with one sample harboring 61,537 somatic mutations enriched for T→C transitions and T→A transversions. Recurrent coding somatic mutations were identified in 15 genes, including KRAS, GNAS, RNF43, PHF3, and RBM10. The most frequently mutated genes were KRAS, GNAS, and RNF43, with somatic mutations identified in six (75%), four (50%), and three (37.5%) IPMN organoid samples, respectively. On average, we identified 36 structural variants in IPMN derived organoids, and none had an unstable phenotype (> 200 structural variants). Transcriptome sequencing identified 28 genes differentially expressed between normal pancreatic duct organoid and IPMN organoid samples. The most significantly upregulated and downregulated genes were CLDN18 and FOXA1. Immunohistochemical analysis of FOXA1 expression in 112 IPMNs, 113 mucinous cystic neoplasms, and 145 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas demonstrated statistically significant loss of expression in low-grade IPMNs (p < 0.0016), mucinous cystic neoplasms (p < 0.0001), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of any histologic grade (p < 0.0001) compared to normal pancreatic ducts. These data indicate that FOXA1 loss of expression occurs early in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Our study highlights the utility of organoid culture to study the genetics and biology of normal pancreatic duct and IPMNs. © 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

33645143        	[Exploration of organoid in breast cancer related research].            	Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. At present, the in vivo model and traditional cell culture are mainly used in breast cancer researches. However, as high as 90% clinical trials are failed for drugs explored by the above two methods, due to the inherent species differences between humans and animals, as well as the differences in the tissue structure between organs and cells. Therefore, organoid three-dimensional culture is emerging. As a new tumor research model, organoid, a three-dimensional cell complex with spatial structure, has broad application prospects, such as precision medicine, organ transplantation, establishment of refractory disease model, gene therapy and drug research and development. Therefore, organoid is considered as one of the ideal carriers for life science research in the future. Breast cancer, a heterogeneous disease with complex phenotypes, has a low survival rate. Breast cancer organoid can reproduce many key features of human breast cancer, thus, the construction of organoid biological library of breast cancer will provide a new platform for studying the occurrence, development, metastasis and drug resistance mechanism of breast cancer. In this review, we systematically introduce the culture conditions of organoids and their application in breast cancer related research, and the application prospect of organoids.	
30522949        	An Organoid-Based Preclinical Model of Human Gastric Cancer.            	Our goal was to develop an initial study for the proof of concept whereby gastric cancer organoids are used as an approach to predict the tumor response in individual patients.                Organoids were derived from resected gastric cancer tumors (huTGOs) or normal stomach tissue collected from sleeve gastrectomies (huFGOs). Organoid cultures were treated with standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs corresponding to patient treatment: epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Organoid response to chemotherapeutic treatment was correlated with the tumor response in each patient from whom the huTGOs were derived. HuTGOs were orthotopically transplanted into the gastric mucosa of NOD scid gamma mice.                Whereas huFGOs exhibited a half maximal inhibitory concentration that was similar among organoid lines, divergent responses and varying half maximal inhibitory concentration values among the huTGO lines were observed in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. HuTGOs that were sensitive to treatment were derived from a patient with a near complete tumor response to chemotherapy. However, organoids resistant to treatment were derived from patients who exhibited no response to chemotherapy. Orthotropic transplantation of organoids resulted in the engraftment and development of human adenocarcinoma. RNA sequencing revealed that huTGOs closely resembled the patient's native tumor tissue and not commonly used gastric cancer cell lines and cell lines derived from the organoid cultures.                The treatment of patient-derived organoids alongside patients from whom cultures were derived will ultimately test their usefulness to predict individual therapy response and patient outcome.

30219074        	Organoid technology and applications in cancer research.            	During the past decade, the three-dimensional organoid technology has sprung up and become more and more popular among researchers. Organoids are the miniatures of in vivo tissues and organs, and faithfully recapitulate the architectures and distinctive functions of a specific organ.These amazing three-dimensional constructs represent a promising, near-physiological model for human cancers, and tremendously support diverse potential applications in cancer research. Up to now, highly efficient establishment of organoids can be achieved from both normal and malignant tissues of patients. Using this bioengineered platform, the links of infection-cancer progression and mutation-carcinogenesis are feasible to be modeled. Another potential application is that organoid technology facilitates drug testing and guides personalized therapy. Although organoids still fail to model immune system accurately, co-cultures of organoids and lymphocytes have been reported in several studies, bringing hope for further application of this technology in immunotherapy. In addition, the potential value in regeneration medicine might be another paramount branch of organoid technology, which might refine current transplantation therapy through the replacement of irreversibly progressively diseased organs with isogenic healthy organoids.In conclusion, organoids represent an excellent preclinical model for human tumors, promoting the translation from basic cancer research to clinical practice. In this review, we outline organoid technology and summarize its applications in cancer research.	
32084293        	A synopsis of prostate organoid methodologies, applications, and limitations.            	Current in vitro modeling systems do not fully reflect the biologic and clinical diversity of prostate cancer (PCa). Organoids are 3D in vitro cell cultures that recapitulate disease heterogeneity, retain prostate gland architecture, and mirror parental tumor characteristics.                To make better use of organoid models in the PCa research field, we provide a review of cutting-edge prostate organoid methodologies, applications, and limitations.                We summarize methodologies for the establishment of benign prostate and PCa organoids and describe some of the model's practical applications and challenges. We highlight the patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-organoid interface model, which may allow for the generation of organoids from primary and rare PCa subtypes. Finally, we discuss potential future utilizations of PCa organoids in the realms of drug development and precision oncology.                Organoids represent a quasi in vivo modeling system that can be easily amenable to genetic modification and functional studies. As such, organoids may serve as an intermediate preclinical model for studying PCa. Future directions may include the refinement of culturing conditions to increase drug response fidelity in PCa organoids. The PDX-organoid interface model may enable the future establishment of primary and rare subtype PCa organoid lines.                © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
31319967        	Organoid culture containing cancer cells and stromal cells reveals that podoplanin-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts enhance proliferation of lung cancer cells.            	Podoplanin-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in tumor progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of podoplanin (+) CAFs on the proliferation of cancer cells using a three-dimensional (3D) organoid model.                We examined the success rate of organoid culture containing PC-9 cancer cells and CAFs. Thereafter, we compared the proliferating index (MIB-1 index) of PC-9 cells co-cultured with podoplanin-overexpressing CAFs and control CAFs using organoid specimens. Furthermore, we compared the MIB-1 labeling index of cancer cells in podoplanin (+) CAFs cases (n = 13) and podoplanin (-) CAFs cases (n = 14) using surgically resected adenocarcinoma specimens.                Without CAFs, PC-9 cells did not form any organoid (success rate: 0%). When PC-9 cells were mixed with CAFs (1:10), the mixed cells generated round and steric aggregates (hybrid cancer organoids, success rate: 100%). In three independent experiments, the MIB-1 index of PC-9 cells in hybrid cancer organoids containing podoplanin-overexpressing CAFs was significantly higher than that of PC-9 cells in organoids containing control CAFs (Exp. 1: 40.4% vs. 24.4%; Exp. 2: 40.0% vs. 24.5%; Exp. 3: 40.3% vs. 25.2%; p < 0.001). Surgically resected human tumors revealed that the MIB-1 index of adenocarcinoma cells was significantly higher in the case of podoplanin (+) CAFs than in the case of podoplanin (-) CAFs (34.8% vs. 16.2%; p < 0.01).                Our data suggested that the hybrid cancer organoid model might reflect the growth-promoting effect of podoplanin (+) CAFs in cancer cells, and this new system can be a useful tool for evaluating the tumor microenvironment.

29024204        	Establishment of a dog primary prostate cancer organoid using the urine cancer stem cells.            	Dog spontaneously develop prostate cancer (PC) like humans. Because most dogs with PC have a poor prognosis, they could be used as a translational model for advanced PC in humans. Stem cell-derived 3-D organoid culture could recapitulate organ structures and physiology. Using patient tissues, a human PC organoid culture system was established. Recent study has shown that urine cells also possess the characteristic of stem cells. However, urine cell-derived PC organoids have never been produced. Therefore, we generated PC organoids using the dog urine samples. Urine organoids were successfully generated from each dog with PC. Each organoid showed cystic structures and resembled the epithelial structures of original tissues. Expression of an epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, and a myofibloblast marker, α-SMA, was observed in the urine organoids. The organoids also expressed a basal cell marker, CK5, and a luminal cell marker, CK8. CD49f-sorted basal cell organoids rapidly grew compared with CD24-sorted luminal cell organoids. The population of CD44-positive cells was the highest in both organoids and the original urine cells. Tumors were successfully formed with the injection of the organoids into immunodeficient mice. Treatment with a microtubule inhibitor, docetaxel, but not a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, piroxicam, and an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, decreased the cell viability of organoids. Treatment with a Hedgehog signal inhibitor, GANT61, increased the radiosensitivity in the organoids. These findings revealed that PC organoids using urine might become a useful tool for investigating the mechanisms of the pathogenesis and treatment of PC in dogs.                © 2017 The Authors.

31884964        	Emerging organoid models: leaping forward in cancer research.            	Cancer heterogeneity is regarded as the main reason for the failure of conventional cancer therapy. The ability to reconstruct intra- and interpatient heterogeneity in cancer models is crucial for understanding cancer biology as well as for developing personalized anti-cancer therapy. Cancer organoids represent an emerging approach for creating patient-derived in vitro cancer models that closely recapitulate the pathophysiological features of natural tumorigenesis and metastasis. Meanwhile, cancer organoids have recently been utilized in the discovery of personalized anti-cancer therapy and prognostic biomarkers. Further, the synergistic combination of cancer organoids with organ-on-a-chip and 3D bioprinting presents a new avenue in the development of more sophisticated and optimized model systems to recapitulate complex cancer-stroma or multiorgan metastasis. Here, we summarize the recent advances in cancer organoids from a perspective of the in vitro emulation of natural cancer evolution and the applications in personalized cancer theranostics. We also discuss the challenges and trends in reconstructing more comprehensive cancer models for basic and clinical cancer research.	
31175091        	Patient-Derived Cancer Organoid Cultures to Predict Sensitivity to Chemotherapy and Radiation.            	Cancer treatment is limited by inaccurate predictors of patient-specific therapeutic response. Therefore, some patients are exposed to unnecessary side effects and delays in starting effective therapy. A clinical tool that predicts treatment sensitivity for individual patients is needed.                Patient-derived cancer organoids were derived across multiple histologies. The histologic characteristics, mutation profile, clonal structure, and response to chemotherapy and radiation were assessed using bright-field and optical metabolic imaging on spheroid and single-cell levels, respectively.                We demonstrate that patient-derived cancer organoids represent the cancers from which they were derived, including key histologic and molecular features. These cultures were generated from numerous cancers, various biopsy sample types, and in different clinical settings. Next-generation sequencing reveals the presence of subclonal populations within the organoid cultures. These cultures allow for the detection of clonal heterogeneity with a greater sensitivity than bulk tumor sequencing. Optical metabolic imaging of these organoids provides cell-level quantification of treatment response and tumor heterogeneity allowing for resolution of therapeutic differences between patient samples. Using this technology, we prospectively predict treatment response for a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer.                These studies add to the literature demonstrating feasibility to grow clinical patient-derived organotypic cultures for treatment effectiveness testing. Together, these culture methods and response assessment techniques hold great promise to predict treatment sensitivity for patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32929210        	Establishment of patient-derived cancer organoids for drug-screening applications.            	Adult stem cell-based organoid technology is a versatile tool for the generation and long-term maintenance of near-native 3D epithelial tissues in vitro. The generation of cancer organoids from primary patient material enables a range of therapeutic agents to be tested in the resulting organoid cultures. Patient-derived cancer organoids therefore hold great promise for personalized medicine. Here, we provide an overview of the protocols used by different groups to establish organoids from various epithelial tissues and cancers, plus the different protocols subsequently used to test the in vitro therapy sensitivity of these patient-derived organoids. We also provide an in-depth protocol for the generation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma organoids and their subsequent use in semi-automated therapy screens. Establishment of organoids and subsequent screening can be performed within 3 months, although this timeline is highly dependent on a.o. starting material and the number of therapies tested. The protocol provided may serve as a reference to successfully establish organoids from other cancer types and perform drug screenings thereof.	
31488816        	Patient-derived lung cancer organoids as in vitro cancer models for therapeutic screening.            	Lung cancer shows substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity across individuals, driving a need for personalised medicine. Here, we report lung cancer organoids and normal bronchial organoids established from patient tissues comprising five histological subtypes of lung cancer and non-neoplastic bronchial mucosa as in vitro models representing individual patient. The lung cancer organoids recapitulate the tissue architecture of the primary lung tumours and maintain the genomic alterations of the original tumours during long-term expansion in vitro. The normal bronchial organoids maintain cellular components of normal bronchial mucosa. Lung cancer organoids respond to drugs based on their genomic alterations: a BRCA2-mutant organoid to olaparib, an EGFR-mutant organoid to erlotinib, and an EGFR-mutant/MET-amplified organoid to crizotinib. Considering the short length of time from organoid establishment to drug testing, our newly developed model may prove useful for predicting patient-specific drug responses through in vitro patient-specific drug trials.	
29703791        	Human gastric cancer modelling using organoids.            	Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. In this study, human and mouse gastric cancer organoids were generated to model the disease and perform drug testing to delineate treatment strategies.                Human gastric cancer organoid cultures were established, samples classified according to their molecular profile and their response to conventional chemotherapeutics tested. Targeted treatment was performed according to specific druggable mutations. Mouse gastric cancer organoid cultures were generated carrying molecular subtype-specific alterations.                Twenty human gastric cancer organoid cultures were established and four selected for a comprehensive in-depth analysis. Organoids demonstrated divergent growth characteristics and morphologies. Immunohistochemistry showed similar characteristics to the corresponding primary tissue. A divergent response to 5-fluoruracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, epirubicin and docetaxel treatment was observed. Whole genome sequencing revealed a mutational spectrum that corresponded to the previously identified microsatellite instable, genomic stable and chromosomal instable subtypes of gastric cancer. The mutational landscape allowed targeted therapy with trastuzumab for ERBB2 alterations and palbociclib for CDKN2A loss. Mouse cancer organoids carrying Kras and Tp53 or Apc and Cdh1 mutations were characterised and serve as model system to study the signalling of induced pathways.                We generated human and mouse gastric cancer organoids modelling typical characteristics and altered pathways of human gastric cancer. Successful interference with activated pathways demonstrates their potential usefulness as living biomarkers for therapy response testing.                © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

31078736        	Organoid technology in cancer precision medicine.            	Organoid technology has been remarkably improved over the last decade. Various organoids have been derived from different types of tissues and recapitulate their organ-specific gene expression signatures, particular tissue spatial structures and functions of their original tissue. The patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been used to elucidate crucial scientific questions, including the relationships between genetic/epigenetic alterations and drug responses, cell plasticity during disease progressions, and mechanisms of drug resistances. With the great expectations, PDOs will be widely used to facilitate the personalized medical decisions, which have the potential to profoundly improve patient outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the developmental details, current achievements, applications and challenges of organoid technology in precision cancer medicine.

33043499        	Small subset of Wnt-activated cells is an initiator of regrowth in colorectal cancer organoids after irradiation.            	Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) are differentiated adenocarcinomas, which maintain expression of both stemness and differentiation markers. This observation suggests that CRC cells could retain a regeneration system of normal cells upon injury. However, the role of stemness in cancer cell regeneration after irradiation is poorly understood. Here, we examined the effect of radiation on growth, stemness, and differentiation in organoids derived from differentiated adenocarcinomas. Following a sublethal dose of irradiation, proliferation and stemness markers, including Wnt target genes, were drastically reduced, but differentiation markers remained. After a static growth phase after high dose of radiation, regrowth foci appeared; these consisted of highly proliferating cells that expressed stem cell markers. Radiosensitivity and the ability to form foci differed among the cancer tissue-originated spheroid (CTOS) lines examined and showed good correlation with in vivo radiation sensitivity. Pre-treating organoids with histone deacetylase inhibitors increased radiation sensitivity; this increase was accompanied by the suppression of Wnt signal-related gene expression. Accordingly, Wnt inhibitors increased organoid radiosensitivity. These results suggested that only a small subset of, but not all, cancer cells with high Wnt activity at the time of irradiation could give rise to foci formation. In conclusion, we established a radiation sensitivity assay using CRC organoids that could provide a novel platform for evaluating the effects of radiosensitizers on differentiated adenocarcinomas in CRC.                © 2020 The Authors.

31101504        	Efficient use of patient-derived organoids as a preclinical model for gynecologic tumors.            	The relevance of patient-derived cancer cells has been recently increasing, particularly in terms of drug discovery and precision medicine. Whereas Matrigel-based organoid culture is a promising technique that enables infinite proliferation of cells from many types of organs in a physiological condition, its validity in gynecologic tumors remains to be established. To address this issue, we aimed at developing an efficient method for organoid culture of both ovarian and endometrial tumors.                We conducted 3D culture of 21 gynecologic tumors following our original and modified protocol for Matrigel bilayer organoid culture. We investigated whether propagated organoids retained various features of the original tumors by histopathological examination and targeted genome sequencing.                We customized the protocol we previously optimized for murine normal and cancer tissues, so as to circumvent the digestion-resistant nature inherent to gynecologic tumors. Indeed, this modified protocol improved the success rate from 45 to 90%, for robust propagation of organoids from tumors with various stages and subtypes. Finally, 14 patient-derived organoids were established. The recovered organoids were enriched for cancer cells that retained many aspects of the original tumors, including histological features, mutation profiles, and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. A subset of the expanded organoids could develop xenografts in immunodeficient mice, potentially paving the way to drug screening in vivo. Drug response assay in vitro for paclitaxel and cisplatin was feasible using organoid-derived spheroids.                We showed that patient-derived organoids closely resembled the original gynecologic tumors, and thereby would serve as a promising resource for preclinical studies.                Copyright © 2019.

32249764        	Organoid cultures from normal and cancer-prone human breast tissues preserve complex epithelial lineages.            	Recently, organoid technology has been used to generate a large repository of breast cancer organoids. Here we present an extensive evaluation of the ability of organoid culture technology to preserve complex stem/progenitor and differentiated cell types via long-term propagation of normal human mammary tissues. Basal/stem and luminal progenitor cells can differentiate in culture to generate mature basal and luminal cell types, including ER+ cells that have been challenging to maintain in culture. Cells associated with increased cancer risk can also be propagated. Single-cell analyses of matched organoid cultures and native tissues by mass cytometry for 38 markers provide a higher resolution representation of the multiple mammary epithelial cell types in the organoids, and demonstrate that protein expression patterns of the tissue of origin can be preserved in culture. These studies indicate that organoid cultures provide a valuable platform for studies of mammary differentiation, transformation, and breast cancer risk.	
30787188        	Mouse and human urothelial cancer organoids: A tool for bladder cancer research.            	Bladder cancer is a common malignancy that has a relatively poor outcome. Lack of culture models for the bladder epithelium (urothelium) hampers the development of new therapeutics. Here we present a long-term culture system of the normal mouse urothelium and an efficient culture system of human bladder cancer cells. These so-called bladder (cancer) organoids consist of 3D structures of epithelial cells that recapitulate many aspects of the urothelium. Mouse bladder organoids can be cultured efficiently and genetically manipulated with ease, which was exemplified by creating genetic knockouts in the tumor suppressors Trp53 and Stag2. Human bladder cancer organoids can be derived efficiently from both resected tumors and biopsies and cultured and passaged for prolonged periods. We used this feature of human bladder organoids to create a living biobank consisting of bladder cancer organoids derived from 53 patients. Resulting organoids were characterized histologically and functionally. Organoid lines contained both basal and luminal bladder cancer subtypes based on immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis. Common bladder cancer mutations like TP53 and FGFR3 were found in organoids in the biobank. Finally, we performed limited drug testing on organoids in the bladder cancer biobank.	
27628132        	Drug Sensitivity Assays of Human Cancer Organoid Cultures.            	Drug sensitivity testing utilizing preclinical disease models such as cancer cell lines is an important and widely used tool for drug development. Importantly, when combined with molecular data such as gene copy number variation or somatic coding mutations, associations between drug sensitivity and molecular data can be used to develop markers to guide patient therapies. The use of organoids as a preclinical cancer model has become possible following recent work demonstrating that organoid cultures can be derived from patient tumors with a high rate of success. A genetic analysis of colon cancer organoids found that these models encompassed the majority of the somatic variants present within the tumor from which it was derived, and capture much of the genetic diversity of colon cancer observed in patients. Importantly, the systematic sensitivity testing of organoid cultures to anticancer drugs identified clinical gene-drug interactions, suggestive of their potential as preclinical models for testing anticancer drug sensitivity. In this chapter, we describe how to perform medium/high-throughput drug sensitivity screens using 3D organoid cell cultures.	
32932156        	Organoid models in gynaecological oncology research.            	Cell culture and animal models represent experimental cornerstones for the investigation of tissue, organ and body physiology in the context of gynaecological research. However, their ability to accurately reflect human mechanisms in vivo is limited. The development of organoid technologies has begun to address this limitation by providing platforms ex vivo that resemble the phenotype and genotype of the multi-cellular tissue from which they were derived more accurately. In this review, we discuss advances in organoid derivation from endometrial, ovarian, fallopian tube and cervical tissue, both benign and malignant, the manipulation of organoid microenvironment to preserve stem cell populations and achieve long-term expansion and we explore the morphological and molecular kinship of organoids to parent tissue. Apart from providing new insight into mechanisms of carcinogenesis, gynaecological cancer-derived organoids can be utilised as tools for drug screening of chemotherapeutic and hormonal compounds where they exhibit interpatient variability consistent with states in vivo and xenografted tumours allowing for patient-tailored treatment strategies. Bridging organoid with bioengineering accomplishments is clearly the way forward to the generation of organoid-on-a-chip technologies enhancing the robustness of the model and its translational potential. Undeniably, organoids are expected to stand their ground in the years to come and revolutionize development and disease modelling studies.                Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	
30289434        	Modeling liver cancer and therapy responsiveness using organoids derived from primary mouse liver tumors.            	The current understanding of cancer biology and development of effective treatments for cancer remain far from satisfactory. This in turn heavily relies on the availability of easy and robust model systems that resemble the architecture/physiology of the tumors in patients to facilitate research. Cancer research in vitro has mainly been based on the use of immortalized 2D cancer cell lines that deviate in many aspects from the original primary tumors. The recent development of the organoid technology allowing generation of organ-buds in 3D culture from adult stem cells has endowed the possibility of establishing stable culture from primary tumors. Although culturing organoids from liver tumors is thought to be difficult, we now convincingly demonstrate the establishment of organoids from mouse primary liver tumors. We have succeeded in culturing 91 lines from 129 liver tissue/tumors. These organoids can be grown in long-term cultures in vitro. About 20% of these organoids form tumors in immunodeficient mice upon (serial) transplantation, confirming their tumorigenic and self-renewal properties. Interestingly, single cells from the tumor organoids have high efficiency of organoid initiation, and a single organoid derived from a cancer cell is able to initiate a tumor in mice, indicating the enrichment of tumor-initiating cells in the tumor organoids. Furthermore, these organoids recapitulate, to some extent, the heterogeneity of liver cancer in patients, with respect to phenotype, cancer cell composition and treatment response. These model systems shall provide enormous opportunities to advance our research on liver cancer (stem cell) biology, drug development and personalized medicine.                © The Author(s) 2018.

31829259        	Characterization of organoid cultured human breast cancer.            	Organoid cultures are increasingly used to model human cancers experimentally with a view to tailoring personalized medicine and predicting drug responses. Breast cancer is no exception, but in particular, primary breast cancer poses some inherent difficulties due to the frequent presence of residual non-malignant cells in the biopsies. We originally developed an assay for the distinction between malignant and non-malignant structures in primary breast cancer organoid cultures (Petersen et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA) 89(19):9064-8, 1992). Here, we apply this assay to assess the frequency of normal-like organoids in primary breast carcinoma cultures and the cellular composition as a consequence of passaging. We find that in consecutively collected samples of primary human breast cancers, residual non-malignant tissues were observed histologically in five out of ten biopsies. Based on relevant morphogenesis and correct polarization as recorded by expression in luminal epithelial cells of mucin 1 (Muc1), occludin, and keratin 19 (K19) and expression in basal cells of integrin β4, p63, and K14, non-malignant organoids were present in all primary human breast cancer-derived cultures. Furthermore, passaging in a contemporary culture medium was in favor of the selective expansion of basal-like cells. We conclude that organoid cultures of human breast cancers are most representative of the tissue origin in primary culture.	
30527243        	Head and neck cancer organoids established by modification of the CTOS method can be used to predict in vivo drug sensitivity.            	Currently there are no standard biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) response to therapy. This is, due to a lack of adequate predictive tumor models. To this end, we established cancer organoid lines from individual patient's tumors, and characterized their growth characteristics and response to different drug treatments with the objective of using these models for prediction of treatment response.                Forty-three patients' samples were processed to establish organoids. To analyze the character of these organoids, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, drug sensitivity assays, clonogenic survival assays, and animal experiments were performed. The HPV status and TP53 mutational status were also confirmed in these lines.                HNSCC organoids were successfully established with success rate of 30.2%. Corresponding two-dimensional cell lines were established from HNSCC organoids at higher success rate (53.8%). These organoids showed similar histological features and stem cell, epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression to the original tumors, thus recapitulating many of the characteristics of the original tumor cells. The cisplatin and docetaxel IC50 were determined for HNSCC organoids and the corresponding 2D cell lines using drug sensitivity and clonogenic survival assays. Responses to drug treatment in vivo were found to be similar to the IC50 calculated from organoids by drug sensitivity assays in vitro.                We established novel in vitro HNSCC cancer organoid lines retaining many properties of the original tumors from they were derived. These organoids can predict in vivo drug sensitivity and may represent useful tools to develop precision treatments for HNSCC.                Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

27748340        	Organoid Culture of Isolated Cells from Patient-derived Tissues with Colorectal Cancer.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease; current research relies on cancer cell lines and animal cancer models, which may not precisely imitate inner human tumors and guide clinical medicine. The purpose of our study was to explore and further improve the process of producing three-dimensional (3D) organoid model and impel the development of personalized therapy.                We subcutaneously injected surgically resected CRC tissues from a patient into BALB/c-nu mice to build patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Isolated cells from PDXs at appropriate tumor size were mingled with Matrigel, and then seeded in ultra-low attachment 96-well plates at four cell densities (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 single cells/well). Cells were cultured with advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/F12 medium additional with various factors added to maintain tumor's biological traits and growth activity. The growth curves of the four cell densities were measured after 24 h of culture until 25 days. We evaluated the effects of four chemotherapeutic agents on organoid model by the CellTiter-Glo ® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining of 3D organoids was performed and compared with patient and CRC PDX tissues. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed, in which the organoids were stained with the proliferation marker, Ki-67. During the experimental process, a phase-contrast microscope was used.                Phenotype experimental results showed that 3D organoids were tightly packed together and grew robustly over time. All four densities of cells formed organoids while that composed of 2000 cells/well provided an adequate cultivation system and grew approximately 8-fold at the 25 th day. The chemosensitivity of the four conventional drugs was [s]-10-hydroxycamptothecin > mitomycin C > adriamycin > paclitaxel, which can guide clinical treatment. Histological features of CRC patient's tumor tissues and mice tumor xenograft tissues were highly similar, with high-column-like epithelium and extracellular matrix. H and E-stained sections showed heterogeneous cell populations harbored in cancer organoids and were histologically similar to tumor tissues. The proliferation index was only 8.33% within spheroids, which exhibited confined proliferative cells that might be cancer stem cells.                We successfully constructed a CRC organoid model that grew robustly over 25 days and demonstrated that 2000 cells/well in 96-well plate was a prime seeding density for cells to form organoids. The results confirmed that organoid model can be used for agent screening and personalized medicine.	
31171691        	Cancer modeling meets human organoid technology.            	Organoids are microscopic self-organizing, three-dimensional structures that are grown from stem cells in vitro. They recapitulate many structural and functional aspects of their in vivo counterpart organs. This versatile technology has led to the development of many novel human cancer models. It is now possible to create indefinitely expanding organoids starting from tumor tissue of individuals suffering from a range of carcinomas. Alternatively, CRISPR-based gene modification allows the engineering of organoid models of cancer through the introduction of any combination of cancer gene alterations to normal organoids. When combined with immune cells and fibroblasts, tumor organoids become models for the cancer microenvironment enabling immune-oncology applications. Emerging evidence indicates that organoids can be used to accurately predict drug responses in a personalized treatment setting. Here, we review the current state and future prospects of the rapidly evolving tumor organoid field.

29224780        	A Living Biobank of Breast Cancer Organoids Captures Disease Heterogeneity.            	Breast cancer (BC) comprises multiple distinct subtypes that differ genetically, pathologically, and clinically. Here, we describe a robust protocol for long-term culturing of human mammary epithelial organoids. Using this protocol, >100 primary and metastatic BC organoid lines were generated, broadly recapitulating the diversity of the disease. BC organoid morphologies typically matched the histopathology, hormone receptor status, and HER2 status of the original tumor. DNA copy number variations as well as sequence changes were consistent within tumor-organoid pairs and largely retained even after extended passaging. BC organoids furthermore populated all major gene-expression-based classification groups and allowed in vitro drug screens that were consistent with in vivo xeno-transplantations and patient response. This study describes a representative collection of well-characterized BC organoids available for cancer research and drug development, as well as a strategy to assess in vitro drug response in a personalized fashion.

31150736        	Establishing Pure Cancer Organoid Cultures: Identification, Selection and Verification of Cancer Phenotypes and Genotypes.            	Precision medicine requires in vitro models which will both faithfully recapitulate the features of an individual's disease and enable drug testing on a wide variety of samples covering the greatest range of phenotypes possible for a particular disease. Organoid technology has immense potential to fulfill this demand, but it will be necessary to develop robust protocols that enable the generation of organoids in a dependable manner from nearly every patient. Here we provide a user's guide, including detailed step-by-step protocols, to the establishment, isolation and verification of gastric cancer organoids. Selection strategies include omission of growth factors, addition of drugs, isolation of distinct phenotypes and generation of monoclonal lines. For confirmation of cancer identity, we use sequencing, drug selection, karyotyping and histology. While we specify these protocols for human gastric cancer organoids here, the methods described are applicable to organoids derived from other tissues as well.

32376602        	Pattern of Invasion in Human Pancreatic Cancer Organoids Is Associated with Loss of SMAD4 and Clinical Outcome.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by extensive local invasion and systemic spread. In this study, we employed a three-dimensional organoid model of human pancreatic cancer to characterize the molecular alterations critical for invasion. Time-lapse microscopy was used to observe invasion in organoids from 25 surgically resected human PDAC samples in collagen I. Subsequent lentiviral modification and small-molecule inhibitors were used to investigate the molecular programs underlying invasion in PDAC organoids. When cultured in collagen I, PDAC organoids exhibited two distinct, morphologically defined invasive phenotypes, mesenchymal and collective. Each individual PDAC gave rise to organoids with a predominant phenotype, and PDAC that generated organoids with predominantly mesenchymal invasion showed a worse prognosis. Collective invasion predominated in organoids from cancers with somatic mutations in the driver gene SMAD4 (or its signaling partner TGFBR2). Reexpression of SMAD4 abrogated the collective invasion phenotype in SMAD4-mutant PDAC organoids, indicating that SMAD4 loss is required for collective invasion in PDAC organoids. Surprisingly, invasion in passaged SMAD4-mutant PDAC organoids required exogenous TGFβ, suggesting that invasion in SMAD4-mutant organoids is mediated through noncanonical TGFβ signaling. The Rho-like GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 acted as potential mediators of TGFβ-stimulated invasion in SMAD4-mutant PDAC organoids, as inhibition of these GTPases suppressed collective invasion in our model. These data suggest that PDAC utilizes different invasion programs depending on SMAD4 status, with collective invasion uniquely present in PDAC with SMAD4 loss. SIGNIFICANCE: Organoid models of PDAC highlight the importance of SMAD4 loss in invasion, demonstrating that invasion programs in SMAD4-mutant and SMAD4 wild-type tumors are different in both morphology and molecular mechanism.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
29389521        	The Central Role of Wnt Signaling and Organoid Technology in Personalizing Anticancer Therapy.            	The Wnt pathway is at the heart of organoid technology, which is set to revolutionize the cancer field. We can now predetermine a patient's response to any given anticancer therapy by exposing tumor organoids established from the patient's own tumor. This cutting-edge biomedical platform translates to patients being treated with the correct drug at the correct dose from the outset, a truly personalized and precise medical approach. A high throughput drug screen on organoids also allows drugs to be tested in limitless combinations. More recently, the tumor cells that are resistant to the therapy given to a patient were selected in culture using the patient's organoids. The resistant tumor organoids were then screened empirically to identify drugs that will kill the resistant cells. This information allows diagnosis in real-time to either prevent tumor recurrence or effectively treat the recurring tumor. Furthermore, the ability to culture stem cell-derived epithelium as organoids has enabled us to begin to understand how a stem cell becomes a cancer cell or to pin-point the genetic alteration that underlies a given genetic syndrome. Here we summarize these advances and the central role of Wnt signaling, and identify the next challenges for organoid technology.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
32032677        	Organoid models in lung regeneration and cancer.            	Improper regeneration is associated with lung diseases including lung cancer. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with nearly 2 million new cases diagnosed each year. The diagnosis is often too late for successful therapeutic intervention. Lung cancer shows substantial phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity between individuals, making it difficult to model in animals. Organoids, derived from regional stem/progenitor cells in lung epithelia, have attracted extensive interest in both research studies and the clinic, because of their great potential for use in cancer treatment. Various lung cancer organoids have been established to recapitulate the tissue architecture of primary lung tumors and maintain the genomic alterations of the original tumors during long-term expansion in vitro. In this review, we summarize the current data on lung epithelial regeneration by regional endogenous stem/progenitor cells, describe the development of organoid technology, and present its applications in lung cancer research. Furthermore, recent challenges and future directions to improve organoid technologies for lung cancer treatment are discussed.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
30571609        	Three-Dimensional Organoids in Cancer Research: The Search for the Holy Grail of Preclinical Cancer Modeling.            	Most solid tumors become therapy resistant and will relapse, with no durable treatment option available. One major impediment to our understanding of cancer biology and finding innovative approaches to cancer treatment stems from the lack of better preclinical tumor models that address and explain tumor heterogeneity and person-to-person differences in therapeutic and toxic responses. Past cancer research has been driven by inadequate in vitro assays utilizing two-dimensional monolayers of cancer cells and animal models. Additionally, animal models do not truly mimic the original human tumor, are time consuming, and usually costly. New preclinical models are needed for innovation in cancer translational research. Hence, it is time to welcome the three-dimensional (3D) organoids: self-organizing cells grown in 3D culture systems mimicking the parent tissues from which the primary cells originate. The 3D organoids offer deeper insights into the crucial cellular processes in tissue and organ formation and pathological processes. Generation of near-perfect physiological microenvironments allow 3D organoids to couple with gene editing tools, such as the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 and the transcription activator-like effector nucleases to model human diseases, offering distinct advantages over current models. We explain in this expert review that through recapitulating patients' normal and tumor tissues, organoid technology can markedly advance personalized medicine and help reveal once hidden aspects of cancers. The use of defined tissue- or organ-specific matrices, among other factors, will likely allow organoid technology to realize its potential in innovating many fields of life sciences.	
31128292        	3D gastrointestinal models and organoids to study metabolism in human colon cancer.            	Recent advances in the field of cancer metabolism raised awareness for the importance of the tumour microenvironment in tumour growth and progression. The initial theory by Heinrich Warburg was that cancer cells had a deficient oxidative respiration and thus had to perform aerobic glycolysis to produce energy. However, further research suggested that there is a metabolic reprogramming within the tumour microenvironment, controlled by communication between tumour and stromal cells. The importance of this communication exposes the need to use complex models in cancer research. Until recently, classic cell models included immortalized 2D cell lines or patient-derived tumour xenografts. Despite having contributed to many discoveries, these models present many limitations. Improved models are now being developed using 3D cell culture technology. These models are more physiologically relevant allowing the co-culture of different cells types and establishing a gradient concentration of solutes. Recent developments in organoid technology contributed largely to the expansion of 3D cell technology. Organoids can be developed from different tissues including tumours, representing the cell population and spatial organization of the tissue of origin. In the field of cancer metabolism, the interaction of different cell types, the stroma, and the different solutes and oxygen concentrations are crucial parameters. Current models to study metabolism either include only one cell population or are unable to represent solute/oxygen gradients or to collect samples in a proficient manner. The characteristics of organoid culture thus makes them a potent model to use in metabolic studies, drug development, disease model or even personalized medicine.

29325707        	Successful creation of pancreatic cancer organoids by means of EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy sampling for personalized cancer treatment.            	Pancreatic cancer organoids are tumor models of individualized human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), created from surgical specimens and used for personalized treatment strategies. Unfortunately, most patients with PDA are not operative candidates. Creation of human PDA organoids at the time of initial tumor diagnosis is therefore critical. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of creating human PDA organoids by EUS fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) sampling in patients with PDA.                In this prospective clinical trial in patients referred to evaluate a pancreatic mass, EUS-FNA was performed for initial onsite diagnosis. Two additional needle passes were performed with a 22-gauge FNB needle for organoid creation. Primary outcome was successful isolation of organoids within 2 weeks of EUS-FNB sampling (P0, no passages), confirmed by organoid morphology and positive genotyping.                Thirty-seven patients with 38 PDA tumors were enrolled. Successful isolation of organoids (P0) was achieved in 33 of 38 tumors (87%). Establishment of PDA organoid lines for ≥5 passages of growth (P5, five passages) was reached in 25 of 38 tumors (66%). In the single patient with successful P5 FNB sampling-derived and P5 surgically derived organoids, there was identical matching of specimens. There were no serious adverse events. Two patients developed bleeding at the EUS-FNB puncture site requiring hemostasis clips.                Pancreatic cancer organoids can be successfully and rapidly created by means of EUS-FNB sampling using a 22-gauge needle at the time of initial diagnosis. Successful organoid generation is essential for precision medicine in patients with pancreatic cancer in whom most are not surgically resectable.

31858299        	Model of Patient-Specific Immune-Enhanced Organoids for Immunotherapy Screening: Feasibility Study.            	We hypothesized that engineering a combined lymph node/melanoma organoid from the same patient would allow tumor, stroma, and immune system to remain viable for personalized immunotherapy screening.                Surgically obtained matched melanoma and lymph node biospecimens from the same patient were transferred to the laboratory and washed with saline, antibiotic, and red blood cell lysis buffer. Biospecimens were dissociated, incorporated into an extracellular matrix (ECM)-based hydrogel system, and biofabricated into three dimensional (3D) mixed melanoma/node organoids. Cells were not sorted, so as to preserve tumor heterogeneity, including stroma and immune cell components, resulting in immune-enhanced patient tumor organoids (iPTOs). Organoid sets were screened in parallel with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and dabrafenib/trametinib for 72 h. LIVE/DEAD staining and quantitative metabolism assays recorded relative drug efficacy. Histology and immunohistochemistry were used to compare tumor melanoma cells with organoid melanoma cells. Lastly, node-enhanced iPTOs were employed to activate patient-matched peripheral blood T cells for killing of tumor cells in naïve PTOs.                Ten biospecimen sets obtained from eight stage III and IV melanoma patients were reconstructed as symbiotic immune/tumor organoids between September 2017 and June 2018. Successful establishment of viable organoid sets was 90% (9/10), although organoid yield varied with biospecimen size. Average time from organoid development to initiation of immunotherapy testing was 7 days. In three patients for whom a node was not available, it was substituted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. iPTO response to immunotherapy was similar to specimen clinical response in 85% (6/7) patients. In an additional pilot study, peripheral T cells were circulated through iPTOs, and subsequently transferred to naïve PTOs from the same patient, resulting in tumor killing, suggesting a possible role of iPTOs in generating adaptive immunity.                Development of 3D mixed immune-enhanced tumor/node organoids is a feasible platform, allowing individual patient immune system and tumor cells to remain viable for studying of personalized immunotherapy response.	
33188841        	Cancer-initiating cells in human pancreatic cancer organoids are maintained by interactions with endothelial cells.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) shows poor prognosis and high malignancy due to the presence of cancer-initiating cells (CICs) and characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Organoids are useful for studying PDAC, and establishing organoids is dependent on stem cell growth factors, including Wnt signaling. Herein, using a conventional organoid culture system, we demonstrated that CD44(+)CD24(+) and CD44(+)CD24(+)EpCAM(+) CICs were enriched >65% in a PDAC patient-derived organoid. CICs expressing CD44 formed lumen structures by gathering into circles. Additionally, organoid-derived CD44(-) cancer cells were capable of organoid re-formation and could be re-programed as CD44-expressing CICs in the organoid culture system. To mimic a TME absent artificial stem cell growth factors, a PDAC organoid with vascular niche was established. CICs in the PDAC tumor organoid were maintained by paracrine effects and direct interactions with endothelial cells. Interestingly, CD44(+) cells in PDAC tumor tissue were detected primarily in the vascular niche. Inhibiting both Wnt and Notch signaling in endothelial cells suppressed organoid formation and the maintenance of CD24(+)CD44(+) CICs. Collectively, our results suggest that PDAC patient-derived organoids maintain CICs by interacting with endothelial cells via Wnt and Notch pathways.                Copyright © 2020.

31367720        	A one-stop microfluidic-based lung cancer organoid culture platform for testing drug sensitivity.            	Microfluidic devices as translational research tools provide a potential alternative to animal experiments due to their ability to mimic physiological parameters. Several approaches that can be used to predict the efficacy or toxicity of anticancer drugs are available. In general, standard cell culture systems have the advantages of being relatively cost-effective, having high-throughput capability, and providing convenience. However, these models are inadequate to accurately recapitulate the complex organ-level physiological and pharmacological responses. Here, we present a one-stop microfluidic device enabling both 3-dimensional (3D) lung cancer organoid culturing and drug sensitivity tests directly on a microphysiological system (MPS). Our platform reproducibly yields 3D lung cancer organoids in a size-controllable manner and demonstrates for the first time the production of lung cancer organoids from patients with small-cell lung cancer. Lung cancer organoids derived from primary small-cell lung cancer tumors can rapidly proliferate and exhibit disease-specific characteristics in our MPS. Cisplatin and etoposide, the standard regimen for lung cancer, showed increased apoptosis induction in a concentration-dependent manner, but the organoids contained chemo-resistant cells in the core. We envision that this system may provide important information to guide therapeutic approaches at the preclinical level.	
30981763        	Tumor organoids: From inception to future in cancer research.            	Tumor models have created new avenues for personalized medicine and drug development. A new culture model derived from a three-dimensional system, the tumor organoid, is gradually being used in many fields. An organoid can simulate the physiological structure and function of tissue in situ and maintain the characteristics of tumor cells in vivo, overcoming the disadvantages of traditional experimental tumor models. Organoids can mimic pathological features of tumors and maintain genetic stability, making them suitable for both molecular mechanism studies and pharmacological experiments of clinical transformation. In addition, the application of tumor organoids combined with other technologies, such as liquid biopsy technology, microraft array (MRA), and high-content screening (HCS), for the development of personalized diagnosis and cancer treatment has a promising future. In this review, we introduce the evolution of organoids and discuss their specific application and advantages. We also summarize the characteristics of several tumor organoids culture systems.                Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.	
31492749        	Identification of Resistance Pathways Specific to Malignancy Using Organoid Models of Pancreatic Cancer.            	KRAS is mutated in the majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. MAPK and PI3K-AKT are primary KRAS effector pathways, but combined MAPK and PI3K inhibition has not been demonstrated to be clinically effective to date. We explore the resistance mechanisms uniquely employed by malignant cells.                We evaluated the expression and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases in response to combined MEK and AKT inhibition in KPC mice and pancreatic ductal organoids. In addition, we sought to determine the therapeutic efficacy of targeting resistance pathways induced by MEK and AKT inhibition in order to identify malignant-specific vulnerabilities.                Combined MEK and AKT inhibition modestly extended the survival of KPC mice and increased Egfr and ErbB2 phosphorylation levels. Tumor organoids, but not their normal counterparts, exhibited elevated phosphorylation of ERBB2 and ERBB3 after MEK and AKT blockade. A pan-ERBB inhibitor synergized with MEK and AKT blockade in human PDA organoids, whereas this was not observed for the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Combined MEK and ERBB inhibitor treatment of human organoid orthotopic xenografts was sufficient to cause tumor regression in short-term intervention studies.                Analyses of normal and tumor pancreatic organoids revealed the importance of ERBB activation during MEK and AKT blockade primarily in the malignant cultures. The lack of ERBB hyperactivation in normal organoids suggests a larger therapeutic index. In our models, pan-ERBB inhibition was synergistic with dual inhibition of MEK and AKT, and the combination of a pan-ERBB inhibitor with MEK antagonists showed the highest activity both in vitro and in vivo.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31108870        	Application of Cancer Organoid Model for Drug Screening and Personalized Therapy.            	Drug screening-i.e., testing the effects of a number of drugs in multiple cell lines-is used for drug discovery and development, and can also be performed to evaluate the heterogeneity of a disease entity. Notably, intertumoral heterogeneity is a large hurdle to overcome for establishing standard cancer treatment, necessitating disease models better than conventional established 2D cell lines for screening novel treatment candidates. In the present review, we outline recent progress regarding experimental cancer models having more physiological and clinical relevance for drug screening, which are important for the successful evaluation of cellular response to drugs. The review is particularly focused on drug screening using the cancer organoid model, which is emerging as a better physiological disease model than conventional established 2D cell lines. We also review the use of cancer organoids to examine intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity, and introduce the perspective of the clinical use of cancer organoids to enable precision medicine.	
29625057        	Tumor Evolution and Drug Response in Patient-Derived Organoid Models of Bladder Cancer.            	Bladder cancer is the fifth most prevalent cancer in the U.S., yet is understudied, and few laboratory models exist that reflect the biology of the human disease. Here, we describe a biobank of patient-derived organoid lines that recapitulates the histopathological and molecular diversity of human bladder cancer. Organoid lines can be established efficiently from patient biopsies acquired before and after disease recurrence and are interconvertible with orthotopic xenografts. Notably, organoid lines often retain parental tumor heterogeneity and exhibit a spectrum of genomic changes that are consistent with tumor evolution in culture. Analyses of drug response using bladder tumor organoids show partial correlations with mutational profiles, as well as changes associated with treatment resistance, and specific responses can be validated using xenografts in vivo. Our studies indicate that patient-derived bladder tumor organoids represent a faithful model system for studying tumor evolution and treatment response in the context of precision cancer medicine.

29366522        	Personalized Cancer Medicine: An Organoid Approach.            	Personalized cancer therapy applies specific treatments to each patient. Using personalized tumor models with similar characteristics to the original tumors may result in more accurate predictions of drug responses in patients. Tumor organoid models have several advantages over pre-existing models, including conserving the molecular and cellular composition of the original tumor. These advantages highlight the tremendous potential of tumor organoids in personalized cancer therapy, particularly preclinical drug screening and predicting patient responses to selected treatment regimens. Here, we highlight the advantages, challenges, and translational potential of tumor organoids in personalized cancer therapy and focus on gene-drug associations, drug response prediction, and treatment selection. Finally, we discuss how microfluidic technology can contribute to immunotherapy drug screening in tumor organoids.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	
31752287        	Plocabulin Displays Strong Cytotoxic Activity in a Personalized Colon Cancer Patient-Derived 3D Organoid Assay.            	Plocabulin is a novel microtubule-disrupting antitumor agent of marine origin that is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials. Plocabulin has potent antiproliferative and antiangiogenic actions in carcinoma cell lines and has antitumor activity in xenografted mice. Here, we used three-dimensional (3D) tumor organoids derived from three colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to study the effect of plocabulin in a personalized assay system that ensures dose dependence and high reproducibility. The cytotoxicity of plocabulin was an order of magnitude higher than that of the active irinotecan derivative SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin) in tumor organoids at different passages. Moreover, plocabulin maintained its strong cytotoxic activity in wash-out experiments, in which a short pulse treatment of tumor organoids was as efficient as continuous treatment. Our data show that plocabulin has a very potent cytotoxic action in CRC patient-derived tumor organoids, supporting ongoing clinical trials with plocabulin and the use of organoid assays to provide personalized validation of antitumor drugs.	
31282586        	Xenograft and organoid model systems in cancer research.            	Patient-derived tumour xenografts and tumour organoids have become important preclinical model systems for cancer research. Both models maintain key features from their parental tumours, such as genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which allows them to be used for a wide spectrum of applications. In contrast to patient-derived xenografts, organoids can be established and expanded with high efficiency from primary patient material. On the other hand, xenografts retain tumour-stroma interactions, which are known to contribute to tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss recent advances in patient-derived tumour xenograft and tumour organoid model systems and compare their promises and challenges as preclinical models in cancer research.                © 2019 The Authors.

31216420        	Gut organoids: mini-tissues in culture to study intestinal physiology and disease.            	In vitro, cell cultures are essential tools in the study of intestinal function and disease. For the past few decades, monolayer cellular cultures, such as cancer cell lines or immortalized cell lines, have been widely applied in gastrointestinal research. Recently, the development of three-dimensional cultures known as organoids has permitted the growth of normal crypt-villus units that recapitulate many aspects of intestinal physiology. Organoid culturing has also been applied to study gastrointestinal diseases, intestinal-microbe interactions, and colorectal cancer. These models are amenable to CRISPR gene editing and drug treatments, including high-throughput small-molecule testing. Three-dimensional intestinal cultures have been transplanted into mice to develop versatile in vivo models of intestinal disease, particularly cancer. Limitations of currently available organoid models include cost and challenges in modeling nonepithelial intestinal cells, such as immune cells and the microbiota. Here, we describe the development of organoid models of intestinal biology and the applications of organoids for study of the pathophysiology of intestinal diseases and cancer.	
29642386        	Hedgehog Signals Mediate Anti-Cancer Drug Resistance in Three-Dimensional Primary Colorectal Cancer Organoid Culture.            	Colorectal cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death worldwide. In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, combination treatment with several anti-cancer drugs is employed and improves overall survival in some patients. Nevertheless, most patients with metastatic disease are not cured owing to the drug resistance. Cancer stem cells are known to regulate resistance to chemotherapy. In the previous study, we established a novel three-dimensional organoid culture model from tumor colorectal tissues of human patients using an air-liquid interface (ALI) method, which contained numerous cancer stem cells and showed resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Irinotecan. Here, we investigate which inhibitor for stem cell-related signal improves the sensitivity for anti-cancer drug treatment in tumor ALI organoids. Treatment with Hedgehog signal inhibitors (AY9944, GANT61) decreases the cell viability of organoids compared with Notch (YO-01027, DAPT) and Wnt (WAV939, Wnt-C59) signal inhibitors. Combination treatment of AY9944 or GANT61 with 5-FU, Irinotecan or Oxaliplatin decreases the cell viability of tumor organoids compared with each anti-cancer drug alone treatment. Treatment with AY9944 or GANT61 inhibits expression of stem cell markers c-Myc, CD44 and Nanog, likely through the decrease of their transcription factor, GLI-1 expression. Combination treatment of AY9944 or GANT61 with 5-FU or Irinotecan also prevents colony formation of colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW480. These findings suggest that Hedgehog signals mediate anti-cancer drug resistance in colorectal tumor patient-derived ALI organoids and that the inhibitors are useful as a combinational therapeutic strategy against colorectal cancer.	
31300537        	CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockout in intestinal tumor organoids provides functional validation for colorectal cancer driver genes.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Several genome sequencing studies have provided comprehensive CRC genomic datasets. Likewise, in our previous study, we performed genome-wide Sleeping Beauty transposon-based mutagenesis screening in mice and provided comprehensive datasets of candidate CRC driver genes. However, functional validation for most candidate CRC driver genes, which were commonly identified from both human and mice, has not been performed. Here, we describe a platform for functionally validating CRC driver genes that utilizes CRISPR-Cas9 in mouse intestinal tumor organoids and human CRC-derived organoids in xenograft mouse models. We used genetically defined benign tumor-derived organoids carrying 2 frequent gene mutations (Apc and Kras mutations), which act in the early stage of CRC development, so that we could clearly evaluate the tumorigenic ability of the mutation in a single gene. These studies showed that Acvr1b, Acvr2a, and Arid2 could function as tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in CRC and uncovered a role for Trp53 in tumor metastasis. We also showed that co-occurrent mutations in receptors for activin and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) synergistically promote tumorigenesis, and shed light on the role of activin receptors in CRC. This experimental system can also be applied to mouse intestinal organoids carrying other sensitizing mutations as well as organoids derived from other organs, which could further contribute to identification of novel cancer driver genes and new drug targets.	
29131160        	Human primary liver cancer-derived organoid cultures for disease modeling and drug screening.            	Human liver cancer research currently lacks in vitro models that can faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of the original tumor. We recently described a novel, near-physiological organoid culture system, wherein primary human healthy liver cells form long-term expanding organoids that retain liver tissue function and genetic stability. Here we extend this culture system to the propagation of primary liver cancer (PLC) organoids from three of the most common PLC subtypes: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and combined HCC/CC (CHC) tumors. PLC-derived organoid cultures preserve the histological architecture, gene expression and genomic landscape of the original tumor, allowing for discrimination between different tumor tissues and subtypes, even after long-term expansion in culture in the same medium conditions. Xenograft studies demonstrate that the tumorogenic potential, histological features and metastatic properties of PLC-derived organoids are preserved in vivo. PLC-derived organoids are amenable for biomarker identification and drug-screening testing and led to the identification of the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 as a potential therapeutic agent for primary liver cancer. We thus demonstrate the wide-ranging biomedical utilities of PLC-derived organoid models in furthering the understanding of liver cancer biology and in developing personalized-medicine approaches for the disease.	
30510992        	Three-Dimensional Organoids Reveal Therapy Resistance of Esophageal and Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells.            	Oropharyngeal and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, especially the latter, are a lethal disease, featuring intratumoral cancer cell heterogeneity and therapy resistance. To facilitate cancer therapy in personalized medicine, three-dimensional (3D) organoids may be useful for functional characterization of cancer cells ex vivo. We investigated the feasibility and the utility of patient-derived 3D organoids of esophageal and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.                We generated 3D organoids from paired biopsies representing tumors and adjacent normal mucosa from therapy-naïve patients and cell lines. We evaluated growth and structures of 3D organoids treated with 5-fluorouracil ex vivo.                Tumor-derived 3D organoids were grown successfully from 15 out of 21 patients (71.4%) and passaged with recapitulation of the histopathology of the original tumors. Successful formation of tumor-derived 3D organoids was associated significantly with poor response to presurgical neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy in informative patients (P = 0.0357, progressive and stable diseases, n = 10 vs. partial response, n = 6). The 3D organoid formation capability and 5-fluorouracil resistance were accounted for by cancer cells with high CD44 expression and autophagy, respectively. Such cancer cells were found to be enriched in patient-derived 3D organoids surviving 5-fluorouracil treatment.                The single cell-based 3D organoid system may serve as a highly efficient platform to explore cancer therapeutics and therapy resistance mechanisms in conjunction with morphological and functional assays with implications for translation in personalized medicine.	
32763973        	Modulation of glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I in gastric cancer-derived organoids disrupts homeostatic epithelial cell turnover.            	Programmed cell death promotes homeostatic cell turnover in the epithelium but is dysregulated in cancer. The glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I is known to block homeostatic apoptosis through α2,6-linked sialylation of the death receptor TNFR1 in many cell types. However, its role has not been investigated in gastric epithelial cells or gastric tumorigenesis. We determined that human gastric antral epithelium rarely expressed ST6Gal-I, but the number of ST6Gal-I-expressing epithelial cells increased significantly with advancing premalignancy leading to cancer. The mRNA expression levels of ST6GAL-I and SOX9 in human gastric epithelial cells correlated positively with one another through the premalignancy cascade, indicating that increased epithelial cell expression of ST6Gal-I is associated with premalignant progression. To determine the functional impact of increased ST6Gal-I, we generated human gastric antral organoids from epithelial stem cells and differentiated epithelial monolayers from gastric organoids. Gastric epithelial stem cells strongly expressed ST6Gal-I, suggesting a novel biomarker of stemness. In contrast, organoid-derived epithelial monolayers expressed markedly reduced ST6Gal-I and underwent TNF-induced, caspase-mediated apoptosis, consistent with homeostasis. Conversely, epithelial monolayers generated from gastric cancer stem cells retained high levels of ST6Gal-I and resisted TNF-induced apoptosis, supporting prolonged survival. Protection from TNF-induced apoptosis depended on ST6Gal-I overexpression, because forced ST6Gal-I overexpression in normal gastric stem cell-differentiated monolayers inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis, and cleavage of α2,6-linked sialic acids from gastric cancer organoid-derived monolayers restored susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis. These findings implicate up-regulated ST6Gal-I expression in blocking homeostatic epithelial cell apoptosis in gastric cancer pathogenesis, suggesting a mechanism for prolonged epithelioid tumor cell survival.                © 2020 Alexander et al.	
27654995        	Organoid Culture of Human Cancer Stem Cells.            	Organoid culture is a three-dimensional culture method that enables ex vivo analysis of stem cell behavior and differentiation. This method is also applicable to the studies on stem cell characters of human cancer stem cells. The components of organoid culture include Matrigel® and a culture medium containing growth factor cocktails that mimic the microenvironments of organ stem cell niches. Here, we describe the basic methods for the organoid culture of dissociated or FACS-sorted human cancer stem cells. Then, we introduce a method to dissociate the organoids for serial passage and propagation.	
29180611        	Screening drug effects in patient-derived cancer cells links organoid responses to genome alterations.            	Cancer drug screening in patient-derived cells holds great promise for personalized oncology and drug discovery but lacks standardization. Whether cells are cultured as conventional monolayer or advanced, matrix-dependent organoid cultures influences drug effects and thereby drug selection and clinical success. To precisely compare drug profiles in differently cultured primary cells, we developed DeathPro, an automated microscopy-based assay to resolve drug-induced cell death and proliferation inhibition. Using DeathPro, we screened cells from ovarian cancer patients in monolayer or organoid culture with clinically relevant drugs. Drug-induced growth arrest and efficacy of cytostatic drugs differed between the two culture systems. Interestingly, drug effects in organoids were more diverse and had lower therapeutic potential. Genomic analysis revealed novel links between drug sensitivity and DNA repair deficiency in organoids that were undetectable in monolayers. Thus, our results highlight the dependency of cytostatic drugs and pharmacogenomic associations on culture systems, and guide culture selection for drug tests.                © 2017 The Authors.

30664193        	Sphere‑forming assay vs. organoid culture: Determining long‑term stemness and the chemoresistant capacity of primary colorectal cancer cells.            	Three‑dimensional (3D) cultures are indispensable for capturing tumor heterogeneity in colorectal cancer (CRC) in vitro. Although 3D cultures (such as sphere‑forming assay and organoid culture) can partially preserve the morphological and molecular characteristics of primary CRC, whether these 3D cultures maintain the long‑term stemness of cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains largely unknown. In the present study, spheres and organoids were generated side by side using individual primary CRC specimens, then respectively processed as serial passages. The results revealed that during serial passages, the percentage of CSCs (such as cluster of differentiation‑133+ and Wnt+ cells) in organoids and the tumor‑initiating capacity of organoid‑derived cells were constant, while they gradually increased in the sphere‑derived cells. Furthermore, during serial passages, resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (including 5‑fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) in sphere‑ and organoid‑derived cells was evaluated. The results indicated that the percentage of chemoresistant cells was constant in serial organoid cultures; however, it gradually increased in the serial sphere‑forming assays. Taken together, the results of the present study comprehensively demonstrate that, with regard to long‑term culture in vitro, organoid culture may be useful in maintaining tumor heterogeneity and the levels of chemoresistant cells, while the sphere formation assay enriches for CSCs and chemoresistant cells.	
32253045        	Short-term organoid culture for drug sensitivity testing of high-grade serous carcinoma.            	Cancer patient-derived organoids (PDOs) grow as three dimensional (3D) structures in the presence of extracellular matrix and have been found to represent the original tumor's genetic complexity. In addition, PDOs can be grown and subjected to drug sensitivity testing in a shorter time course and with lesser expense than patient-derived xenograft models. Many patients with recurrent ovarian cancer develop malignant effusions that become refractory to chemotherapy. Since these same patients often present for palliative aspiration of ascites or pleural effusions, there is a potential opportunity to obtain tumor specimens in the form of multicellular spheroids (MCS) present in malignant effusion fluids. Our objective was to develop a short duration culture of MCS from ovarian cancer malignant effusions in conditions selected to support organoid growth and use them as a platform for empirical drug sensitivity testing.                In this study, malignant effusion specimens were collected from patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). MCS were recovered and subjected to culture conditions designed to support organoid growth. In a subset of specimens, RNA-sequencing was performed at two time points during the short-term culture to determine changes in transcriptome in response to culture conditions. Organoid induction was also characterized in these specimens using Ki67 staining and histologic analysis. Drug sensitivity testing was performed on all specimens.                Our model describes organoids formed within days of primary culture, which can recapitulate the histological features of malignant ascites fluid and can be expanded for at least 6 days. RNA-seq analysis of four patient specimens showed that within 6 days of culture, there was significant up-regulation of genes related to cellular proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and KRAS signaling pathways. Drug sensitivity testing identified several agents with therapeutic potential.                Short duration organoid culture of MCS from HGSOC malignant effusions can be used as a platform for empiric drug sensitivity testing. These ex vivo models may be helpful in screening new or existing therapeutic agents prior to individualized treatment options.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
31306552        	Vitamin D differentially regulates colon stem cells in patient-derived normal and tumor organoids.            	Intestine is a major target of vitamin D and several studies indicate an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but also increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and mortality. However, the putative effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), the active vitamin D metabolite, on human colonic stem cells are unknown. Here we show by immunohistochemistry and RNAscope in situ hybridization that vitamin D receptor (VDR) is unexpectedly expressed in LGR5+ colon stem cells in human tissue and in normal and tumor organoid cultures generated from patient biopsies. Interestingly, normal and tumor organoids respond differentially to calcitriol with profound and contrasting changes in their transcriptomic profiles. In normal organoids, calcitriol upregulates stemness-related genes, such as LGR5, SMOC2, LRIG1, MSI1, PTK7, and MEX3A, and inhibits cell proliferation. In contrast, in tumor organoids calcitriol has little effect on stemness-related genes while it induces a differentiated phenotype, and variably reduces cell proliferation. Concordantly, electron microscopy showed that calcitriol does not affect the blastic undifferentiated cell phenotype in normal organoids but it induces a series of differentiated features in tumor organoids. Our results constitute the first demonstration of a regulatory role of vitamin D on human colon stem cells, indicating a homeostatic effect on colon epithelium with relevant implications in IBD and CRC.                © 2019 The Authors.

31398570        	Mechanically and chemically defined hydrogel matrices for patient-derived colorectal tumor organoid culture.            	Patient-derived tumor organoids offer potentially useful models of cancer tissue physiology. Yet, conventional organoid cultures utilize generic matrices that are difficult to tailor for various unique tumor microenvironments. Here, we employ synthetic, enzymatically crosslinked hydrogels to define mechanical and biochemical properties hypothesized to be relevant for maintaining these organoids. We show that a single extracellular matrix component, gelatin, suffices to support colorectal cancer patient-derived xenograft (CRC-PDX) organoid survival, and that high matrix stiffness synergizes with hypoxia to increase organoid growth and metabolism in a majority of CRC-PDX lines tested. Moreover, we demonstrate that defined gelatin-based hydrogels support CRC-PDX tumor growth in vivo and organoid sensitivity to various CRC therapeutic drugs in vitro in a largely comparable fashion to a conventional reconstituted basement membrane matrix. Based on our findings, we propose that enzymatically crosslinked hydrogels potentially provide a platform for designing mechanically and biochemically defined matrices for various types of patient-derived tumor organoids.

33127883        	Network-based machine learning in colorectal and bladder organoid models predicts anti-cancer drug efficacy in patients.            	Cancer patient classification using predictive biomarkers for anti-cancer drug responses is essential for improving therapeutic outcomes. However, current machine-learning-based predictions of drug response often fail to identify robust translational biomarkers from preclinical models. Here, we present a machine-learning framework to identify robust drug biomarkers by taking advantage of network-based analyses using pharmacogenomic data derived from three-dimensional organoid culture models. The biomarkers identified by our approach accurately predict the drug responses of 114 colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil and 77 bladder cancer patients treated with cisplatin. We further confirm our biomarkers using external transcriptomic datasets of drug-sensitive and -resistant isogenic cancer cell lines. Finally, concordance analysis between the transcriptomic biomarkers and independent somatic mutation-based biomarkers further validate our method. This work presents a method to predict cancer patient drug responses using pharmacogenomic data derived from organoid models by combining the application of gene modules and network-based approaches.	
33046798        	Molecular biological analysis of 5-FU-resistant gastric cancer organoids; KHDRBS3 contributes to the attainment of features of cancer stem cell.            	5-FU is one of the key drugs in the treatment of gastric cancer (GC). Much evidence has shown that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a key role in the acquisition of drug resistance. The organoid is a novel 3D cell culture system technology that sustains stem-cell-driven formation of near-physiological, self-renewing tissues using specific niche factors in a dish. In this study, we established GC organoids (GCOs) and gradually treated them with higher concentrations of 5-FU. We successfully harvested four 5-FU-resistant GCOs, which were supported by significant changes in the expression of molecules related to 5-FU metabolism. We then performed microarray analysis using three normal gastric organoids and three pairs of 5-FU-resistant and parental GCOs. Through the comparison of expression profiles and further validation, we chose KHDRBS3 as a target gene. We found KHDRBS3 to be an independent prognostic factor in GC patients, especially in GC patients treated with 5-FU chemotherapy. We also determined that KHDRBS3 might play an important role in the acquisition of stem cell-like features, such as multi-drug resistance and organoid formation, by regulating CD44 variant expression. We found KHDRBS3, which is thought to play an important role in the acquisition of characteristics of CSCs in GC, to be a promising candidate marker for predicting therapeutic effect and prognosis in GC patients.	
32009247        	Stable expansion of high-grade serous ovarian cancer organoids requires a low-Wnt environment.            	High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) likely originates from the fallopian tube (FT) epithelium. Here, we established 15 organoid lines from HGSOC primary tumor deposits that closely match the mutational profile and phenotype of the parental tumor. We found that Wnt pathway activation leads to growth arrest of these cancer organoids. Moreover, active BMP signaling is almost always required for the generation of HGSOC organoids, while healthy fallopian tube organoids depend on BMP suppression by Noggin. Fallopian tube organoids modified by stable shRNA knockdown of p53, PTEN, and retinoblastoma protein (RB) also require a low-Wnt environment for long-term growth, while fallopian tube organoid medium triggers growth arrest. Thus, early changes in the stem cell niche environment are needed to support outgrowth of these genetically altered cells. Indeed, comparative analysis of gene expression pattern and phenotypes of normal vs. loss-of-function organoids confirmed that depletion of tumor suppressors triggers changes in the regulation of stemness and differentiation.                © 2020 The Authors.

30794801        	Engineered materials to model human intestinal development and cancer using organoids.            	Human organoids provide constructive in vitro models of human development and disease, as these recapitulate important morphogenetic and functional features of the tissue and species of origin. However, organoid culture technologies often involve the use of biologically-derived materials (e.g. Matrigel™) that do not allow dissection of the independent contributions of the biochemical and biophysical matrix properties to organoid development. Additionally, their inherent lot-to-lot variability and, in the case of Matrigel™, tumor-derived nature limits their applicability as platforms for drug and tissue transplantation therapies. Here, we highlight recent studies that overcome these limitations through engineering of novel biomaterial platforms that (1) allow to study the independent contributions of physicochemical matrix properties to organoid development and their potential for translational therapies, and (2) better recreate the tumor microenvironment for high-throughput, pre-clinical drug development. These studies illustrate how innovative biomaterial constructs can contribute to the modeling of human development and disease using organoids, and as platforms for development of organoid-based therapies. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of the organoid field and how they can potentially be addressed using engineered biomaterials.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

31678242        	Development of organoid-based drug metabolism model.            	Cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene superfamily catalyzes oxidative metabolism of a wide variety of drugs, carcinogens, and endogenous biomolecules in the liver and intestinal organs. In vitro assay platforms such as primary hepatocyte and immortalized liver-derived cell lines have been developed to evaluate drug effects. However, several limitations have been suggested regarding discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo assays. In this study, we aimed to investigate drug metabolism and toxicity based on mouse small intestinal and liver organoids derived from resident stem cells. At first, expressions and activities of CYP subfamilies (CYPs) in intestinal and liver organoids were investigated. Organoids treated with three CYPs-inducers dexamethasone (Dex), β-naphthoflavone (BNF), and 1,4-bis-2-(3, 5-dichloropyridyloxy)-benzene (TCPOBOP) were evaluated for CYPs activities. The CYPs-induced intestinal and liver organoids were confirmed to digest more docetaxel, as colon cancer cell-line survived more in CYPs-induced organoid's medium than in non-induced organoid's medium. Then, the activity of docetaxel in a co-culture platform of mouse liver organoids and human pancreatic tumoroids was measured. We obtained significant statistical values on CYPs-induced metabolic activities: cell survival rates of pancreatic tumoroids co-cultured with docetaxel-treated undifferentiated, differentiated, and CYPs-induced differentiated organoids were 66.05 ± 2.14%, 89.20 ± 2.67%, and 101.90 ± 0.94%, respectively. To sum up, gene expression modification and drug metabolism evaluation were able to be done with organoids as done with tissues. In vivo-like in vitro investigation on drug toxicity may potentially be done with organoids as a stepping bridge to the clinical trial.                Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.	
31197820        	Organoids from colorectal peritoneal metastases as a platform for improving hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.            	Patients with peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer have a poor prognosis. If the intraperitoneal tumour load is limited, patients may be eligible for cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). This treatment has improved overall survival, but recurrence rates are high. The aim of this study was to create a preclinical platform for the development of more effective intraperitoneal chemotherapy strategies.                Using organoid technology, five tumour cultures were generated from malignant ascites and resected peritoneal metastases. These were used in an in vitro HIPEC model to assess sensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC) and oxaliplatin, the drugs used most commonly in HIPEC. The model was also used to test a rational combination treatment involving MMC and inhibitors of the checkpoint kinase ATR.                MMC was more effective in eliminating peritoneal metastasis-derived organoids than oxaliplatin at clinically relevant concentrations. However, the drug concentrations required to eliminate 50 per cent of the tumour cells (IC50) were higher than the median clinical dose in two of five organoid lines for MMC, and all five lines for oxaliplatin, indicating a general resistance to monotherapy. ATR inhibition increased the sensitivity of all peritoneal metastasis-derived organoids to MMC, as the IC50 decreased 2·6-12·4-fold to well below concentrations commonly attained in clinical practice. Live-cell imaging and flow cytometric analysis showed that ATR inhibition did not release cells from MMC-induced cell cycle arrest, but caused increased replication stress and accelerated cell death.                Peritoneal metastasis-derived organoids can be used to evaluate existing HIPEC regimens on an individual-patient level and for development of more effective treatment strategies. Surgical relevance Cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has improved prognosis of patients with peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer, but disease recurrence is common. More effective and personalized HIPEC is urgently needed. Organoid technology is frequently used for drug screens, as patient-derived organoids can accurately predict clinical therapeutic response in vitro. A panel of organoids was established from peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer and used to develop a model for testing HIPEC regimens in vitro. Patient-derived organoids differed in sensitivity to commonly used chemotherapeutics, in line with variable clinical outcomes following cytoreductive surgery-HIPEC. Combining MMC with an ATR inhibitor improved the efficacy of MMC. Peritoneal metastasis-derived organoids can be used as a platform to test novel (combination) strategies that increase HIPEC efficacy. In the future, organoids could be used to select patent-tailored HIPEC regimens.                © 2019 The Authors. BJS published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of BJS Society Ltd.	
32810173        	3D imaging of colorectal cancer organoids identifies responses to Tankyrase inhibitors.            	Aberrant activation of the Wnt signalling pathway is required for tumour initiation and survival in the majority of colorectal cancers. The development of inhibitors of Wnt signalling has been the focus of multiple drug discovery programs targeting colorectal cancer and other malignancies associated with aberrant pathway activation. However, progression of new clinical entities targeting the Wnt pathway has been slow. One challenge lies with the limited predictive power of 2D cancer cell lines because they fail to fully recapitulate intratumoural phenotypic heterogeneity. In particular, the relationship between 2D cancer cell biology and cancer stem cell function is poorly understood. By contrast, 3D tumour organoids provide a platform in which complex cell-cell interactions can be studied. However, complex 3D models provide a challenging platform for the quantitative analysis of drug responses of therapies that have differential effects on tumour cell subpopulations. Here, we generated tumour organoids from colorectal cancer patients and tested their responses to inhibitors of Tankyrase (TNKSi) which are known to modulate Wnt signalling. Using compounds with 3 orders of magnitude difference in cellular mechanistic potency together with image-based assays, we demonstrate that morphometric analyses can capture subtle alterations in organoid responses to Wnt inhibitors that are consistent with activity against a cancer stem cell subpopulation. Overall our study highlights the value of phenotypic readouts as a quantitative method to asses drug-induced effects in a relevant preclinical model.	
31028424        	Extracellular vesicle release from intestinal organoids is modulated by Apc mutation and other colorectal cancer progression factors.            	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-surrounded structures that transmit biologically important molecules from the releasing to target cells, thus providing a novel intercellular communication mechanism. Since EVs carry their cargo in a protected form and their secretion is generally increased in tumorigenesis, EVs hold a great potential for early cancer diagnosis. By 3D culturing, we provide evidence that colorectal cancer (CRC) patient-derived organoids, representing a state-of-the-art established and essential approach for studying human CRC, is a suitable model for EV analysis. When testing the effects of major factors promoting CRC progression on EV release in the organoid model, we observed that Apc mutation, leading to uncontrolled Wnt activation and thus to tumorigenesis in the vast majority in CRC patients, critically induces EV release by activating the Wnt pathway. Furthermore, the extracellular matrix component collagen, known to accumulate in tumorigenesis, enhances EV secretion as well. Importantly, we show that fibroblast-derived EVs induce colony formation of CRC organoid cells under hypoxia. In contrast, there was no major effect of tumor cell-derived EVs on the activation of fibroblasts. Collectively, our results with CRC and Apc-mutant adenoma organoids identify Apc mutation and collagen deposition as critical factors for increasing EV release from tumors. Furthermore, we provide evidence that stromal fibroblast-derived EVs contribute to tumorigenesis under unfavorable conditions in CRC.	
31622618        	Chromosome Engineering of Human Colon-Derived Organoids to Develop a Model of Traditional Serrated Adenoma.            	Traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) are rare colorectal polyps with unique histologic features. Fusions in R-spondin genes have been found in TSAs, but it is not clear whether these are sufficient for TSA development, due to the lack of a chromosome engineering platform for human tissues. We studied the effects of fusions in R-spondin genes and other genetic alterations found in TSA using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated chromosome and genetic modification of human colonic organoids.                We introduced chromosome rearrangements that involve R-spondin genes into human colonic organoids, with or without disruption of TP53, using CRISPR-Cas9 (chromosome-engineered organoids). We then knocked a mutation into BRAF encoding the V600E substitution and overexpressed the GREM1 transgene; the organoids were transplanted into colons of NOG mice and growth of xenograft tumors was measured. Colon tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization. We also established 2 patient-derived TSA organoid lines and characterized their genetic features and phenotypes. We inserted a bicistronic cassette expressing a dimerizer-inducible suicide gene and fluorescent marker downstream of the LGR5 gene in the chromosome-engineered organoids; addition of the dimerizer eradicates LGR5+ cells. Some tumor-bearing mice were given intraperitoneal injections of the dimerizer to remove LGR5-expressing cells.                Chromosome engineering of organoids required disruption of TP53 or culture in medium containing IGF1 and FGF2. In colons of mice, organoids that expressed BRAFV600E and fusions in R-spondin genes formed flat serrated lesions. Patient-derived TSA organoids grew independent of exogenous R-spondin, and 1 line grew independent of Noggin. Organoids that overexpressed GREM1, in addition to BRAFV600E and fusions in R-spondin genes, formed polypoid tumors in mice that had histologic features similar to TSAs. Xenograft tumors persisted after loss of LGR5-expressing cells.                We demonstrated efficient chromosomal engineering of human normal colon organoids. We introduced genetic and chromosome alterations into human colon organoids found in human TSAs; tumors grown from these organoids in mice had histopathology features of TSAs. This model might be used to study progression of human colorectal tumors with RSPO fusion gene and GREM1 overexpression.                Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

31036555        	3D model for CAR-mediated cytotoxicity using patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids.            	Immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered lymphocytes has shown impressive results in leukemia. However, for solid tumors such as colorectal cancer (CRC), new preclinical models are needed that allow to test CAR-mediated cytotoxicity in a tissue-like environment. Here, we developed a platform to study CAR cell cytotoxicity against 3-dimensional (3D) patient-derived colon organoids. Luciferase-based measurement served as a quantitative read-out for target cell viability. Additionally, we set up a confocal live imaging protocol to monitor effector cell recruitment and cytolytic activity at a single organoid level. As proof of principle, we demonstrated efficient targeting in diverse organoid models using CAR-engineered NK-92 cells directed toward a ubiquitous epithelial antigen (EPCAM). Tumor antigen-specific cytotoxicity was studied with CAR-NK-92 cells targeting organoids expressing EGFRvIII, a neoantigen found in several cancers. Finally, we tested a novel CAR strategy targeting FRIZZLED receptors that show increased expression in a subgroup of CRC tumors. Here, comparative killing assays with normal organoids failed to show tumor-specific activity. Taken together, we report a sensitive in vitro platform to evaluate CAR efficacy and tumor specificity in a personalized manner.                © 2019 The Authors.	
31018139        	Establishment of Patient-Derived Organoids and Drug Screening for Biliary Tract Carcinoma.            	Biliary tract carcinomas (BTCs) are among the most aggressive malignancies and have a poor prognosis. Here, we successfully established organoid lines derived from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. These organoids derived from BTCs were cultured stably for >1 year and closely recapitulated the histopathology, gene expression, and genetic alterations evident in the primary tumors. Gene expression profiling of the organoids revealed that SOX2 could be a potential prognostic biomarker for patients with BTC. We screened a compound library consisting of drugs used clinically for their ability to suppress organoids derived from BTCs and found that the antifungal drugs amorolfine and fenticonazole significantly suppressed the growth of organoids derived from BTCs with minimal toxicity to normal biliary epithelial cells. Patient-derived organoids may be a powerful research tool for the clarification of molecular pathogenesis and the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic drugs for refractory cancers.

30626705        	Breast tumour organoids: promising models for the genomic and functional characterisation of breast cancer.            	Until recently, established cancer cell lines have been used extensively in breast cancer research, due largely to the difficulties associated with the manipulation and long-term maintenance in culture of primary tumour cells from patients. The recent development of organoid cultures has provided new opportunities to model and analyse patient samples, allowing the propagation of malignant cells under conditions that resemble the three-dimensional growth of breast tumours. They have proved efficacious in preserving the heterogeneity of primary samples and are emerging as a new model to further characterise the molecular features of breast cancer. Organoids formed from patient-derived cells are now in use for the evaluation of drug sensitivity and to validate disease-causing genomic variations. Here, the advantages and limitations of organoid cultures will be discussed and compared with the parallel development of other two- and three-dimensional culture strategies and with patient-derived xenografts. In particular, we will focus on the molecular characterisation of breast cancer organoids and provide some examples of how they have been used in functional studies.                © 2019 The Author(s).

31598791        	Malignant ascites-derived organoid (MADO) cultures for gastric cancer in vitro modelling and drug screening.            	Malignant ascites (MA) is a common manifestation in advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and usually indicates a poor prognosis. However, lack of in vitro models that can faithfully recapitulate the characteristics of tumour cells in ascites hinders related researches. Tumour organoids have emerged as a robust in vitro model for tumour research and drug screening. Hence, we aimed to generate a 3-D in vitro organoid cultures from malignant ascites of gastric cancer for disease modelling and drug screening.                Eleven MADOs were generated from the MA tumour cells of gastric cancer patients. We made comparisons between MADOs and original MA tumour cells in histopathology by immunohistochemistry and genomics by whole-exome sequencing. In order to evaluate MADOs as functional in vitro disease models, we tested whether MADOs could be used for drug sensitivity screens.                Eleven MADO cultures from human gastric cancer were established. MADOs demonstrated divergent growth characteristics and morphologies. MADO cultures preserve the histological architecture, genomic landscape of the corresponding MA tumour cells. MADOs exhibited heterogeneous responses to standard-of-care chemotherapeutics.                We generated MADOs modelling characteristics and mutated genes of MA tumour cells. A broad range of intrinsic MADO response to conventional chemotherapeutics suggests MADOs are amenable to drug screening.	
32531849        	Mouse parotid salivary gland organoids for the in vitro study of stem cell radiation response.            	Hyposalivation-related xerostomia is an irreversible, untreatable, and frequent condition after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Stem cell therapy is an attractive option of treatment, but demands knowledge of stem cell functioning. Therefore, we aimed to develop a murine parotid gland organoid model to explore radiation response of stem cells in vitro.                Single cells derived from murine parotid gland organoids were passaged in Matrigel with defined medium to assess self-renewal and differentiation potential. Single cells were irradiated and plated in a 3D clonogenic stem cell survival assay to assess submandibular and parotid gland radiation response.                Single cells derived from parotid gland organoids were able to extensively self-renew and differentiate into all major tissue cell types, indicating the presence of potential stem cells. FACS selection for known salivary gland stem cell markers CD24/CD29 did not further enrich for stem cells. The parotid gland organoid-derived stem cells displayed radiation dose-response curves similar to the submandibular gland.                Murine parotid gland organoids harbor stem cells with long-term expansion and differentiation potential. This model is useful for mechanistic studies of stem cell radiation response and suggests similar radiosensitivity for the parotid and submandibular gland organoids.                © 2020 The Authors.

31771627        	BRCA1 mutation influences progesterone response in human benign mammary organoids.            	Women, who carry a germline BRCA1 gene mutation, have a markedly increased risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetime. While BRCA1 carriers frequently develop triple-negative, basal-like, aggressive breast tumors, hormone signaling is important in the genesis of BRCA1 mutant breast cancers. We investigated the hormone response in BRCA1-mutated benign breast tissue using an in vitro organoid system.                Scaffold-free, multicellular human breast organoids generated from benign breast tissues from non-carrier or BRCA1 mutation carriers were treated in vitro with a stepwise menstrual cycle hormone regimen of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) over the course of 28 days.                Breast organoids exhibited characteristics of the native breast tissue, including expression of hormone receptors, collagen production, and markers of luminal and basal epithelium, and stromal fibroblasts. RNA sequencing analysis revealed distinct gene expression in response to hormone treatment in the non-carrier and BRCA1-mutated organoids. The selective progesterone receptor modulator, telapristone acetate (TPA), was used to identify specifically PR regulated genes. Specifically, extracellular matrix organization genes were regulated by E2+P4+TPA in the BRCA1-mutated organoids but not in the non-carrier organoids. In contrast, in the non-carrier organoids, known PR target genes such as the cell cycle genes were inhibited by TPA.                These data show that BRCA1 mutation influences hormone response and in particular PR activity which differs from that of non-carrier organoids. Our organoid model system revealed important insights into the role of PR in BRCA1-mutated benign breast cells and the critical paracrine actions that modify hormone receptor (HR)-negative cells. Further analysis of the molecular mechanism of BRCA1 and PR crosstalk is warranted using this model system.	
31053628        	Oral Mucosal Organoids as a Potential Platform for Personalized Cancer Therapy.            	Previous studies have described that tumor organoids can capture the diversity of defined human carcinoma types. Here, we describe conditions for long-term culture of human mucosal organoids. Using this protocol, a panel of 31 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)-derived organoid lines was established. This panel recapitulates genetic and molecular characteristics previously described for HNSCC. Organoids retain their tumorigenic potential upon xenotransplantation. We observe differential responses to a panel of drugs including cisplatin, carboplatin, cetuximab, and radiotherapy in vitro. Additionally, drug screens reveal selective sensitivity to targeted drugs that are not normally used in the treatment of patients with HNSCC. These observations may inspire a personalized approach to the management of HNSCC and expand the repertoire of HNSCC drugs. SIGNIFICANCE: This work describes the culture of organoids derived from HNSCC and corresponding normal epithelium. These tumoroids recapitulate the disease genetically, histologically, and functionally. In vitro drug screening of tumoroids reveals responses to therapies both currently used in the treatment of HNSCC and those not (yet) used in clinical practice.See related commentary by Hill and D'Andrea, p. 828.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 813.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
29748182        	A PDX/Organoid Biobank of Advanced Prostate Cancers Captures Genomic and Phenotypic Heterogeneity for Disease Modeling and Therapeutic Screening.            	Purpose: Prostate cancer translational research has been hampered by the lack of comprehensive and tractable models that represent the genomic landscape of clinical disease. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) recapitulate the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the disease. We sought to establish a representative, preclinical platform of PDX-derived organoids that is experimentally facile for high-throughput and mechanistic analysis.Experimental Design: Using 20 models from the LuCaP mCRPC PDX cohort, including adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine lineages, we systematically tested >20 modifications to prostate organoid conditions. Organoids were evaluated for genomic and phenotypic stability and continued reliance on the AR signaling pathway. The utility of the platform as a genotype-dependent model of drug sensitivity was tested with olaparib and carboplatin.Results: All PDX models proliferated as organoids in culture. Greater than 50% could be continuously cultured long-term in modified conditions; however, none of the PDXs could be established long-term as organoids under previously reported conditions. In addition, the modified conditions improved the establishment of patient biopsies over current methods. The genomic heterogeneity of the PDXs was conserved in organoids. Lineage markers and transcriptomes were maintained between PDXs and organoids. Dependence on AR signaling was preserved in adenocarcinoma organoids, replicating a dominant characteristic of CRPC. Finally, we observed maximum cytotoxicity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib in BRCA2-/- organoids, similar to responses observed in patients.Conclusions: The LuCaP PDX/organoid models provide an expansive, genetically characterized platform to investigate the mechanisms of pathogenesis as well as therapeutic responses and their molecular correlates in mCRPC.

26460009        	Preserved genetic diversity in organoids cultured from biopsies of human colorectal cancer metastases.            	Tumor organoids are 3D cultures of cancer cells. They can be derived from the tumor of each individual patient, thereby providing an attractive ex vivo assay to tailor treatment. Using patient-derived tumor organoids for this purpose requires that organoids derived from biopsies maintain the genetic diversity of the in vivo tumor. In this study tumor biopsies were obtained from 14 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (i) to test the feasibility of organoid culture from metastatic biopsy specimens and (ii) to compare the genetic diversity of patient-derived tumor organoids and the original tumor biopsy. Genetic analysis was performed using SOLiD sequencing for 1,977 cancer-relevant genes. Copy number profiles were generated from sequencing data using CopywriteR. Here we demonstrate that organoid cultures can be established from tumor biopsies of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a success rate of 71%. Genetic analysis showed that organoids reflect the metastasis from which they were derived. Ninety percent of somatic mutations were shared between organoids and biopsies from the same patient, and the DNA copy number profiles of organoids and the corresponding original tumor show a correlation of 0.89. Most importantly, none of the mutations that were found exclusively in either the tumor or organoid culture are in driver genes or genes amenable for drug targeting. These findings support further exploration of patient-derived organoids as an ex vivo platform to personalize anticancer treatment.	
32349587        	Comparison of Cell and Organoid-Level Analysis of Patient-Derived 3D Organoids to Evaluate Tumor Cell Growth Dynamics and Drug Response.            	3D cell culture models have been developed to better mimic the physiological environments that exist in human diseases. As such, these models are advantageous over traditional 2D cultures for screening drug compounds. However, the practicalities of transitioning from 2D to 3D drug treatment studies pose challenges with respect to analysis methods. Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) possess unique features given their heterogeneity in size, shape, and growth patterns. A detailed assessment of the length scale at which PDTOs should be evaluated (i.e., individual cell or organoid-level analysis) has not been done to our knowledge. Therefore, using dynamic confocal live cell imaging and data analysis methods we examined tumor cell growth rates and drug response behaviors in colorectal cancer (CRC) PDTOs. High-resolution imaging of H2B-GFP-labeled organoids with DRAQ7 vital dye permitted tracking of cellular changes, such as cell birth and death events, in individual organoids. From these same images, we measured morphological features of the 3D objects, including volume, sphericity, and ellipticity. Sphericity and ellipticity were used to evaluate intra- and interpatient tumor organoid heterogeneity. We found a strong correlation between organoid live cell number and volume. Linear growth rate calculations based on volume or live cell counts were used to determine differential responses to therapeutic interventions. We showed that this approach can detect different types of drug effects (cytotoxic vs cytostatic) in PDTO cultures. Overall, our imaging-based quantification workflow results in multiple parameters that can provide patient- and drug-specific information for screening applications.	
31614364        	Scaffold-Free Endometrial Organoids Respond to Excess Androgens Associated With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.            	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent disorder in reproductive aged women associated with a number of endocrine and metabolic complications, including increased risk of endometrial cancer.                To study the effect of the characteristic increased androgen levels in PCOS on the endometrium, a novel scaffold-free multicellular endometrial organoid was established.                Human endometrial organoids were constructed using primary endometrial epithelial and stromal cells from endometrial tissues. Organoids were treated for 14 days with physiologic levels of estradiol and testosterone to mimic a normal follicular phase or PCOS hormone profiles. Organoids were harvested for immunostaining and ribonucleic acid sequencing.                Academic institution.                Endometrial tissues from 10 premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for benign pathologies were obtained following written consent.                Organoid architecture, cell specific markers, functional markers, proliferation, and gene expression were measured.                A method to generate scaffold-free endometrial organoids containing epithelial and stromal cells was established. These organoids exhibited distinct organization with epithelial cells lining the outer surface and stromal cells in the center of the organoids. Epithelial cells were polarized, organoids expressed cell type specific and functional markers, as well as androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors. Treatment with PCOS hormones increased cell proliferation and dysregulated genes in endometrial organoids.                A new multicellular, scaffold-free endometrial organoid system was established that resembled physiology of the native endometrium. Excess androgens in PCOS promoted cell proliferation in endometrial organoids, revealing new mechanisms of PCOS-associated with risk of endometrial neoplasia.                © Endocrine Society 2019.

33047901        	Generation and initial characterization of novel tumour organoid models to study human pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia.            	The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer develops cachexia. The mechanisms underlying cancer cachexia development and progression remain elusive, although tumour-derived factors are considered to play a major role. Pancreatic tumour organoids are in vitro three-dimensional organ-like structures that retain many pathophysiological characteristics of the in vivo tumour. We aimed to establish a pancreatic tumour organoid biobank from well-phenotyped cachectic and non-cachectic patients to enable identification of tumour-derived factors driving cancer cachexia.                Organoids were generated from tumour tissue of eight pancreatic cancer patients. A comprehensive pre-operative patient assessment of cachexia-related parameters including nutritional status, physical performance, body composition, and inflammation was performed. Tumour-related and cachexia-related characteristics of the organoids were analysed using histological stainings, targeted sequencing, and real-time-quantitative PCR. Cachexia-related factors present in the circulation of the patients and in the tumour organoid secretome were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.                The established human pancreatic tumour organoids presented typical features of malignancy corresponding to the primary tumour (i.e. nuclear enlargement, multiple nucleoli, mitosis, apoptosis, and mutated KRAS and/or TP53). These tumour organoids also expressed variable levels of many known cachexia-related genes including interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1α, IL-1β, Mcp-1, GDF15, and LIF. mRNA expression of IL-1α and IL-1β was significantly reduced in organoids from cachectic vs. non-cachectic patients (IL-1α: -3.8-fold, P = 0.009, and IL-1β: -4.7-fold, P = 0.004). LIF, IL-8, and GDF15 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in organoids from cachectic vs. non-cachectic patients (LIF: 1.6-fold, P = 0.003; IL-8: 1.4-fold, P = 0.01; GDF15: 2.3-fold, P < 0.001). In line with the GDF15 and IL-8 mRNA expression levels, tumour organoids from cachectic patients secreted more GDF15 and IL-8 compared with organoids from non-cachectic patients (5.4 vs. 1.5 ng/mL, P = 0.01, and 7.4 vs. 1.3 ng/mL, P = 0.07, respectively).                This novel human pancreatic tumour organoid biobank provides a valuable tool to increase our understanding of the mechanisms driving cancer cachexia. Our preliminary characterization of the secretome of these organoids supports their application in functional studies including conditioned medium approaches and in vivo transplantation models.                © 2020 The Authors.

30788830        	An Organoid Assay for Long-Term Maintenance and Propagation of Mouse Prostate Luminal Epithelial Progenitors and Cancer Cells.            	Historically, prostate luminal epithelial progenitors and cancer cells have been difficult to culture, thus hampering the generation of representative models for the study of prostate homeostasis, epithelial lineage hierarchy relationship and cancer drug efficacy assessment. Here, we describe a newly developed culture methodology that can efficiently grow prostate luminal epithelial progenitors and cancer cells as organoids. Notably, the organoid assay favors prostate luminal cell growth, thus minimizing basal cell dominance upon the establishment and continuous propagation of prostate epithelial cells. Importantly, organoids cultured under this condition have demonstrated preservation of androgen responsiveness and intact androgen receptor signaling, providing a representative system to study castration resistance and androgen receptor independence.	
31758153        	FGF Signalling in the Self-Renewal of Colon Cancer Organoids.            	The progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) is supposedly driven by cancer stem cells (CSC) which are able to self-renew and simultaneously fuel bulk tumour mass with highly proliferative and differentiated tumour cells. However, the CSC-phenotype in CRC is unstable and dependent on environmental cues. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is essential and necessary for the maintenance of self-renewal in adult and embryonic stem cells. Investigating its role in self-renewal in advanced CRC patient-derived organoids, we unveiled that FGF-receptor (FGFR) inhibition prevents organoid formation in very early expanding cells but induces cyst formation when applied to pre-established organoids. Comprehensive transcriptome analyses revealed that the induction of the transcription factor activator-protein-1 (AP-1) together with MAPK activation was most prominent after FGFR-inhibition. These effects resemble mechanisms of an acquired resistance against other described tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as EGF-receptor targeted therapies. Furthermore, we detected elevated expression levels of several self-renewal and stemness-associated genes in organoid cultures with active FGF2 signalling. The combined data assume that CSCs are a heterogeneous population while self-renewal is a common feature regulated by distinct but converging pathways. Finally, we highlight FGF2 signalling as one of numerous components of the complex regulation of stemness in cancer.	
31591597        	A rectal cancer organoid platform to study individual responses to chemoradiation.            	Rectal cancer (RC) is a challenging disease to treat that requires chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to optimize outcomes for individual patients. No accurate model of RC exists to answer fundamental research questions relevant to patients. We established a biorepository of 65 patient-derived RC organoid cultures (tumoroids) from patients with primary, metastatic or recurrent disease. RC tumoroids retained molecular features of the tumors from which they were derived, and their ex vivo responses to clinically relevant chemotherapy and radiation treatment correlated with the clinical responses noted in individual patients' tumors. Upon engraftment into murine rectal mucosa, human RC tumoroids gave rise to invasive RC followed by metastasis to lung and liver. Importantly, engrafted tumors displayed the heterogenous sensitivity to chemotherapy observed clinically. Thus, the biology and drug sensitivity of RC clinical isolates can be efficiently interrogated using an organoid-based, ex vivo platform coupled with in vivo endoluminal propagation in animals.	
30814510        	Organoids as a new model for improving regenerative medicine and cancer personalized therapy in renal diseases.            	The pressure towards innovation and creation of new model systems in regenerative medicine and cancer research has fostered the development of novel potential therapeutic applications. Kidney injuries provoke a high request of organ transplants making it the most demanding system in the field of regenerative medicine. Furthermore, renal cancer frequently threaten patients' life and aggressive forms still remain difficult to treat. Ethical issues related to the use of embryonic stem cells, has fueled research on adult, patient-specific pluripotent stem cells as a model for discovery and therapeutic development, but to date, normal and cancerous renal experimental models are lacking. Several research groups are focusing on the development of organoid cultures. Since organoids mimic the original tissue architecture in vitro, they represent an excellent model for tissue engineering studies and cancer therapy testing. We established normal and tumor renal cell carcinoma organoids previously maintained in a heterogeneous multi-clone stem cell-like enriching medium. Starting from adult normal kidney specimens, we were able to isolate and propagate organoid 3D-structures composed of both differentiated and undifferentiated cells while expressing nephron specific markers. Furthermore, we were capable to establish organoids derived from cancer tissues although with a success rate inferior to that of their normal counterpart. Cancer cultures displayed epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype while retaining tumor specific markers. Of note, tumor organoids recapitulated neoplastic masses when orthotopically injected into immunocompromised mice. Our data suggest an innovative approach of long-term establishment of normal- and cancer-derived renal organoids obtained from cultures of fleshly dissociated adult tissues. Our results pave the way to organ replacement pioneering strategies as well as to new models for studying drug-induced nephrotoxicity and renal diseases. Along similar lines, deriving organoids from renal cancer patients opens unprecedented opportunities for generation of preclinical models aimed at improving therapeutic treatments.	
30506544        	[Establishment and application of gastric and gastric cancer organoids].            	Gastric organoid is the organotypic cultures of gastric stem cells or pluripotent stem cells. Gastric organoid is comprised of all major types of gastric epithelial cells and represent the architecture and function remarkably similar to those of the gastric epithelium, faithfully recapitulating the functional gastric epithelium ex vivo. As ideal basic experimental model, gastric organoid has advantages over animal models and conventional cell model in many aspects. Gastric organoid derived from human gastric tissue, in particular, allows the investigation of the function of human stomach in the ex vivo setting. It has now been applied in the field of formation and physiology of the stomach, Helicobacter pylori infection-associated diseases, research of the pathogenic gene, screening and development of drugs, and regenerative medicine. What is more, as an innovative pre-clinical cancer model, gastric cancer organoid has provided important insights in the development of gastric cancer and screening of antitumor drugs, such as simulating the occurrence and development of gastric cancer, screening and development of antitumor drugs, personalized medication and targeted therapy for gastric cancer, and combined application with patient-derived xenograft. In this review, we summarize the establishment and application of gastric and gastric cancer organoids, especially in modeling gastric cancer, basic research and drug development.	
28534535        	The potential of organoids in urological cancer research.            	Technical advances in the development of organoid systems enable cell lines, primary adult cells, or stem or progenitor cells to develop into diverse, multicellular entities, which can self-renew, self-organize, and differentiate. These 3D organoid cultures have proven to be of value in increasing our understanding of the biology of disease and offer the potential of regenerative and genetic therapies. The successful application of 3D organoids derived from adult tissue into urological cancer research can further our understanding of these diseases and could also provide preclinical cancer models to realize the precision medicine paradigm by therapeutic screening of individual patient samples ex vivo. Kidney organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells provide personalized biomarkers, which can be correlated with genetic and clinical information. Organoid models can also improve our comprehension of aspects of particular diseases; for example, in prostate cancer, 3D organoids can aid in the identification of tumour-initiating cells from an epithelial cell lineage. Furthermore, kidney organoid differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells enables gene editing to model disease in kidney tubular epithelial cells. State-of-the-art human organoid cultures have potential as tools in basic and clinical research in renal, bladder, and prostatic diseases.	
32112908        	Organoids to study immune functions, immunological diseases and immunotherapy.            	Three-dimensional organoid culture systems show great promise as innovative physiological and pathophysiological models. Their applications in immunological research have been widely explored. For instance, immune organoids allow functional studies of immune system-related conditions, in a context that closely mimics the in vivo microenvironment, enabling an in-depth understanding of the immune tissue structures and functions. The newly developed coculture organoid and the air-liquid interface (ALI) systems also provided new insights for studying epithelia-immune cell interactions based on their endogenous distribution. Additionally, organoids have enabled the innovation of immunological disease models and exploration of the link between immunity and cancer, showing potential for personalized immunotherapy. This review is an overview of recent advances in the application of organoids in immunological research. Furthermore, the potential improvements for further utilization of organoids in personalized immunotherapy are discussed.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
29256493        	BRCA-deficient mouse mammary tumor organoids to study cancer-drug resistance.            	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition (PARPi) is a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancers that show homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Despite the success of PARPi in targeting HRD in tumors that lack the tumor suppressor function of BRCA1 or BRCA2, drug resistance poses a major obstacle. We developed three-dimensional cancer organoids derived from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cancers. Unlike conventional cell lines or mammospheres, organoid cultures can be efficiently derived and rapidly expanded in vitro. Orthotopically transplanted organoids give rise to mammary tumors that recapitulate the epithelial morphology and preserve the drug response of the original tumor. Notably, GEMM-tumor-derived organoids can be easily genetically modified, making them a powerful tool for genetic studies of tumor biology and drug resistance.	
29414601        	Colorectal cancer liver metastases organoids retain characteristics of original tumor and acquire chemotherapy resistance.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis is highly unfavorable for patient outcome and is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Pre-clinical research of CRC liver metastasis predominately utilizes CRC cell lines grown in tissue culture. Here, we demonstrate that CRC liver metastases organoids derived from human specimens recapitulate some aspects of human disease.                Human CRC liver metastases pathological specimens were obtained following patient consent. Tumor disaggregates were plated and organoids were allowed to expand. CRC markers were identified by immunofluorescence. Stem cell genes were analysed by QPCR and flow cytometry. Response to drug therapy was quantified using time-lapse imaging and MATLAB analysis.                Organoids showed global expression of the epithelial marker, EpCAM and the adenocarcinoma marker, CEA CAM1. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that organoids express the stem cell surface markers CD24 and CD44. Finally, we demonstrated that CRC liver metastases organoids acquire chemotherapy resistance and can be utilized as surrogates for drug testing.                These data demonstrate that CRC liver metastases organoids recapitulate some aspects of human disease and may provide an invaluable resource for investigating novel drug therapies, chemotherapy resistance and mechanism of metastasis.

30440885        	Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Heterogeneity and Drug Response of Human Colorectal Cancer Organoids.            	Organoids are three-dimensional cell cultures that mimic organ functions and structures. The organoid model has been developed as a versatile in vitro platform for stem cell biology and diseases modeling. Tumor organoids are shown to share ~ 90% of genetic mutations with biopsies from same patients. However, it's not clear whether tumor organoids recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity observed in patient tumors. Here, we used single-cell RNA-Seq to investigate the transcriptomics of tumor organoids derived from human colorectal tumors, and applied machine learning methods to unbiasedly cluster subtypes in tumor organoids. Computational analysis reveals cancer heterogeneity sustained in tumor organoids, and the subtypes in organoids displayed high diversity. Furthermore, we treated the tumor organoids with a first-line cancer drug, Oxaliplatin, and investigated drug response in single-cell scale. Diversity of tumor cell populations in organoids were significantly perturbed by drug treatment. Single-cell analysis detected the depletion of chemosensitive subgroups and emergence of new drug tolerant subgroups after drug treatment. Our study suggests that the organoid model is capable of recapitulating clinical heterogeneity and its evolution in response to chemotherapy.	
29470983        	Development of a functional thyroid model based on an organoid culture system.            	The low turnover rate of thyroid follicular cells and the lack of a long-term thyroid cell culture system have hampered studies of thyroid carcinogenesis. We have now established a thyroid organoid culture system that supports thyroid cell proliferation in vitro. The established mouse thyroid organoids performed thyroid functions including thyroglobulin synthesis, iodide uptake, and the production and release of thyroid hormone. Furthermore, transplantation of the organoids into recipient mice resulted in the formation of normal thyroid-like tissue capable of iodide uptake and thyroglobulin production in vivo. Finally, forced expression of oncogenic NRAS (NRASQ61R) in thyroid organoids established from p53 knockout mice and transplantation of the manipulated organoids into mouse recipients generated a model of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. Our findings suggest that this newly developed thyroid organoid culture system is a potential research tool for the study of thyroid physiology and pathology including thyroid cancer.

30643021        	Long-term expanding human airway organoids for disease modeling.            	Organoids are self-organizing 3D structures grown from stem cells that recapitulate essential aspects of organ structure and function. Here, we describe a method to establish long-term-expanding human airway organoids from broncho-alveolar resections or lavage material. The pseudostratified airway organoids consist of basal cells, functional multi-ciliated cells, mucus-producing secretory cells, and CC10-secreting club cells. Airway organoids derived from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients allow assessment of CFTR function in an organoid swelling assay. Organoids established from lung cancer resections and metastasis biopsies retain tumor histopathology as well as cancer gene mutations and are amenable to drug screening. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection recapitulates central disease features, dramatically increases organoid cell motility via the non-structural viral NS2 protein, and preferentially recruits neutrophils upon co-culturing. We conclude that human airway organoids represent versatile models for the in vitro study of hereditary, malignant, and infectious pulmonary disease.                © 2019 The Authors.

32868555        	Organoid Models of Colorectal Pathology: Do They Hold the Key to Personalized Medicine? A Systematic Review.            	Colorectal cancer and IBD account for a large portion of the practice of colorectal surgery. Historical research models have provided insights into the underlying causes of these diseases but come with many limitations.                The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding the advantage of organoid models in modeling benign and malignant colorectal pathology.                Sources included PubMed, Ovid-Medline, and Ovid Embase STUDY SELECTION:: Two reviewers completed a systematic review of the literature between January 2006 and January of 2020 for studies related to colon and intestinal organoids. Reviews, commentaries, protocols, and studies not performed in humans or mice were excluded.                A total of 73 articles were included. Organoid models of colorectal disease have been rising in popularity to further elucidate the genetic, transcriptomic, and treatment response of these diseases at the individual level. Increasingly complex models utilizing coculture techniques are being rapidly developed that allow in vitro recapitulation of the disease microenvironment.                This review is only qualitative, and the lack of well utilized nomenclature in the organoid community may have resulted in the exclusion of articles.                Historical disease models including cell lines, patient-derived tumor xenografts, and animal models have created a strong foundation for our understanding of colorectal pathology. Recent advances in 3-dimensional cell cultures, in the form of patient-derived epithelial organoids and induced human intestinal organoids have opened a new avenue for high-resolution analysis of pathology at the level of an individual patient. Recent research has shown the potential of organoids as a tool for personalized medicine with their ability to retain patient characteristics, including treatment response.	
32514094        	High-throughput automated organoid culture via stem-cell aggregation in microcavity arrays.            	Stem-cell-derived epithelial organoids are routinely used for the biological and biomedical modelling of tissues. However, the complexity, lack of standardization and quality control of stem cell culture in solid extracellular matrices hampers the routine use of the organoids at the industrial scale. Here, we report the fabrication of microengineered cell culture devices and scalable and automated methods for suspension culture and real-time analysis of thousands of individual gastrointestinal organoids trapped in microcavity arrays within a polymer-hydrogel substrate. The absence of a solid matrix substantially reduces organoid heterogeneity, which we show for mouse and human gastrointestinal organoids. We use the devices to screen for anticancer drug candidates with patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids, and apply high-content image-based phenotypic analyses to reveal insights into mechanisms of drug action. The scalable organoid-culture technology should facilitate the use of organoids in drug development and diagnostics.	
28681151        	Three-Dimensional Spatiotemporal Modeling of Colon Cancer Organoids Reveals that Multimodal Control of Stem Cell Self-Renewal is a Critical Determinant of Size and Shape in Early Stages of Tumor Growth.            	We develop a three-dimensional multispecies mathematical model to simulate the growth of colon cancer organoids containing stem, progenitor and terminally differentiated cells, as a model of early (prevascular) tumor growth. Stem cells (SCs) secrete short-range self-renewal promoters (e.g., Wnt) and their long-range inhibitors (e.g., Dkk) and proliferate slowly. Committed progenitor (CP) cells proliferate more rapidly and differentiate to produce post-mitotic terminally differentiated cells that release differentiation promoters, forming negative feedback loops on SC and CP self-renewal. We demonstrate that SCs play a central role in normal and cancer colon organoids. Spatial patterning of the SC self-renewal promoter gives rise to SC clusters, which mimic stem cell niches, around the organoid surface, and drive the development of invasive fingers. We also study the effects of externally applied signaling factors. Applying bone morphogenic proteins, which inhibit SC and CP self-renewal, reduces invasiveness and organoid size. Applying hepatocyte growth factor, which enhances SC self-renewal, produces larger sizes and enhances finger development at low concentrations but suppresses fingers at high concentrations. These results are consistent with recent experiments on colon organoids. Because many cancers are hierarchically organized and are subject to feedback regulation similar to that in normal tissues, our results suggest that in cancer, control of cancer stem cell self-renewal should influence the size and shape in similar ways, thereby opening the door to novel therapies.	
32066960        	Cell-type-specific signaling networks in heterocellular organoids.            	Despite the widespread adoption of organoids as biomimetic tissue models, methods to comprehensively analyze cell-type-specific post-translational modification (PTM) signaling networks in organoids are absent. Here, we report multivariate single-cell analysis of such networks in organoids and organoid cocultures. Simultaneous analysis by mass cytometry of 28 PTMs in >1 million single cells derived from small intestinal organoids reveals cell-type- and cell-state-specific signaling networks in stem, Paneth, enteroendocrine, tuft and goblet cells, as well as enterocytes. Integrating single-cell PTM analysis with thiol-reactive organoid barcoding in situ (TOBis) enables high-throughput comparison of signaling networks between organoid cultures. Cell-type-specific PTM analysis of colorectal cancer organoid cocultures reveals that shApc, KrasG12D and Trp53R172H cell-autonomously mimic signaling states normally induced by stromal fibroblasts and macrophages. These results demonstrate how standard mass cytometry workflows can be modified to perform high-throughput multivariate cell-type-specific signaling analysis of healthy and cancerous organoids.	
30344100        	A Comprehensive Human Gastric Cancer Organoid Biobank Captures Tumor Subtype Heterogeneity and Enables Therapeutic Screening.            	Gastric cancer displays marked molecular heterogeneity with aggressive behavior and treatment resistance. Therefore, good in vitro models that encompass unique subtypes are urgently needed for precision medicine development. Here, we have established a primary gastric cancer organoid (GCO) biobank that comprises normal, dysplastic, cancer, and lymph node metastases (n = 63) from 34 patients, including detailed whole-exome and transcriptome analysis. The cohort encompasses most known molecular subtypes (including EBV, MSI, intestinal/CIN, and diffuse/GS, with CLDN18-ARHGAP6 or CTNND1-ARHGAP26 fusions or RHOA mutations), capturing regional heterogeneity and subclonal architecture, while their morphology, transcriptome, and genomic profiles remain closely similar to in vivo tumors, even after long-term culture. Large-scale drug screening revealed sensitivity to unexpected drugs that were recently approved or in clinical trials, including Napabucasin, Abemaciclib, and the ATR inhibitor VE-822. Overall, this new GCO biobank, with linked genomic data, provides a useful resource for studying both cancer cell biology and precision cancer therapy.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

29694897        	Glioblastoma Model Using Human Cerebral Organoids.            	We have developed a cancer model of gliomas in human cerebral organoids that allows direct observation of tumor initiation as well as continuous microscopic observations. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to target an HRasG12V-IRES-tdTomato construct by homologous recombination into the TP53 locus. Results show that transformed cells rapidly become invasive and destroy surrounding organoid structures, overwhelming the entire organoid. Tumor cells in the organoids can be orthotopically xenografted into immunodeficient NOD/SCID IL2RG-/- animals, exhibiting an invasive phenotype. Organoid-generated putative tumor cells show gene expression profiles consistent with mesenchymal subtype human glioblastoma. We further demonstrate that human-organoid-derived tumor cell lines or primary human-patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines can be transplanted into human cerebral organoids to establish invasive tumor-like structures. Our results show potential for the use of organoids as a platform to test human cancer phenotypes that recapitulate key aspects of malignancy.                Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

31011202        	An organoid platform for ovarian cancer captures intra- and interpatient heterogeneity.            	Ovarian cancer (OC) is a heterogeneous disease usually diagnosed at a late stage. Experimental in vitro models that faithfully capture the hallmarks and tumor heterogeneity of OC are limited and hard to establish. We present a protocol that enables efficient derivation and long-term expansion of OC organoids. Utilizing this protocol, we have established 56 organoid lines from 32 patients, representing all main subtypes of OC. OC organoids recapitulate histological and genomic features of the pertinent lesion from which they were derived, illustrating intra- and interpatient heterogeneity, and can be genetically modified. We show that OC organoids can be used for drug-screening assays and capture different tumor subtype responses to the gold standard platinum-based chemotherapy, including acquisition of chemoresistance in recurrent disease. Finally, OC organoids can be xenografted, enabling in vivo drug-sensitivity assays. Taken together, this demonstrates their potential application for research and personalized medicine.	
29853643        	Organoid Profiling Identifies Common Responders to Chemotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer.            	Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal common solid malignancy. Systemic therapies are often ineffective, and predictive biomarkers to guide treatment are urgently needed. We generated a pancreatic cancer patient-derived organoid (PDO) library that recapitulates the mutational spectrum and transcriptional subtypes of primary pancreatic cancer. New driver oncogenes were nominated and transcriptomic analyses revealed unique clusters. PDOs exhibited heterogeneous responses to standard-of-care chemotherapeutics and investigational agents. In a case study manner, we found that PDO therapeutic profiles paralleled patient outcomes and that PDOs enabled longitudinal assessment of chemosensitivity and evaluation of synchronous metastases. We derived organoid-based gene expression signatures of chemosensitivity that predicted improved responses for many patients to chemotherapy in both the adjuvant and advanced disease settings. Finally, we nominated alternative treatment strategies for chemorefractory PDOs using targeted agent therapeutic profiling. We propose that combined molecular and therapeutic profiling of PDOs may predict clinical response and enable prospective therapeutic selection.Significance: New approaches to prioritize treatment strategies are urgently needed to improve survival and quality of life for patients with pancreatic cancer. Combined genomic, transcriptomic, and therapeutic profiling of PDOs can identify molecular and functional subtypes of pancreatic cancer, predict therapeutic responses, and facilitate precision medicine for patients with pancreatic cancer.

32217638        	Organoid cultures of early-onset colorectal cancers reveal distinct and rare genetic profiles.            	Sporadic early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) has bad prognosis, yet is poorly represented by cell line models. We examine the key mutational and transcriptomic alterations in an organoid biobank enriched in EOCRCs.                We established paired cancer (n=32) and normal organoids (n=18) from 20 patients enriched in microsatellite-stable EOCRC. Exome and transcriptome analysis was performed.                We observed a striking diversity of molecular phenotypes, including PTPRK-RSPO3 fusions. Transcriptionally, RSPO fusion organoids resembled normal colon organoids and were distinct from APC mutant organoids, with high BMP2 and low PTK7 expression. Single cell transcriptome analysis confirmed the similarity between RSPO fusion organoids and normal organoids, with a propensity for maturation on Wnt withdrawal, whereas the APC mutant organoids were locked in progenitor stages. CRISPR/Cas9 engineered mutation of APC in normal human colon organoids led to upregulation of PTK7 protein and suppression of BMP2, but less so with an engineered RNF43 mutation. The frequent co-occurrence of RSPO fusions with SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutation was confirmed in TCGA database searches. RNF43 mutation was found in organoid from a leukaemia survivor with a novel mutational signature; and organoids with POLE proofreading mutation displayed ultramutation. The cancer organoid genomes were stable over long culture periods, while normal human colon organoids tended to be subject to clonal dominance over time.                These organoid models enriched in EOCRCs with linked genomic data fill a gap in existing CRC models and reveal distinct genetic profiles and novel pathway cooperativity.                © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

31661714        	Sample preparation strategies for high-throughput mass spectrometry imaging of primary tumor organoids.            	Patient-derived 3D organoids show great promise for understanding patient heterogeneity and chemotherapy response in human-derived tissue. The combination of organoid culture techniques with mass spectrometry imaging provides a label-free methodology for characterizing drug penetration, patient-specific response, and drug biotransformation. However, current methods used to grow tumor organoids employ extracellular matrices that can produce small molecule background signal during mass spectrometry imaging analysis. Here, we develop a method to isolate 3D human tumor organoids out of a Matrigel extracellular matrix into gelatin mass spectrometry compatible microarrays for high-throughput mass spectrometry imaging analysis. The alignment of multiple organoids in the same z-axis is essential for sectioning organoids together and for maintaining reproducible sample preparation on a single glass slide for up to hundreds of organoids. This method successfully removes organoids from extracellular matrix interference and provides an organized array for high-throughput imaging analysis to easily identify organoids by eye for area selection and further analysis. With this method, mass spectrometry imaging can be readily applied to organoid systems for preclinical drug development and personalized medicine research initiatives.                © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	
30213835        	Prediction of DNA Repair Inhibitor Response in Short-Term Patient-Derived Ovarian Cancer Organoids.            	Based on genomic analysis, 50% of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSC) are predicted to have DNA repair defects. Whether this substantial subset of HGSCs actually have functional repair defects remains unknown. Here, we devise a platform for functional profiling of DNA repair in short-term patient-derived HGSC organoids. We tested 33 organoid cultures derived from 22 patients with HGSC for defects in homologous recombination (HR) and replication fork protection. Regardless of DNA repair gene mutational status, a functional defect in HR in the organoids correlated with PARP inhibitor sensitivity. A functional defect in replication fork protection correlated with carboplatin and CHK1 and ATR inhibitor sensitivity. Our results indicate that a combination of genomic analysis and functional testing of organoids allows for the identification of targetable DNA damage repair defects. Larger numbers of patient-derived organoids must be analyzed to determine whether these assays can reproducibly predict patient response in the clinic.Significance: Patient-derived ovarian tumor organoids grow rapidly and match the tumors from which they are derived, both genetically and functionally. These organoids can be used for DNA repair profiling and therapeutic sensitivity testing and provide a rapid means of assessing targetable defects in the parent tumor, offering more suitable treatment options.

29360544        	Circulating tumor cell-derived organoids: Current challenges and promises in medical research and precision medicine.            	Traditional 2D cell cultures do not accurately recapitulate tumor heterogeneity, and insufficient human cell lines are available. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models more closely mimic clinical tumor heterogeneity, but are not useful for high-throughput drug screening. Recently, patient-derived organoid cultures have emerged as a novel technique to fill this critical need. Organoids maintain tumor tissue heterogeneity and drug-resistance responses, and thus are useful for high-throughput drug screening. Among various biological tissues used to produce organoid cultures, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are promising, due to relative ease of ascertainment. CTC-derived organoids could help to acquire relevant genetic and epigenetic information about tumors in real time, and screen and test promising drugs. This could reduce the need for tissue biopsies, which are painful and may be difficult depending on the tumor location. In this review, we have focused on advances in CTC isolation and organoid culture methods, and their potential applications in disease modeling and precision medicine.

28423498        	The PIAS3-Smurf2 sumoylation pathway suppresses breast cancer organoid invasiveness.            	Tumor metastasis profoundly reduces the survival of breast cancer patients, but the mechanisms underlying breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis are incompletely understood. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 acts in a sumoylation-dependent manner to suppress the invasive behavior of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell-derived organoids. We also find that the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS3 inhibits the invasive growth of breast cancer cell-derived organoids. In mechanistic studies, PIAS3 maintains breast cancer organoids in a non-invasive state via sumoylation of Smurf2. Importantly, the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is required for sumoylated Smurf2 to suppress the invasive growth of breast cancer-cell derived organoids. Collectively, our findings define a novel role for the PIAS3-Smurf2 sumoylation pathway in the suppression of breast cancer cell invasiveness. These findings lay the foundation for the development of novel biomarkers and targeted therapeutic approaches in breast cancer.	
29176677        	Organoids model distinct Vitamin E effects at different stages of prostate cancer evolution.            	Vitamin E increased prostate cancer risk in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) through unknown mechanisms while Selenium showed no efficacy. We determined the effects of the SELECT supplements on benign (primary), premalignant ( RWPE-1) and malignant (LNCaP) prostate epithelial organoids. While the supplements decreased proliferation and induced cell death in cancer organoids, they had no effect on the benign organoids. In contrast, Vitamin E enhanced cell proliferation and survival in the premalignant organoids in a manner that recapitulated the SELECT results. Indeed, while Vitamin E induced a pro-proliferative gene expression signature, Selenium alone or combined with Vitamin E produced an anti-proliferative signature. The premalignant organoids also displayed significant downregulation of glucose transporter and glycolytic gene expression pointing to metabolic alterations. Detached RWPE-1 cells had low ATP levels due to diminished glucose uptake and glycolysis which was rescued by Vitamin E through the activation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). FAO inhibition abrogated the ATP rescue, diminished survival of the inner matrix detached cells, restoring the normal hollow lumen morphology in Vitamin E treated organoids. Organoid models therefore clarify the paradoxical findings from SELECT and demonstrate that Vitamin E promotes tumorigenesis in the early stages of prostate cancer evolution.	
32535255        	Organoid models for mammary gland dynamics and breast cancer.            	The mammary gland is a highly dynamic tissue that undergoes repeated cycles of growth and involution during pregnancy and menstruation. It is also the site from which breast cancers emerge. Organoids provide an in vitro model that preserves several of the cellular, structural, and microenvironmental features that dictate mammary gland function in vivo and have greatly advanced our understanding of glandular biology. Their tractability for genetic manipulation, live imaging, and high throughput screening have facilitated investigation into the mechanisms of glandular morphogenesis, structural maintenance, tumor progression, and invasion. Opportunities remain to enhance cellular and structural complexity of mammary organoid models, including incorporating additional cell types and hormone signaling.                Copyright © 2020.

29966678        	Patient-derived tumor organoids for prediction of cancer treatment response.            	Cancer treatment, in particular radiotherapy and chemotherapy, is often hindered by an inherent resistance of cancer cells. Cancer stem cells in particular have previously been shown to be more resistant than other cells within a tumor and are thought repopulate the tumour after therapies. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop tools and techniques that can be used to study mechanisms of resistance of cancer stem cells as potential treatment targets. Organoids (and cancer-derived organoids), are three-dimensional tissue-resembling cellular clusters derived from tissue or tumor specific stem cells that mimic the in vivo (tumor) characteristics, as well as (tumor) cell heterogeneity. Cancer organoids may further enhance the in vitro and in vivo models that are currently available, improve our understanding of cancer stem cell resistance and can be used to develop novel cancer treatments by improved targeting of cancer stem cells. In this review, we compare organoids with the more traditional laboratory models, such as cell lines and xenografts, and review the literature of the current role of cancer organoids in determining treatment responses.

30176443        	Long-term organoid culture reveals enrichment of organoid-forming epithelial cells in the fimbrial portion of mouse fallopian tube.            	A recent paradigm shift in ovarian cancer research is the finding that many ovarian cancers may originate from fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells. As tissue stem and progenitor cells often serve as cells of origin of cancer, a better understanding of FTE stem/progenitor cells and how they become transformed is essential for early detection and prevention of ovarian cancer. To facilitate study of FTE stem/progenitor cells in model systems, we established an organoid culture system for mouse FTE cells. We find that EPCAM+ mouse FTE cells can be stably cultured long-term under a minimal condition of activated EGF signaling and suppressed TGFbeta signaling. We show that both Notch and Wnt signaling are required for growth of FTE cells in organoids, and further activation of Wnt signaling supports their maturation toward the ciliated cell lineage. Lastly, by analyzing the frequency of organoid-forming cells in different portions of the fallopian tube (FT), we find that the distal portion of the FT, which includes the fimbria, is enriched with organoid-forming FTE stem cells.

29174804        	Organoids: An intermediate modeling platform in precision oncology.            	Cancer harbors variable heterogeneity and plasticity. Thus far, our comprehension is greatly based on cell lines, organoids, and patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs). Organoids are a three-dimensional in vitro culture platform constructed from self-organizing stem cells. They can almost accurately recapitulate tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment "in a dish," which surpass established cell lines and are not as expensive and time-consuming as PDTXs. As an intermediate model, tumor organoids are also used to study the fundamental issues of tumorigenesis and metastasis. They are specifically applied for drug testing and stored as "living biobanks." In this review, we highlight the translational applications of organoid technologies in tumor research and precision medicine, discuss the advantages and limitations compared with other mentioned methods, and provide our outlook on its future.

28373416        	On-site Cytology for Development of Patient-Derived Three-dimensional Organoid Cultures - A Pilot Study.            	Development of patient-derived three-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures is an emerging technique in the field of precision oncology. We aimed to integrate on-site adequacy evaluation using cytology into the tumor organoid development workflow to ensure precise characterization and growth of these cultures.                Cancer patients were consented to a Precision Medicine trial. Fresh tissue was procured for genomic analyses as well as organoid development. Fresh tissue destined for organoid development was evaluated by preparing on-site cytology smears to ensure that only lesional tissue would be submitted for further cell culture work.                Cytology preparations were made from 64 different tumor samples and evaluated prior to tissue submission for organoid development. In 53 (82.2%) of those tumor samples, the cytology preparation was diagnostic, thus providing adequate material for organoid development.                Characterizing the tissue prior to submission for organoid development ensures submission of lesional tissue only. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective method that can help document patient diagnosis. This can be of importance in biopsies, since the tissue submitted for organoid development cannot be retrieved for clinical diagnosis afterwards. Our findings in this pilot study led to the implementation of on-site cytological evaluation in the tumor organoid development workflow at the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, NY, USA.

29692415        	Organoids in cancer research.            	The recent advances in in vitro 3D culture technologies, such as organoids, have opened new avenues for the development of novel, more physiological human cancer models. Such preclinical models are essential for more efficient translation of basic cancer research into novel treatment regimens for patients with cancer. Wild-type organoids can be grown from embryonic and adult stem cells and display self-organizing capacities, phenocopying essential aspects of the organs they are derived from. Genetic modification of organoids allows disease modelling in a setting that approaches the physiological environment. Additionally, organoids can be grown with high efficiency from patient-derived healthy and tumour tissues, potentially enabling patient-specific drug testing and the development of individualized treatment regimens. In this Review, we evaluate tumour organoid protocols and how they can be utilized as an alternative model for cancer research.	
29341164        	Patient-derived organoid models help define personalized management of gastrointestinal cancer.            	The prognosis of patients with different gastrointestinal cancers varies widely. Despite advances in treatment strategies, such as extensive resections and the addition of new drugs to chemotherapy regimens, conventional treatment strategies have failed to improve survival for many tumours. Although promising, the clinical application of molecularly guided personalized treatment has proven to be challenging. This narrative review focuses on the personalization of cancer therapy using patient-derived three-dimensional 'organoid' models.                A PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant articles. An overview of the literature and published protocols is presented, and the implications of these models for patients with cancer, surgeons and oncologists are explained.                Organoid culture methods have been established for healthy and diseased tissues from oesophagus, stomach, intestine, pancreas, bile duct and liver. Because organoids can be generated with high efficiency and speed from fine-needle aspirations, biopsies or resection specimens, they can serve as a personal cancer model. Personalized treatment could become a more standard practice by using these cell cultures for extensive molecular diagnosis and drug screening. Drug sensitivity assays can give a clinically actionable sensitivity profile of a patient's tumour. However, the predictive capability of organoid drug screening has not been evaluated in prospective clinical trials.                High-throughput drug screening on organoids, combined with next-generation sequencing, proteomic analysis and other state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic methods, can shape cancer treatment to become more effective with fewer side-effects.                © 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	
27845624        	Targeting mutant RAS in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids by combinatorial drug screening.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids can be derived from almost all CRC patients and therefore capture the genetic diversity of this disease. We assembled a panel of CRC organoids carrying either wild-type or mutant RAS, as well as normal organoids and tumor organoids with a CRISPR-introduced oncogenic KRAS mutation. Using this panel, we evaluated RAS pathway inhibitors and drug combinations that are currently in clinical trial for RAS mutant cancers. Presence of mutant RAS correlated strongly with resistance to these targeted therapies. This was observed in tumorigenic as well as in normal organoids. Moreover, dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway in RAS mutant organoids induced a transient cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant organoids confirmed this growth arrest upon pan-HER/MEK combination therapy. Altogether, our studies demonstrate the potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting.	
28922975        	Bioengineered Submucosal Organoids for In Vitro Modeling of Colorectal Cancer.            	The physical nature of the tumor microenvironment significantly impacts tumor growth, invasion, and response to drugs. Most in vitro tumor models are designed to study the effects of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness on tumor cells, while not addressing the effects of ECM's specific topography. In this study, we bioengineered submucosal organoids, using primary smooth muscle cells embedded in collagen I hydrogel, which produce aligned and parallel fiber topography similar to those found in vivo. The fiber organization in the submucosal organoids induced an epithelial phenotype in spheroids of colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT-116), which were embedded within the organoids. Conversely, unorganized fibers drove a mesenchymal phenotype in the tumor cells. HCT-116 cells in organoids with aligned fibers showed no WNT signaling activation, and conversely, WNT signaling activation was observed in organoids with disrupted fibers. Consequently, HCT-116 cells in the aligned condition exhibited decreased cellular proliferation and reduced sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil chemotherapeutic treatment compared to cells in the unorganized construct. Collectively, the results establish a unique colorectal tumor organoid model to study the effects of stromal topography on cancer cell phenotype, proliferation, and ultimately, chemotherapeutic susceptibility. In the future, such organoids can utilize patient-derived cells for precision medicine applications.	
29921838        	Patient derived organoids to model rare prostate cancer phenotypes.            	A major hurdle in the study of rare tumors is a lack of existing preclinical models. Neuroendocrine prostate cancer is an uncommon and aggressive histologic variant of prostate cancer that may arise de novo or as a mechanism of treatment resistance in patients with pre-existing castration-resistant prostate cancer. There are few available models to study neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Here, we report the generation and characterization of tumor organoids derived from needle biopsies of metastatic lesions from four patients. We demonstrate genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic concordance between organoids and their corresponding patient tumors. We utilize these organoids to understand the biologic role of the epigenetic modifier EZH2 in driving molecular programs associated with neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression. High-throughput organoid drug screening nominated single agents and drug combinations suggesting repurposing opportunities. This proof of principle study represents a strategy for the study of rare cancer phenotypes.	
30261425        	Studying cellular heterogeneity and drug sensitivity in colorectal cancer using organoid technology.            	Intra-tumor heterogeneity (genotypic and functional diversity among cancer cells within the same tumor) represents one of the key challenges in cancer medicine. As heterogeneity of cancer cells constitutes an important parameter in the development of therapy resistance, an accurate assessment of intra-tumor heterogeneity is essential for the prediction of drug resistance and development of effective treatment. In this review, we evaluate primary patient derived-tumor organoid technology as a new tool for colorectal cancer research and treatment. Furthermore, we discuss organoid use to understand intra-tumor heterogeneity, both in terms of mutational diversification and of diversification in drug sensitivity. Finally, we address the exciting recent results that show that tumor organoid technology is highly predictive for drug response in metastatic colorectal cancer.

31710046        	Prostate Organoid Cultures as Tools to Translate Genotypes and Mutational Profiles to Pharmacological Responses.            	Presented here is a protocol to study pharmacodynamics, stem cell potential, and cancer differentiation in prostate epithelial organoids. Prostate organoids are androgen responsive, three-dimensional (3D) cultures grown in a defined medium that resembles the prostatic epithelium. Prostate organoids can be established from wild-type and genetically engineered mouse models, benign human tissue, and advanced prostate cancer. Importantly, patient derived organoids closely resemble tumors in genetics and in vivo tumor biology. Moreover, organoids can be genetically manipulated using CRISPR/Cas9 and shRNA systems. These controlled genetics make the organoid culture attractive as a platform for rapidly testing the effects of genotypes and mutational profiles on pharmacological responses. However, experimental protocols must be specifically adapted to the 3D nature of organoid cultures to obtain reproducible results. Described here are detailed protocols for performing seeding assays to determine organoid formation capacity. Subsequently, this report shows how to perform drug treatments and analyze pharmacological response via viability measurements, protein isolation, and RNA isolation. Finally, the protocol describes how to prepare organoids for xenografting and subsequent in vivo growth assays using subcutaneous grafting. These protocols yield highly reproducible data and are widely applicable to 3D culture systems.	
32099092        	Organoid models of gastrointestinal cancers in basic and translational research.            	Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide. Gastrointestinal cancers account for approximately one-third of the total global cancer incidence and mortality. Historically, the mechanisms of tumour initiation and progression in the gastrointestinal tract have been studied using cancer cell lines in vitro and animal models. Traditional cell culture methods are associated with a strong selection of aberrant genomic variants that no longer reflect the original tumours in terms of their (metastatic) behaviour or response to therapy. Organoid technology has emerged as a powerful alternative method for culturing gastrointestinal tumours and the corresponding normal tissues in a manner that preserves their genetic, phenotypic and behavioural traits. Importantly, accumulating evidence suggests that organoid cultures have great value in predicting the outcome of therapy in individual patients. Herein, we review the current literature on organoid models of the most common gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, oesophageal cancer, liver cancer and pancreatic cancer, and their value in modelling tumour initiation, metastatic progression and therapy response. We also explore the limitations of current organoid models and discuss how they could be improved to maximally benefit basic and translational research in the future, especially in the fields of drug discovery and personalized medicine.	
31724799        	Kinase activity of ERBB3 contributes to intestinal organoids growth and intestinal tumorigenesis.            	As a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, ERBB3 plays an essential role in development and disease independent of inherently inactive kinase domain. Recently, ERBB3 has been found to bind to ATP and has catalytic activity in vitro. However, the biological function of ERBB3 kinase activity remains elusive in vivo. Here we have identified the physiological function of inactivated ERBB3 kinase activity by creating Erbb3-K740M knockin mice in which ATP cannot bind to ERBB3. Unlike Erbb3 knockout mice, kinase-inactive Erbb3K740M homozygous mice were born in Mendelian ratios and showed normal development. After dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, the kinase-inactive Erbb3 mutant mice showed normal recovery. However, the outgrowth of ileal organoids by neuregulin-1 treatment was more attenuated in Erbb3 mutant mice than in WT mice. Moreover, in combination with the ApcMin mouse, the proportion of polyps less than 1 mm in diameter in mutant mice was higher than in control mice and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed in polyps from mutant mice compared with polyps from control mice. Taken together, the ERBB3 kinase activity contributes to the outgrowth of ileal organoids and intestinal tumorigenesis, and the development of ERBB3 kinase inhibitors, including epidermal growth factor receptor family members, can be a potential way to target colorectal cancer.                © 2019 The Authors.

24232854        	Establishment of a novel lingual organoid culture system: generation of organoids having mature keratinized epithelium from adult epithelial stem cells.            	Despite the strong need for the establishment of a lingual epithelial cell culture system, a simple and convenient culture method has not yet been established. Here, we report the establishment of a novel lingual epithelium organoid culture system using a three-dimensional matrix and growth factors. Histological analyses showed that the generated organoids had both a stratified squamous epithelial cell layer and a stratum corneum. Very recently, we showed via a multicolor lineage tracing method that Bmi1-positive stem cells exist at the base of the epithelial basal layer in the interpapillary pit. Using our new culture system, we found that organoids could be generated by single Bmi1-positive stem cells and that in the established organoids, multiple Bmi1-positive stem cells were generated at the outermost layer. Moreover, we observed that organoids harvested at an early point in culture could be engrafted and maturate in the tongue of recipient mice and that the organoids generated from carcinogen-treated mice had an abnormal morphology. Thus, this culture system presents valuable settings for studying not only the regulatory mechanisms of lingual epithelium but also lingual regeneration and carcinogenesis.	
32774159        	Establishment and characterization of breast cancer organoids from a patient with mammary Paget's disease.            	Mammary Paget's disease (MPD) is an uncommon cutaneous intraepithelial malignancy with ulceration of the nipple or areola. Its pathogenesis and genomic mutation remain largely unknown and no cell lines are established from primary tumors.                We collected surgical tumor specimens from a 65-year-old Chinese woman diagnosed with MPD and established patient-derived breast cancer (BC) organoids from MPD using organoid culture technology.                We successfully propagated BC organoids from a patient with MPD for more than 6 months. The organoids were cultured for long-term expansion without any change in spherical organoid morphology. Besides, the spherical organoid morphology did not change when they underwent cryopreservation after resuscitation. The H&E staining and immunohistochemistry analyses showed the similar morphological and histological features of the organoids compared with their paired original BC tissues. The organoids retained positive expression of breast cancer biomarkers: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, antigen Ki-67 and negative expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. We also showed that MPD organoids recapitulated the unique genomic landscape including copy number alterations, mutational load, mutational signatures and cancer gene mutations by whole genome sequencing. In situ senescence-associated acid beta galactosidase assay confirmed senescence phenomenon existed in the process of organoids culture and there was no significant difference in the proportion of senescent organoids after organoid passage and resuscitation.                Our results suggested that an effective platform for ex vivo BC organoids from MPD patients could be used to explore clinicopathological and genomic characteristics of these patients.                © The Author(s) 2020.	
31734267        	Molecular signature of interleukin-22 in colon carcinoma cells and organoid models.            	Interleukin (IL)-22 activates STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) 3 and antiapoptotic and proproliferative pathways; but beyond this, the molecular mechanisms by which IL-22 promotes carcinogenesis are poorly understood. Characterizing the molecular signature of IL-22 in human DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells, we observed increased expression of 26 genes, including NNMT (nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, ≤10-fold) and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen, ≤7-fold), both known to promote intestinal carcinogenesis. ERP27 (endoplasmic reticulum protein-27, function unknown, ≤5-fold) and the proinflammatory ICAM1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ≤4-fold) were also increased. The effect on CEA was partly STAT3-mediated, as STAT3-silencing reduced IL-22-induced CEA by ≤56%. Silencing of CEA or NNMT inhibited IL-22-induced proliferation/migration of DLD-1, Caco-2, and SW480 colon carcinoma cells. To validate these results in primary tissues, we assessed IL-22-induced gene expression in organoids from human healthy colon and colon cancer patients, and from normal mouse small intestine and colon. Gene regulation by IL-22 was similar in DLD-1 cells and human and mouse healthy organoids. CEA was an exception with no induction by IL-22 in organoids, indicating the 3-dimensional organization of the tissue may produce signals absent in 2D cell culture. Importantly, augmentation of NNMT was 5-14-fold greater in human cancerous compared to normal organoids, supporting a role for NNMT in IL-22-mediated colon carcinogenesis. Thus, NNMT and CEA emerge as mediators of the tumor-promoting effects of IL-22 in the intestine. These data advance our understanding of the multifaceted role of IL-22 in the gut and suggest the IL-22 pathway may represent a therapeutic target in colon cancer.

28052255        	Personalized Proteome Profiles of Healthy and Tumor Human Colon Organoids Reveal Both Individual Diversity and Basic Features of Colorectal Cancer.            	Diseases at the molecular level are complex and patient dependent, necessitating development of strategies that enable precision treatment to optimize clinical outcomes. Organoid technology has recently been shown to have the potential to recapitulate the in vivo characteristics of the original individual's tissue in a three-dimensional in vitro culture system. Here, we present a quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis and a comparative transcriptomic analysis of human colorectal tumor and healthy organoids derived, in parallel, from seven patients. Although gene and protein signatures can be derived to distinguish the tumor organoid population from healthy organoids, our data clearly reveal that each patient possesses a distinct organoid signature at the proteomic level. We demonstrate that a personalized patient-specific organoid proteome profile can be related to the diagnosis of a patient and with future development contribute to the generation of personalized therapies.

28341301        	Disease Modeling in Stem Cell-Derived 3D Organoid Systems.            	Organoids are 3D in vitro culture systems derived from self-organizing stem cells. They can recapitulate the in vivo architecture, functionality, and genetic signature of original tissues. Thus, organoid technology has been rapidly applied to understanding stem cell biology, organogenesis, and various human pathologies. The recent development of human patient-derived organoids has enabled disease modeling with precision, highlighting their great potential in biomedical applications, translational medicine, and personalized therapy. In light of recent breakthroughs using organoids, it is only apt that we appreciate the advantages and shortcomings of this technology to exploit its full potential. We discuss recent advances in the application of organoids in studying cancer and hereditary diseases, as well as in the examination of host cell-microorganism interactions.

32792685        	BRAFV600E drives dedifferentiation in small intestinal and colonic organoids and cooperates with mutant p53 and Apc loss in transformation.            	BRAFV600E confers poor prognosis and is associated with a distinct subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC). Little is known, however, about the genetic events driving the initiation and progression of BRAFV600E mutant CRCs. Recent genetic analyses of CRCs indicate that BRAFV600E often coexists with alterations in the WNT- and p53 pathways, but their cooperation remains ill-defined. Therefore, we systematically compared small and large intestinal organoids from mice harboring conditional BraffloxV600E, Trp53LSL-R172H, and/or Apcflox/flox alleles. Using these isogenic models, we observe tissue-specific differences toward sudden BRAFV600E expression, which can be attributed to different ERK-pathway ground states in small and large intestinal crypts. BRAFV600E alone causes transient proliferation and suppresses epithelial organization, followed by organoid disintegration. Moreover, BRAFV600E induces a fetal-like dedifferentiation transcriptional program in colonic organoids, which resembles human BRAFV600E-driven CRC. Co-expression of p53R172H delays organoid disintegration, confers anchorage-independent growth, and induces invasive properties. Interestingly, p53R172H cooperates with BRAFV600E to modulate the abundance of transcripts linked to carcinogenesis, in particular within colonic organoids. Remarkably, WNT-pathway activation by Apc deletion fully protects organoids against BRAFV600E-induced disintegration and confers growth/niche factor independence. Still, Apc-deficient BRAFV600E-mutant organoids remain sensitive toward the MEK inhibitor trametinib, albeit p53R172H confers partial resistance against this clinically relevant compound. In summary, our systematic comparison of the response of small and large intestinal organoids to oncogenic alterations suggests colonic organoids to be better suited to model the human situation. In addition, our work on BRAF-, p53-, and WNT-pathway mutations provides new insights into their cooperation and for the design of targeted therapies.	
33310278        	Patient-derived organoids as individual patient models for chemoradiation response prediction in gastrointestinal malignancies.            	Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is an important treatment modality for specific gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, as it has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. Recent developments in the neoadjuvant setting such as wait-and-see strategies for rectal as well as for esophageal cancers have even proven that CRT might be an effective organ-sparing treatment. However, due to molecular heterogeneity, only a subset of patients will show a complete response to CRT, which addresses the need for an individualized treatment approach. In recent years, the demand for more physiologically relevant predictive in vitro models has fostered the development of patient-derived tumor organoids. In this review, we describe the current treatment options for patients with GI cancers who are treated with (neo)adjuvant CRT. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth discussion of the organoid technology in the context of predicting CRT response for GI cancers as well as possible challenges for clinical implementation.

30955861        	Phenotypic heterogeneity of 2D organoid reflects clinical tumor characteristics.            	Unlike cancer cell lines, tumors and primary cultured cells exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity. Although methods for establishing organoids within three-dimensional (3D) gels are well-known, the growth is slower than that of two-dimensional (2D) cultured cells and many niche factors need to be added. In this study, we established primary cultured organoid in 2D culture (2D organoid; 2DO) in a reproducible manner and with clinical phenotypic heterogeneity. The 2DO contained cancer stem cells (CSCs) expressing CD44 and CD133. The addition of basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β as niche factors was necessary to establish the 2DO and maintain the CSC population. The established 2DO showed sufficient proliferation, and the culture could be transferred to the 3D culture. Morphological analysis of the xenograft induced by 2DO reflected parental tumor differentiation, and gene expression in the 2DO was similar to that in the parental tumor. In vitro drug sensitivity analysis using the 2DO reflected individual clinical courses. The 2DO is an in vitro personal cancer model, and the results of the drug sensitivity assessment may be useful for introducing clinical chemotherapy agents in personalized medicine.

29589318        	Use of Organoids to Characterize Signaling Pathways in Cancer Initiation.            	The development of intestinal organoid technology has greatly accelerated research in the field of colorectal cancer. Contrary to traditional cancer cell lines, organoids are composed of multiple cell types arranged in 3D structures highly reminiscent of their native tissues. Thus, organoids provide a near-physiological and readily accessible model to study tissue morphogenesis, adult stem cell behavior and tumorigenesis. Here, we provide protocols for establishing intestinal organoid cultures from genetically modified mouse lines and describe methods to overexpress and knockout genes of interest using lentiviral-based approaches.	
32603978        	Organoid technology and applications in cancer immunotherapy and precision medicine.            	Tumors are complex ecosystems of multiple cell types in addition to cancer cells. The response to therapies can be shaped by not only cancer cell vulnerabilities but also by the cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME). For cellular immune therapies, cancer cells are the direct target, but for most of the immune checkpoint blockades (ICB), the direct therapeutic targets are the immune cells. Current immune therapy approaches, especially immune checkpoint blockades, only work for select patient populations. A pre-treatment, ex vivo assay could help in selecting between immune therapy options. However, for immune therapy applications, ex vivo assays would require the co-culturing of both cancer cells and cells of the TME. New results show that it is now feasible to co-culture both cell types with organoid technologies. However, many challenges remain to both optimize organoid cultures as well as to validate ex vivo assays as predictors of therapeutic benefits from immune therapies.                Copyright © 2020.

29463813        	Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) target cancer stem-like cells and suppress tumor organoid formation in colorectal cancer.            	Proanthocyanidins are a heterogeneous group of flavan-3-ol or flavan-3,4-diol oligomers present in various fruits and vegetables. In particular, the smaller oligomeric subset of proanthocyanidins, termed the oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) appear to have potent anti-tumorigenic properties, but the underlying mechanisms for their effectiveness remain unclear. Herein, we utilized a series of in vitro, in vivo and patient-derived organoid approaches to systematically investigate the chemoprotective role of OPCs in colorectal cancer. OPCs exerted anti-tumorigenic effects through inhibition of cellular proliferation, and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Intriguingly, OPCs suppressed spheroid derived cancer stem-like cell formation and decreased the expression of intestinal cancer stem cell markers including LGR5, CD44 and CD133. Mechanistically, RNA-sequencing results confirmed that OPCs prominently interfered with developmental and self-renewal pathways and identified several self-renewal associated oncogenes targeted by OPCs. Furthermore, OPCs inhibited Hippo pathway through downregulation of its key transcriptional regulators, YAP and TAZ. Finally, we confirmed anti-tumorigenic effects of OPCs using multiple xenograft experiments and recapitulated its protective effects using patient-derived colorectal tumor organoids. Collectively, we have comprehensively assessed anti-tumorigenic properties of OPCs and our data throws light on previously unrecognized chemopreventive mechanisms of OPCs highlighting its therapeutic potential.	
33237353        	Shared extracellular vesicle miRNA profiles of matched ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma organoids and blood plasma samples show the power of organoid technology.            	Extracellular vesicles (EV) are considered as a promising diagnostic tool for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a disease with a poor 5-year survival that has not improved in the past years. PDAC patient-derived 3D organoids maintain the intratumoral cellular heterogeneity, characteristic for the tumor in vivo.Thus, they represent an ideal in vitro model system to study human cancers. Here we show that the miRNA cargo of EVs from PDAC organoids largely differs among patients. However, we detected a common set of EV miRNAs that were present in matched organoids and blood plasma samples of individual patients. Importantly, the levels of EV miR-21 and miR-195 were higher in PDAC blood EV preparations than in healthy controls, albeit we found no difference compared to chronic pancreatitis (CP) samples. In addition, here we report that the accumulation of collagen I, a characteristic change in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in both CP and PDAC, largely increases EV release from pancreatic ductal organoids. This provides a possible explanation why both CP and PDAC patient-derived plasma samples have an elevated amount of CD63 + EVs. Collectively, we show that PDAC patient-derived organoids represent a highly relevant model to analyze the cargo of tumor cell-derived EVs. Furthermore, we provide evidence that not only driver mutations, but also changes in the ECM may critically modify EV release from pancreatic ductal cells.	
25557080        	Organoid models of human and mouse ductal pancreatic cancer.            	Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies due to its late diagnosis and limited response to treatment. Tractable methods to identify and interrogate pathways involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis are urgently needed. We established organoid models from normal and neoplastic murine and human pancreas tissues. Pancreatic organoids can be rapidly generated from resected tumors and biopsies, survive cryopreservation, and exhibit ductal- and disease-stage-specific characteristics. Orthotopically transplanted neoplastic organoids recapitulate the full spectrum of tumor development by forming early-grade neoplasms that progress to locally invasive and metastatic carcinomas. Due to their ability to be genetically manipulated, organoids are a platform to probe genetic cooperation. Comprehensive transcriptional and proteomic analyses of murine pancreatic organoids revealed genes and pathways altered during disease progression. The confirmation of many of these protein changes in human tissues demonstrates that organoids are a facile model system to discover characteristics of this deadly malignancy.

Kidney tumours are among the most common solid tumours in children, comprising distinct subtypes differing in many aspects, including cell-of-origin, genetics, and pathology. Pre-clinical cell models capturing the disease heterogeneity are currently lacking. Here, we describe the first paediatric cancer organoid biobank. It contains tumour and matching normal kidney organoids from over 50 children with different subtypes of kidney cancer, including Wilms tumours, malignant rhabdoid tumours, renal cell carcinomas, and congenital mesoblastic nephromas. Paediatric kidney tumour organoids retain key properties of native tumours, useful for revealing patient-specific drug sensitivities. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and high resolution 3D imaging, we further demonstrate that organoid cultures derived from Wilms tumours consist of multiple different cell types, including epithelial, stromal and blastemal-like cells. Our organoid biobank captures the heterogeneity of paediatric kidney tumours, providing a representative collection of well-characterised models for basic cancer research, drug-screening and personalised medicine.	
29300388        	Colonoscopy-based colorectal cancer modeling in mice with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and organoid transplantation.            	Most genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of colorectal cancer are limited by tumor formation in the small intestine, a high tumor burden that limits metastasis, and the need to generate and cross mutant mice. Cell line or organoid transplantation models generally produce tumors in ectopic locations-such as the subcutaneous space, kidney capsule, or cecal wall-that do not reflect the native stromal environment of the colon mucosa. Here, we describe detailed protocols to rapidly and efficiently induce site-directed tumors in the distal colon of mice that are based on colonoscopy-guided mucosal injection. These techniques can be adapted to deliver viral vectors carrying Cre recombinase, CRISPR-Cas9 components, CRISPR-engineered mouse tumor organoids, or human cancer organoids to mice to model the adenoma-carcinoma-metastasis sequence of tumor progression. The colonoscopy injection procedure takes ∼15 min, including preparation. In our experience, anyone with reasonable hand-eye coordination can become proficient with mouse colonoscopy and mucosal injection with a few hours of practice. These approaches are ideal for a wide range of applications, including assessment of gene function in tumorigenesis, examination of tumor-stroma interactions, studies of cancer metastasis, and translational research with patient-derived cancers.	
30503340        	Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 enriched organoids under chemically-defined growth conditions.            	An organoid is a complex, multi-cell three-dimensional (3D) structure that contains tissue-specific cells. Epithelial stem cells, which are marked by leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), have the potential for self-renewal and expansion as organoids. However, in the case of intestinal organoids from Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 transgenic mice, in vitro expansion of the Lgr5 expression is limited in a culture condition supplemented with essential proteins, such as epidermal growth factor (E), noggin (N), and R-spondin 1 (R). In this study, we hypothesized that self-renewal of Lgr5+ stem cells in a 3D culture system can be stimulated by defined compounds (CHIR99021, Valproic acid, Y-27632, and A83-01). Our results demonstrated that dissociated single cells from organoids were organized into a 3D structure in the four compounds containing the ENR culture medium in a 3D and two-dimensional (2D) culture system. Moreover, the Lgr5 expression level of organoids from the ENR- and compound-containing media increased. Furthermore, the conversion of cultured Lgr5+ stem cells from 2D to 3D was confirmed. Therefore, defined compounds promote the expansion of Lgr5+ stem cells in organoids.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
32422143        	DC-SCRIPT affects mammary organoids branching morphogenesis by modulating the FGFR1-pERK signaling axis.            	Loss of expression of the transcription regulator DC-SCRIPT (Zfp366) is a prominent prognostic event in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients. Studying the inherent link between breast morphogenesis and tumorigenesis, we recently reported that DC-SCRIPT affects normal mammary branching morphogenesis and mammary epithelium homeostasis. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in DC-SCRIPT mediated regulation of FGF2 induced mammary branching morphogenesis in a 3D organoid culture system. Our data show that the delayed mammary organoid branching observed in DC-SCRIPT-/- organoids cannot be compensated for by increasing FGF2 levels. Interestingly, FGFR1, the dominant FGF2 receptor, was expressed at a significantly lower level in basal epithelial cells of DC-SCRIPT deficient organoids relative to wildtype organoids. A potential link between DC-SCRIPT and FGFR1 was further supported by the predicted locations of the DC-SCRIPT DNA binding motif at the Fgfr1 gene. Moreover, ERK1/2 phosphorylation downstream of the FGFR1 pathway was decreased in basal epithelial cells of DC-SCRIPT deficient organoids. Altogether, this study shows a relationship between DC-SCRIPT and FGFR1 related pERK signaling in modulating the branching morphogenesis of mammary organoids in vitro.

31371824        	Patient-derived organoids from endometrial disease capture clinical heterogeneity and are amenable to drug screening.            	Endometrial disorders represent a major gynaecological burden. Current research models fail to recapitulate the nature and heterogeneity of these diseases, thereby hampering scientific and clinical progress. Here we developed long-term expandable organoids from a broad spectrum of endometrial pathologies. Organoids from endometriosis show disease-associated traits and cancer-linked mutations. Endometrial cancer-derived organoids accurately capture cancer subtypes, replicate the mutational landscape of the tumours and display patient-specific drug responses. Organoids were also established from precancerous pathologies encompassing endometrial hyperplasia and Lynch syndrome, and inherited gene mutations were maintained. Endometrial disease organoids reproduced the original lesion when transplanted in vivo. In summary, we developed multiple organoid models that capture endometrial disease diversity and will provide powerful research models and drug screening and discovery tools.	
32009658        	Isolation and Characterization of Patient-derived Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Organoid Models.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is amongst the most lethal malignancies. Recently, next-generation organoid culture methods enabling the 3-dimensional (3D) modeling of this disease have been described. Patient-derived organoid (PDO) models can be isolated from both surgical specimens as well as small biopsies and form rapidly in culture. Importantly, organoid models preserve the pathogenic genetic alterations detected in the patient's tumor and are predictive of the patient's treatment response, thus enabling translational studies. Here, we provide comprehensive protocols for adapting tissue culture workflow to study 3D, matrix embedded, organoid models. We detail methods and considerations for isolating and propagating primary PDAC organoids. Furthermore, we describe how bespoke organoid media is prepared and quality controlled in the laboratory. Finally, we describe assays for downstream characterization of the organoid models such as isolation of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and drug testing. Importantly we provide critical considerations for implementing organoid methodology in a research laboratory.	
29893059        	Application of porcine gastrointestinal organoid units as a potential in vitro tool for drug discovery and development.            	The gastrointestinal tract (GI) is a crucial part of the body for growth and development and its dysregulation can lead to several diseases with detrimental effects. Most of these diseases lack effective treatment, occurring as a result of inappropriate models to develop safe and potent therapies. Organoids are three-dimensional self-organizing and self-renewing structures that are composed of a cluster of different cells in vitro that resemble their organ of origin in architecture and function. Over recent years, organoids have been increasingly used to study developmental biology, disease progression, i.e., cancer, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and other biological processes. Owing to their complex nature and ability to retain the morphological and molecular patterns of their tissue-of-origin, they have great potential as alternative tools/models for drug screening, development and biomarker discovery. Using a species with similar genetic homology to humans as a source of organoids, such as the porcine model may offer huge translational relevance. This review focuses on the culture and establishment of porcine organoid units and their potential use and application as in vitro models to further the science of drug discovery, by overcoming current limitations of established two- and three-dimensional models. It also highlights the translational application of using porcine organoids as a model of different disease contexts.                Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	
31853056        	Tumor organoid-T-cell coculture systems.            	T cells are key players in cancer immunotherapy, but strategies to expand tumor-reactive cells and study their interactions with tumor cells at the level of an individual patient are limited. Here we describe the generation and functional assessment of tumor-reactive T cells based on cocultures of tumor organoids and autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes. The procedure consists of an initial coculture of 2 weeks, in which tumor-reactive T cells are first expanded in the presence of (IFNγ-stimulated) autologous tumor cells. Subsequently, T cells are evaluated for their capacity to carry out effector functions (IFNγ secretion and degranulation) after recognition of tumor cells, and their capacity to kill tumor organoids. This strategy is unique in its use of peripheral blood as a source of tumor-reactive T cells in an antigen-agnostic manner. In 2 weeks, tumor-reactive CD8+ T-cell populations can be obtained from ~33-50% of samples from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and microsatellite-instable colorectal cancer (CRC). This enables the establishment of ex vivo test systems for T-cell-based immunotherapy at the level of the individual patient.	
30353124        	A three-dimensional organoid model recapitulates tumorigenic aspects and drug responses of advanced human retinoblastoma.            	Persistent or recurrent retinoblastoma (RB) is associated with the presence of vitreous or/and subretinal seeds in advanced RB and represents a major cause of therapeutic failure. This necessitates the development of novel therapies and thus requires a model of advanced RB for testing candidate therapeutics. To this aim, we established and characterized a three-dimensional, self-organizing organoid model derived from chemotherapy-naïve tumors. The responses of organoids to drugs were determined and compared to relate organoid model to advanced RB, in terms of drug sensitivities. We found that organoids had histological features resembling retinal tumors and seeds and retained DNA copy-number alterations as well as gene and protein expression of the parental tissue. Cone signal circuitry (M/L+ cells) and glial tumor microenvironment (GFAP+ cells) were primarily present in organoids. Topotecan alone or the combined drug regimen of topotecan and melphalan effectively targeted proliferative tumor cones (RXRγ+ Ki67+) in organoids after 24-h drug exposure, blocking mitotic entry. In contrast, methotrexate showed the least efficacy against tumor cells. The drug responses of organoids were consistent with those of tumor cells in advanced disease. Patient-derived organoids enable the creation of a faithful model to use in examining novel therapeutics for RB.	
31265190        	Establishment and characterization of patient-derived organoids from a young patient with cervical clear cell carcinoma.            	Cervical clear cell carcinoma (cCCC) constitutes an extremely rare subtype of cervical cancer. Consequently, its pathogenesis remains largely unknown, with no cell lines established from primary tumors. Here, we report the first establishment of cCCC organoids, from biopsy samples of a 23-year-old patient diagnosed with cCCC. By applying a protocol that we recently optimized for gynecological tumors, we were able to propagate a patient-derived cell line (PDC) for more than 6 months as organoids. This PDC tolerated cryopreservation and proliferated either as spheroids or adherent cells, and developed xenografts in immunodeficient mice, ensuring robust utility as a cell line. Intriguingly, the resected tumor focally contained serous carcinoma (SC) in a tiny protruding lesion. Both organoids and derivative xenografts resembled the CCC component of the original tumor in histology, immunostaining profile, and genome-wide copy number changes, including focal gain of MET. Genomic analysis revealed that both organoids and the CCC component harbored only a few mutations, of which 2 mutations were shared in common. In contrast, the SC component showed a mutator-phenotype and prominent genome instability along with biallelic inactivation of TP53, but none of them were found in organoids or the CCC component. The PDC proved sensitive to major chemotherapeutic agents and MET inhibitors. These observations clearly indicated that the PDC, designated as YMC7, can be used as a novel cCCC cell line and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of mixed cervical adenocarcinoma. As a valuable resource for rare cancer, it will likely contribute to investigations in many fields.                © 2019 The Authors.

28588148        	Functional Optical Imaging of Primary Human Tumor Organoids: Development of a Personalized Drug Screen.            	Primary tumor organoids are a robust model of individual human cancers and present a unique platform for patient-specific drug testing. Optical imaging is uniquely suited to assess organoid function and behavior because of its subcellular resolution, penetration depth through the entire organoid, and functional endpoints. Specifically, optical metabolic imaging (OMI) is highly sensitive to drug response in organoids, and OMI in tumor organoids correlates with primary tumor drug response. Therefore, an OMI organoid drug screen could enable accurate testing of drug response for individualized cancer treatment. The objective of this perspective is to introduce OMI and tumor organoids to a general audience in order to foster the adoption of these techniques in diverse clinical and laboratory settings.                © 2017 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.	
30171177        	Human Organoids Share Structural and Genetic Features with Primary Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Tumors.            	Patient-derived pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) organoid systems show great promise for understanding the biological underpinnings of disease and advancing therapeutic precision medicine. Despite the increased use of organoids, the fidelity of molecular features, genetic heterogeneity, and drug response to the tumor of origin remain important unanswered questions limiting their utility. To address this gap in knowledge, primary tumor- and patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-derived organoids, and 2D cultures for in-depth genomic and histopathologic comparisons with the primary tumor were created. Histopathologic features and PDAC representative protein markers (e.g., claudin 4 and CA19-9) showed strong concordance. DNA- and RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) of single organoids revealed patient-specific genomic and transcriptomic consistency. Single-cell RNAseq demonstrated that organoids are primarily a clonal population. In drug response assays, organoids displayed patient-specific sensitivities. In addition, the in vivo PDX response to FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine/abraxane treatments were examined, which was recapitulated in vitro with organoids. This study has demonstrated that organoids are potentially invaluable for precision medicine as well as preclinical drug treatment studies because they maintain distinct patient phenotypes and respond differently to drug combinations and dosage. IMPLICATIONS: The patient-specific molecular and histopathologic fidelity of organoids indicate that they can be used to understand the etiology of the patient's tumor and the differential response to therapies and suggests utility for predicting drug responses.                ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.	
29205942        	Biomaterials-Based Approaches to Tumor Spheroid and Organoid Modeling.            	Evolving understanding of structural and biological complexity of tumors has stimulated development of physiologically relevant tumor models for cancer research and drug discovery. A major motivation for developing new tumor models is to recreate the 3D environment of tumors and context-mediated functional regulation of cancer cells. Such models overcome many limitations of standard monolayer cancer cell cultures. Under defined culture conditions, cancer cells self-assemble into 3D constructs known as spheroids. Additionally, cancer cells may recapitulate steps in embryonic development to self-organize into 3D cultures known as organoids. Importantly, spheroids and organoids reproduce morphology and biologic properties of tumors, providing valuable new tools for research, drug discovery, and precision medicine in cancer. This Progress Report discusses uses of both natural and synthetic biomaterials to culture cancer cells as spheroids or organoids, specifically highlighting studies that demonstrate how these models recapitulate key properties of native tumors. The report concludes with the perspectives on the utility of these models and areas of need for future developments to more closely mimic pathologic events in tumors.                © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

30637899        	Shortcuts to intestinal carcinogenesis by genetic engineering in organoids.            	Inactivation of the Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is an initiating and the most relevant event in most sporadic cases of colorectal cancer, providing a rationale for using Apc-mutant mice as the disease model. Whereas carcinogenesis has been observed only at the organism level, the recent development of the organoid culture technique has enabled long-term propagation of intestinal stem cells in a physiological setting, raising the possibility that organoids could serve as an alternative platform for modeling colon carcinogenesis. Indeed, it is demonstrated in the present study that lentivirus-based RNAi-mediated knockdown of Apc in intestinal organoids gave rise to subcutaneous tumors upon inoculation in immunodeficient mice. Reconstitution of common genetic aberrations in organoids resulted in development of various lesions, ranging from aberrant crypt foci to full-blown cancer, recapitulating multi-step colorectal tumorigenesis. Due to its simplicity and utility, similar organoid-based approaches have been applied to both murine and human cells in many investigations, to gain mechanistic insight into tumorigenesis, to validate putative tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes, and to establish preclinical models for drug discovery. In this review article, we provide a multifaceted overview of these types of approaches that will likely accelerate and advance research on colon cancer.                © 2019 The Authors.

32340843        	Patient-derived tumor organoid predicts drugs response in glioblastoma: A step forward in personalized cancer therapy?            	Despite significant medical advances, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a formidable therapeutic challenge. Advent of targeted capture sequencing and patients-derived organoid cultures may hold the key to scientifically sound individualized treatment approaches. We report on our initial experience of using the combination of these two technologies to create a tailored approach of systemic therapies for a patient with GBM, which challenges the conventional treatment paradigm, as well as specifically highlighting the complexities of such an approach and the potential for a more favorable treatment outcome.

32461556        	Assessing the origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer using CRISPR-modification of mouse organoids.            	High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC)-often referred to as a "silent killer"-is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The fallopian tube (murine oviduct) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) are considered the main candidate tissues of origin of this cancer. However, the relative contribution of each tissue to HG-SOC is not yet clear. Here, we establish organoid-based tumor progression models of HG-SOC from murine oviductal and OSE tissues. We use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce mutations into genes commonly found mutated in HG-SOC, such as Trp53, Brca1, Nf1 and Pten. Our results support the dual origin hypothesis of HG-SOC, as we demonstrate that both epithelia can give rise to ovarian tumors with high-grade pathology. However, the mutated oviductal organoids expand much faster in vitro and more readily form malignant tumors upon transplantation. Furthermore, in vitro drug testing reveals distinct lineage-dependent sensitivities to the common drugs used to treat HG-SOC in patients.	
29300390        	A surgical orthotopic organoid transplantation approach in mice to visualize and study colorectal cancer progression.            	Most currently available colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse models are not suitable for studying progression toward the metastatic stage. Recently, establishment of tumor organoid lines, either from murine CRC models or patients, and the possibility of engineering them with genome-editing technologies, have provided a large collection of tumor material faithfully recapitulating phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of native tumors. To study tumor progression in the natural in vivo environment, we developed an orthotopic approach based on transplantation of CRC organoids into the cecal epithelium. The 20-min procedure is described in detail here and enables growth of transplanted organoids into a single tumor mass within the intestinal tract. Due to long latency, tumor cells are capable of spreading through the blood circulation and forming metastases at distant sites. This method is designed to generate tumors suitable for studying CRC progression, thereby providing the opportunity to visualize tumor cell dynamics in vivo in real time by intravital microscopy.	
30265443        	Initiation, Expansion, and Cryopreservation of Human Primary Tissue-Derived Normal and Diseased Organoids in Embedded Three-Dimensional Culture.            	Organoids are primary patient-derived micro tissues grown within a three-dimensional extracellular matrix that better represents in vivo physiology and genetic diversity than existing two-dimensional cell lines. Organoids rely on the self-renewal and differentiation of tissue-resident stem cells that expand in culture and self-organize into complex three-dimensional structures. Depending on the tissue, organoids typically lack stromal, vascular, neural, and immune cells but otherwise can contain cells from all the respective tissue-specific cell lineages found in vivo. Established organoids can be initiated from cryopreserved material, cultured using largely traditional cell culture techniques and equipment, and then expanded and cryopreserved for future use. Organoid models have been developed from a variety of diseased and normal tissues including small intestine, colon, mammary, esophagus, lung, prostate, and pancreas. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.                © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	
25957691        	Prospective derivation of a living organoid biobank of colorectal cancer patients.            	In Rspondin-based 3D cultures, Lgr5 stem cells from multiple organs form ever-expanding epithelial organoids that retain their tissue identity. We report the establishment of tumor organoid cultures from 20 consecutive colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients. For most, organoids were also generated from adjacent normal tissue. Organoids closely recapitulate several properties of the original tumor. The spectrum of genetic changes within the "living biobank" agrees well with previous large-scale mutational analyses of CRC. Gene expression analysis indicates that the major CRC molecular subtypes are represented. Tumor organoids are amenable to high-throughput drug screens allowing detection of gene-drug associations. As an example, a single organoid culture was exquisitely sensitive to Wnt secretion (porcupine) inhibitors and carried a mutation in the negative Wnt feedback regulator RNF43, rather than in APC. Organoid technology may fill the gap between cancer genetics and patient trials, complement cell-line- and xenograft-based drug studies, and allow personalized therapy design.

29288005        	Ex vivo culture of tumor cells from N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced bladder cancer in rats: Development of organoids and an immortalized cell line.            	We ex vivo cultured primary tumor cells from N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced bladder tumors in rats and established an immortalized cell line from them.                Bladder tumors in rats were induced by instillation of MNU into the murine bladder. Primary tumor cells were prepared by the cancer-tissue originated spheroid method. An immortalized cell line was established by co-culture with fibroblasts. The cultured tumor cells were molecularly and functionally characterized by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, growth assay, and transwell migration assay.                Primary tumor cells were successfully prepared as multicellular spheroids from MNU-induced bladder tumors. The differentiation marker expression patterns observed in the original tumors were largely retained in the spheroids. We succeeded in establishing a cell line from the spheroids and named it T-MNU-1. Although basal markers (CK14 and CK5) were enriched in T-MNU-1 compared to the spheroids, T-MNU-1 expressed both luminal and basal markers. T-MNU-1 was able to migrate through a transwell.                Tumor cells in MNU-induced bladder tumors were successfully cultured ex vivo as organoids, and an immortalized cell line was also established from them. The ex vivo models offer a platform that enables analysis of intrinsic characteristics of tumor cells excluding influence of microenvironment in MNU-induced bladder tumors.

32065155        	Culture, Manipulation, and Orthotopic Transplantation of Mouse Bladder Tumor Organoids.            	The development of advanced tumor models has long been encouraged because current cancer models have shown limitations such as lack of three-dimensional (3D) tumor architecture and low relevance to human cancer. Researchers have recently developed a 3D in vitro cancer model referred to as tumor organoids that can mimic the characteristics of a native tumor in a culture dish. Here, experimental procedures are described in detail for the establishment of bladder tumor organoids from a carcinogen-induced murine bladder tumor, including culture, passage, and maintenance of the resulting 3D tumor organoids in vitro. In addition, protocols to manipulate the established bladder tumor organoid lines for genetic engineering using lentivirus-mediated transduction are described, including optimized conditions for the efficient introduction of new genetic elements into tumor organoids. Finally, the procedure for orthotopic transplantation of bladder tumor organoids into the wall of the murine bladder for further analysis is laid out. The methods described in this article can facilitate the establishment of an in vitro model for bladder cancer for the development of better therapeutic options.	
33238290        	Progenitor identification and SARS-CoV-2 infection in human distal lung organoids.            	The distal lung contains terminal bronchioles and alveoli that facilitate gas exchange. Three-dimensional in vitro human distal lung culture systems would strongly facilitate the investigation of pathologies such as interstitial lung disease, cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we describe the development of a long-term feeder-free, chemically defined culture system for distal lung progenitors as organoids derived from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids were able to differentiate into AT1 cells, and basal cell organoids developed lumens lined with differentiated club and ciliated cells. Single-cell analysis of KRT5+ cells in basal organoids revealed a distinct population of ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic cells, whose offspring further segregated into a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction that comprised about ten per cent of KRT5+ basal cells. This subpopulation formed clusters within terminal bronchioles and exhibited enriched clonogenic organoid growth activity. We created distal lung organoids with apical-out polarity to present ACE2 on the exposed external surface, facilitating infection of AT2 and basal cultures with SARS-CoV-2 and identifying club cells as a target population. This long-term, feeder-free culture of human distal lung organoids, coupled with single-cell analysis, identifies functional heterogeneity among basal cells and establishes a facile in vitro organoid model of human distal lung infections, including COVID-19-associated pneumonia.	
27233291        	Assay Establishment and Validation of a High-Throughput Screening Platform for Three-Dimensional Patient-Derived Colon Cancer Organoid Cultures.            	The application of patient-derived three-dimensional culture systems as disease-specific drug sensitivity models has enormous potential to connect compound screening and clinical trials. However, the implementation of complex cell-based assay systems in drug discovery requires reliable and robust screening platforms. Here we describe the establishment of an automated platform in 384-well format for three-dimensional organoid cultures derived from colon cancer patients. Single cells were embedded in an extracellular matrix by an automated workflow and subsequently self-organized into organoid structures within 4 days of culture before being exposed to compound treatment. We performed validation of assay robustness and reproducibility via plate uniformity and replicate-experiment studies. After assay optimization, the patient-derived organoid platform passed all relevant validation criteria. In addition, we introduced a streamlined plate uniformity study to evaluate patient-derived colon cancer samples from different donors. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using patient-derived tumor samples for high-throughput assays and their integration as disease-specific models in drug discovery.                 © 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.	
29181435        	Organoid culture of human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B.            	Organoids mimic the architecture and functions of a small organ. Organoid culture technique has been rapidly accepted by all research communities during the past decade to study stem cells, organ development and function, and patient-specific diseases. A protocol for organoid culture of human and mouse prostate epithelial and cancer tissues has been reported. However, organoid culture of the commonly used human prostate cancer cell lines has yet to be established. We followed the published protocol and performed organoid culture of LNCaP and C4-2B cells in MatrigelTM and organoid culture medium for 14 days. We found that both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines formed organoids that presented glandular structures. The cells within the organoids were androgen receptor-positive adenocarcinoma cells, but not p63-positive basal cells. The cells in the organoids responded to interleukin-17A treatment differently from the cells in the monolayer culture. The present study suggests that LNCaP and C4-2B cells are able to form organoids under the defined organoid culture conditions.	
33283409        	The epidermal growth factor receptor variant type III mutation frequently found in gliomas induces astrogenesis in human cerebral organoids.            	The epidermal growth factor receptor variant type III (EGFRvIII) is the most common mutation of EGFR in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and is found in approximately 25% of all GBMs. Intriguingly, EGFRvIII is mostly found in GFAP+ astrocytic tumour cells in the brain, suggesting connection of EGFRvIII to astrogenesis. In this study, we explored whether EGFRvIII mutation facilitates astrogenesis in human development setting.                Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated EGFRvIII mutations in H9-hESCs. Wild type (wt) H9-hESCs were used as an isogenic control. Next, we generated cerebral organoids using the wt and EGFRvIII-hESCs and examined the astrogenic differentiation of the brain organoids.                EGFRvIII-organoids showed abundant astrocytes (GFAP+ , S100β+ ), while no astrocytes were detected in wt hESC-derived organoids at day 49. On the contrary, TUJ1+ neurons were more abundant in the wt-organoids than the EGFRvIII-organoids. This result suggested that constitutively active EGFRvIII promoted astrogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis. In addition, the EGFRvIII-organoids were larger in size and retained more Ki67+ cells than wt-organoids, indicating enhanced cell proliferation by the mutation. The EGFRvIII-organoids displayed massive apoptotic cell death after treatment with temozolomide and hence, could be used for evaluation of anti-GBM drugs.                EGFRvIII mutation-induced astrogenesis and massive cell proliferation in a human brain development model. These results provide us new insights into the mechanisms relating EGFRvIII mutation-mediated gliogenesis and gliomagenesis.                © 2020 The Authors.

30550791        	Organoid Modeling of the Tumor Immune Microenvironment.            	In vitro cancer cultures, including three-dimensional organoids, typically contain exclusively neoplastic epithelium but require artificial reconstitution to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment (TME). The co-culture of primary tumor epithelia with endogenous, syngeneic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a cohesive unit has been particularly elusive. Here, an air-liquid interface (ALI) method propagated patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from >100 human biopsies or mouse tumors in syngeneic immunocompetent hosts as tumor epithelia with native embedded immune cells (T, B, NK, macrophages). Robust droplet-based, single-cell simultaneous determination of gene expression and immune repertoire indicated that PDO TILs accurately preserved the original tumor T cell receptor (TCR) spectrum. Crucially, human and murine PDOs successfully modeled immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with anti-PD-1- and/or anti-PD-L1 expanding and activating tumor antigen-specific TILs and eliciting tumor cytotoxicity. Organoid-based propagation of primary tumor epithelium en bloc with endogenous immune stroma should enable immuno-oncology investigations within the TME and facilitate personalized immunotherapy testing.

31978452        	A novel neuronal organoid model mimicking glioblastoma (GBM) features from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).            	Current experimental models using either human or mouse cell lines, are not representative of the complex features of GBM. In particular, there is no model to study patient-derived iPSCs to generate a GBM model. Overexpression of c-met gene is one of the molecular features of GBM leading to increased signaling via STAT3 phosphorylation. We generated an iPSC line from a patient with c-met mutation and we asked whether we could use it to generate neuronal-like organoids mimicking features of GBM.                We have generated iPSC-aggregates differentiating towards organoids. We analyzed them by gene expression profiling, immunostaining and transmission electronic microscopy analyses (TEM).                Herein we describe that c-met-mutated iPSC aggregates spontaneously differentiate into dopaminergic neurons more rapidly than control iPSC aggregates in culture. Gene expression profiling of c-met-mutated iPSC aggregates at day +90 showed neuronal- and GBM-related genes, reproducing a genomic network described in primary human GBM. Comparative TEM analyses confirmed the enrichment of these structures in intermediate filaments and abnormal cilia, a feature described in human GBM. The c-met-mutated iPSC-derived organoids, as compared to controls expressed high levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a typical marker of human GBM, as well as high levels of phospho-MET and phospho-STAT3. The use of temozolomide (TMZ) showed a preferential cytotoxicity of this drug in c-met-mutated neuronal-like organoids.                This study shows the feasibility of generating "off-the shelf" neuronal-like organoid model mimicking GBM using c-met-mutated iPSC aggregates and its potential future use in research.

29666172        	Genetic editing of colonic organoids provides a molecularly distinct and orthotopic preclinical model of serrated carcinogenesis.            	Serrated colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for approximately 25% of cases and includes tumours that are among the most treatment resistant and with worst outcomes. This CRC subtype is associated with activating mutations in the mitogen-activated kinase pathway gene, BRAF, and epigenetic modifications termed the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype, leading to epigenetic silencing of key tumour suppressor genes. It is still not clear which (epi-)genetic changes are most important in neoplastic progression and we begin to address this knowledge gap herein.                We use organoid culture combined with CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to sequentially introduce genetic alterations associated with serrated CRC and which regulate the stem cell niche, senescence and DNA mismatch repair.                Targeted biallelic gene alterations were verified by DNA sequencing. Organoid growth in the absence of niche factors was assessed, as well as analysis of downstream molecular pathway activity. Orthotopic engraftment of complex organoid lines, but not BrafV600E alone, quickly generated adenocarcinoma in vivo with serrated features consistent with human disease. Loss of the essential DNA mismatch repair enzyme, Mlh1, led to microsatellite instability. Sphingolipid metabolism genes are differentially regulated in both our mouse models of serrated CRC and human CRC, with key members of this pathway having prognostic significance in the human setting.                We generate rapid, complex models of serrated CRC to determine the contribution of specific genetic alterations to carcinogenesis. Analysis of our models alongside patient data has led to the identification of a potential susceptibility for this tumour type.                © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

30378047        	Generation and Culture of Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Organoids from Resected Tumor Specimens.            	The recent development of human organoids as patient-specific models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has helped set the stage for a new era of personalized medicine. Organoids can be generated from a resected PDA tumor in as little as 2-4 weeks, and are amenable to therapeutic screening as well as genetic and biochemical perturbation. Moreover, because these models promote the propagation of the neoplastic PDA cells at the expense of the stromal cells, transcriptome and genome-wide sequencing of organoids offers an unprecedented view of the genetic and expression changes occurring in the neoplastic cells of individual tumors. Here, we describe methods to generate PDA organoid cultures from resected human tumor specimens. We also describe how to propagate, cryopreserve, and thaw human PDA organoid cultures.	
32290033        	Ex Vivo Organoid Cultures Reveal the Importance of the Tumor Microenvironment for Maintenance of Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease, with varying clinical presentations and patient prognosis. Different molecular subgroups of CRC should be treated differently and therefore, must be better characterized. Organoid culture has recently been suggested as a good model to reflect the heterogeneous nature of CRC. However, organoid cultures cannot be established from all CRC tumors. The study examines which CRC tumors are more likely to generate organoids and thus benefit from ex vivo organoid drug testing. Long-term organoid cultures from 22 out of 40 CRC tumor specimens were established. It was found that organoid cultures were more difficult to establish from tumors characterized as microsatellite instable (MSI), BRAF-mutated, poorly differentiated and/or of a mucinous type. This suggests that patients with such tumors are less likely to benefit from ex vivo organoid drug testing, but it may also suggest biological difference in tumor growth. RNA sequencing analysis of tumor sections revealed that the in vivo maintenance of these non-organoid-forming tumors depends on factors related to inflammation and pathogen exposure. Furthermore, using TCGA data we could show a trend towards a worse prognosis for patients with organoid-forming tumors, suggesting also clinical differences. Results suggest that organoids are more difficult to establish from tumors characterized as MSI, BRAF-mutated, poorly differentiated and/or of a mucinous type. We further suggest that the maintenance of cell growth of these tumors in vivo may be promoted by immune-related factors and other stromal components within the tumor microenvironment.	
31317205        	Stem cells in tissues, organoids, and cancers.            	Stem cells give rise to all cells and build the tissue structures in our body, and heterogeneity and plasticity are the hallmarks of stem cells. Epigenetic modification, which is associated with niche signals, determines stem cell differentiation and somatic cell reprogramming. Stem cells play a critical role in the development of tumors and are capable of generating 3D organoids. Understanding the properties of stem cells will improve our capacity to maintain tissue homeostasis. Dissecting epigenetic regulation could be helpful for achieving efficient cell reprograming and for developing new drugs for cancer treatment. Stem cell-derived organoids open up new avenues for modeling human diseases and for regenerative medicine. Nevertheless, in addition to the achievements in stem cell research, many challenges still need to be overcome for stem cells to have versatile application in clinics.	
26896279        	A Three-Dimensional Organoid Culture System Derived from Human Glioblastomas Recapitulates the Hypoxic Gradients and Cancer Stem Cell Heterogeneity of Tumors Found In Vivo.            	Many cancers feature cellular hierarchies that are driven by tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (CSC) and rely on complex interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Standard cell culture conditions fail to recapitulate the original tumor architecture or microenvironmental gradients and are not designed to retain the cellular heterogeneity of parental tumors. Here, we describe a three-dimensional culture system that supports the long-term growth and expansion of tumor organoids derived directly from glioblastoma specimens, including patient-derived primary cultures, xenografts, genetically engineered glioma models, or patient samples. Organoids derived from multiple regions of patient tumors retain selective tumorigenic potential. Furthermore, organoids could be established directly from brain metastases not typically amenable to in vitro culture. Once formed, tumor organoids grew for months and displayed regional heterogeneity with a rapidly dividing outer region of SOX2(+), OLIG2(+), and TLX(+) cells surrounding a hypoxic core of primarily non-stem senescent cells and diffuse, quiescent CSCs. Notably, non-stem cells within organoids were sensitive to radiotherapy, whereas adjacent CSCs were radioresistant. Orthotopic transplantation of patient-derived organoids resulted in tumors displaying histologic features, including single-cell invasiveness, that were more representative of the parental tumor compared with those formed from patient-derived sphere cultures. In conclusion, we present a new ex vivo model in which phenotypically diverse stem and non-stem glioblastoma cell populations can be simultaneously cultured to explore new facets of microenvironmental influences and CSC biology.

30481551        	Bioengineering-inspired three-dimensional culture systems: Organoids to create tumor microenvironment.            	In recent years, in vitro three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems that better mimic in vivo physiology and tissue microenvironment have become important. It is used for the pre-clinical evaluation of the efficacy and safety profiles of new drug candidates developed especially for the treatment of various diseases including cancer. 3D cell culture techniques overcome the inadequacy of conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture models as they are much more informative than the 2D systems. And they can easily replace or reduce the number of in vivo studies which arise many ethical problems in the development of novel therapeutics. This review focuses on the organoid cultures which are 3D bioengineered cell culture systems that guide cell behavior and cell order to mimic in vivo tumor microenvironment.

28092415        	Cluster microRNAs miR-194 and miR-215 suppress the tumorigenicity of intestinal tumor organoids.            	Tumor stem cells with self-renewal and multipotent capacity play critical roles in the initiation and progression of cancer. Recently, a new 3-D culture system known as organoid culture has been developed, allowing Lgr5-positive stem cells to form organoids that resemble the properties of original tissues. Here we established organoids derived from intestinal tumors of Apcmin/+ mice and normal intestinal epithelia of C57BL/6J mice and investigated the roles of microRNA (miRNA) in intestinal tumor organoids. The results of microarray analyses revealed that expression of the cluster miRNAs, miR-194 and miR-215 was markedly suppressed in intestinal tumor organoids in comparison with organoids derived from normal intestinal epithelia. Enforced expression of miR-194 resulted in inhibition of E2f3, a positive regulator of the cell cycle and growth suppression of intestinal tumor organoids. In addition, enforced expression of miR-215 suppressed the cancer stem cell signature through downregulation of intestinal stem cell markers including Lgr5. These findings indicate that the miRNA cluster including miR-194 and miR-215 plays important roles in suppressing the growth and attenuating the stemness of intestinal tumor organoids.                © 2017 The Authors.

30842139        	Bladder Organoids and Spheroids: Potential Tools for Normal and Diseased Tissue Modelling.            	Bladder-related diseases are among the most common and costly to the healthcare system, and therefore require new approaches to treatment. Organoids and spheroids are 3D cultures that mimic organ features ex vivo and offer novel approaches for diagnostic and therapeutic assessment. The aim of this article was to provide a systematic review of the literature related to bladder organoids and spheroids, applied to disease diagnosis, characterization, and treatment. PubMed and Web of Science were utilized in March 2018 to compile 191 articles satisfying search criteria related to bladder organoids or spheroids and 58 articles were included in the final review. Finally, cell types and techniques utilized for spheroid and organoid manufacture were characterized. The applications of bladder carcinoma spheroids and organoids followed three themes: cancer characterization, diagnosis, and treatment. Tumor characterization studies included a focus on extracellular matrix, microenvironment, genetics, and growth of tumor cells. Diagnostic studies explored the use of endogenous fluorophores and white light for photodiagnosis. Treatment studies investigated cancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy, oncolytic viruses, and gene therapy. Ten studies explored hypericin as a tool for diagnostics and photodynamic therapy. Additionally, two studies applied organoids to urinary tract infections.                Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

28270604        	Genetic dissection of colorectal cancer progression by orthotopic transplantation of engineered cancer organoids.            	In the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, it is proposed that intestinal polyps evolve through a set of defined mutations toward metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we dissect this adenoma-carcinoma sequence in vivo by using an orthotopic organoid transplantation model of human colon organoids engineered to harbor different CRC mutation combinations. We demonstrate that sequential accumulation of oncogenic mutations in Wnt, EGFR, P53, and TGF-β signaling pathways facilitates efficient tumor growth, migration, and metastatic colonization. We show that reconstitution of specific niche signals can restore metastatic growth potential of tumor cells lacking one of the oncogenic mutations. Our findings imply that the ability to metastasize-i.e., to colonize distant sites-is the direct consequence of the loss of dependency on specific niche signals.	
31168097        	Individual brain organoids reproducibly form cell diversity of the human cerebral cortex.            	Experimental models of the human brain are needed for basic understanding of its development and disease1. Human brain organoids hold unprecedented promise for this purpose; however, they are plagued by high organoid-to-organoid variability2,3. This has raised doubts as to whether developmental processes of the human brain can occur outside the context of embryogenesis with a degree of reproducibility that is comparable to the endogenous tissue. Here we show that an organoid model of the dorsal forebrain can reliably generate a rich diversity of cell types appropriate for the human cerebral cortex. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of 166,242 cells isolated from 21 individual organoids, finding that 95% of the organoids generate a virtually indistinguishable compendium of cell types, following similar developmental trajectories and with a degree of organoid-to-organoid variability comparable to that of individual endogenous brains. Furthermore, organoids derived from different stem cell lines show consistent reproducibility in the cell types produced. The data demonstrate that reproducible development of the complex cellular diversity of the central nervous system does not require the context of the embryo, and that establishment of terminal cell identity is a highly constrained process that can emerge from diverse stem cell origins and growth environments.	
33057820        	Cancer research using organoid technology.            	Organoid technology has rapidly transformed basic biomedical research and contributed to significant discoveries in the last decade. With the application of protocols to generate organoids from cancer tissue, organoid technology has opened up new opportunities for cancer research and therapy. Using organoid cultures derived from healthy tissues, different aspects of tumour initiation and progression are widely studied including the role of pathogens or specific cancer genes. Cancer organoid cultures, on the other hand, are applied to generate biobanks, perform drug screens, and study mutational signatures. With the incorporation of cellular components of the tumour microenvironment such as immune cells into the organoid cultures, the technology is now also exploited in the rapidly advancing field of immuno-oncology. In this review, I discuss how organoid technology is currently being utilised in cancer research and what obstacles are still to be overcome for its broader use in anti-cancer therapy.	
31883794        	A Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Organoid Model and Biobank Recapitulates Inter- and Intra-tumoral Heterogeneity.            	Glioblastomas exhibit vast inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, complicating the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Current in vitro models are limited in preserving the cellular and mutational diversity of parental tumors and require a prolonged generation time. Here, we report methods for generating and biobanking patient-derived glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) that recapitulate the histological features, cellular diversity, gene expression, and mutational profiles of their corresponding parental tumors. GBOs can be generated quickly with high reliability and exhibit rapid, aggressive infiltration when transplanted into adult rodent brains. We further demonstrate the utility of GBOs to test personalized therapies by correlating GBO mutational profiles with responses to specific drugs and by modeling chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy. Our studies show that GBOs maintain many key features of glioblastomas and can be rapidly deployed to investigate patient-specific treatment strategies. Additionally, our live biobank establishes a rich resource for basic and translational glioblastoma research.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
31339921        	A more physiological approach to lipid metabolism alterations in cancer: CRC-like organoids assessment.            	Precision medicine might be the response to the recent questioning of the use of metformin as an anticancer drug in colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, in order to establish properly its benefits, metformin application needs to be assayed on the different progression stages of CRC. In this way, intestinal organoids imply a more physiological tool, representing a new therapeutic opportunity for CRC personalized treatment to assay tumor stage-dependent drugs. The previously reported lipid metabolism-related axis, Acyl-CoA synthetases/ Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (ACSLs/SCD), stimulates colon cancer progression and metformin is able to rescue the invasive and migratory phenotype conferred to cancer cells upon this axis overexpression. Therefore, we checked ACSL/SCD axis status, its regulatory miRNAs and the effect of metformin treatment in intestinal organoids with the most common acquired mutations in a sporadic CRC (CRC-like organoids) as a model for specific and personalized treatment. Despite ACSL4 expression is upregulated progressively in CRC-like organoids, metformin is able to downregulate its expression, especially in the first two stages (I, II). Besides, organoids are clearly more sensitive in the first stage (Apc mutated) to metformin than current chemotherapeutic drugs such as fluorouracil (5-FU). Metformin performs an independent "Warburg effect" blockade to cancer progression and is able to reduce crypt stem cell markers expression such as LGR5+. These results suggest a putative increased efficiency of the use of metformin in early stages of CRC than in advanced disease.	
30844513        	Organoid models for translational pancreatic cancer research.            	Despite recent advances in the treatment of cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) still retains the worst survival rate of common malignancies. Late diagnosis and lack of curative therapeutic options are the most pressing clinical problems for this disease. Therefore, there is a need for patient models and biomarkers that can be applied in the clinic to identify the most effective therapy for a patient. Pancreatic ductal organoids are ex-vivo models of PDAC that can be established from very small biopsies, enabling the study of localized, advanced, and metastatic patients. Organoids models have been applied to pancreatic cancer research and offer a promising platform for precision medicine approaches.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	
28394884        	Long-term, hormone-responsive organoid cultures of human endometrium in a chemically defined medium.            	In humans, the endometrium, the uterine mucosal lining, undergoes dynamic changes throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Despite the importance of the endometrium as the site of implantation and nutritional support for the conceptus, there are no long-term culture systems that recapitulate endometrial function in vitro. We adapted conditions used to establish human adult stem-cell-derived organoid cultures to generate three-dimensional cultures of normal and decidualized human endometrium. These organoids expand long-term, are genetically stable and differentiate following treatment with reproductive hormones. Single cells from both endometrium and decidua can generate a fully functional organoid. Transcript analysis confirmed great similarity between organoids and the primary tissue of origin. On exposure to pregnancy signals, endometrial organoids develop characteristics of early pregnancy. We also derived organoids from malignant endometrium, and so provide a foundation to study common diseases, such as endometriosis and endometrial cancer, as well as the physiology of early gestation.	
31631019        	Improved Retinal Organoid Differentiation by Modulating Signaling Pathways Revealed by Comparative Transcriptome Analyses with Development In Vivo.            	Stem cell-derived retinal organoids recapitulate many landmarks of in vivo differentiation but lack functional maturation of distinct cell types, especially photoreceptors. Using comprehensive temporal transcriptome analyses, we show that transcriptome shift from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P10, associated with morphogenesis and synapse formation during mouse retina development, was not evident in organoids, and co-expression clusters with similar patterns included different sets of genes. Furthermore, network analysis identified divergent regulatory dynamics between developing retina in vivo and in organoids, with temporal dysregulation of specific signaling pathways and delayed or reduced expression of genes involved in photoreceptor function(s) and survival. Accordingly, addition of docosahexaenoic acid and fibroblast growth factor 1 to organoid cultures specifically promoted the maturation of photoreceptors, including cones. Our study thus identifies regulatory signals deficient in developing retinal organoids and provides experimental validation by producing a more mature retina in vitro, thereby facilitating investigations in disease modeling and therapies.

30003451        	Development of Patient-Derived Gastric Cancer Organoids from Endoscopic Biopsies and Surgical Tissues.            	Organoids are three-dimensional in vitro models of human disease developed from benign and malignant gastrointestinal tissues with tremendous potential for personalized medicine applications. We sought to determine whether gastric cancer patient-derived organoids (PDOs) could be safely established from endoscopic biopsies for rapid drug screening.                Patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for surveillance or staging and had additional forceps biopsies taken for PDO creation. Cancer tissues from operative specimens were also used to create PDOs. To address potential tumor heterogeneity, we performed low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of endoscopic-derived PDOs with paired surgical PDOs and whole-tumor lysates. The stability of genomic alterations in endoscopic organoids was assessed by next-generation sequencing and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The feasibility and potential accuracy of drug sensitivity screening with endoscopic-derived PDOs were also evaluated.                Gastric cancer PDOs (n = 15) were successfully established from EGD forceps biopsies (n = 8) and surgical tissues (n = 7) from five patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. Low-coverage whole-genomic profiling of paired EGD and surgical PDOs along with whole-tumor lysates demonstrated absence of tumor heterogeneity. Nested PCR assay identified similar KRAS alterations in primary tumor and paired organoids. Drug sensitivity testing of endoscopic-derived PDOs displayed standard dose-response curves to current gastric cancer cytotoxic therapies.                Our study results demonstrate the feasibility of developing gastric cancer PDOs from EGD biopsies. These results also indicate that endoscopic-derived PDOs are accurate surrogates of the primary tumor and have the potential for drug sensitivity screening and personalized medicine applications.	
32354986        	In Vivo Assessment of Size-Selective Glomerular Sieving in Transplanted Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Kidney Organoids.            	The utility of kidney organoids in regenerative medicine will rely on the functionality of the glomerular and tubular structures in these tissues. Recent studies have demonstrated the vascularization and subsequent maturation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids after renal subcapsular transplantation. This raises the question of whether the glomeruli also become functional upon transplantation.                We transplanted kidney organoids under the renal capsule of the left kidney in immunodeficient mice followed by the implantation of a titanium imaging window on top of the kidney organoid. To assess glomerular function in the transplanted human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney tissue 1, 2, and 3 weeks after transplantation, we applied high-resolution intravital multiphoton imaging through the imaging window during intravenous infusion of fluorescently labeled low and high molecular mass dextran molecules or albumin.                After vascularization, glomerular structures in the organoid displayed dextran and albumin size selectivity across their glomerular filtration barrier. We also observed evidence of proximal tubular dextran reuptake.                Our results demonstrate that human pluripotent stem cell-derived glomeruli can develop an appropriate barrier function and discriminate between molecules of varying size. These characteristics together with tubular presence of low molecular mass dextran provide clear evidence of functional filtration. This approach to visualizing glomerular filtration function will be instrumental for translation of organoid technology for clinical applications as well as for disease modeling.

30735176        	Handling and Assessment of Human Primary Prostate Organoid Culture.            	This paper describes a detailed protocol for three-dimensional (3D) culturing, handling, and evaluation of human primary prostate organoids. The process involves seeding of epithelial cells sparsely in a 3D matrix gel on a 96-well microplate with media changes to cultivate expansion into organoids. Morphology is then assessed by whole-well capturing of z-stack images. Compression of z-stacks creates a single in-focus image from which organoids are measured to quantify a variety of outputs, including circularity, roundness, and area.DNA, RNA, and protein can be collected from organoids recovered from the matrix gel. Cell populations of interest can be assessed by organoid dissociation and flow cytometry. Formalin-fixation-paraffin-embedding (FFPE) followed by sectioning is used for the histological assessment and antibody staining. Whole-mount immunofluorescent staining preserves organoid morphology and facilitates observation of protein localization in organoids in situ. Commercial assays that are traditionally used for 2D monolayer cells can be modified for 3D organoids. Used together, the techniques in this protocol provide a robust toolbox to quantify prostate organoid growth, morphologic characteristics, and expression of differentiation markers.	
31305527        	Human Neural Organoids for Studying Brain Cancer and Neurodegenerative Diseases.            	The lack of relevant in vitro neural models is an important obstacle on medical progress for neuropathologies. Establishment of relevant cellular models is crucial both to better understand the pathological mechanisms of these diseases and identify new therapeutic targets and strategies. To be pertinent, an in vitro model must reproduce the pathological features of a human disease. However, in the context of neurodegenerative disease, a relevant in vitro model should provide neural cell replacement as a valuable therapeutic opportunity. Such a model would not only allow screening of therapeutic molecules but also can be used to optimize neural protocol differentiation [for example, in the context of transplantation in Parkinson's disease (PD)]. This study describes two in vitro protocols of 1) human glioblastoma development within a human neural organoids (NO) and 2) neuron dopaminergic (DA) differentiation generating a three-dimensional (3D) organoid. For this purpose, a well-standardized protocol was established that allows the production of size-calibrated neurospheres derived from human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation. The first model can be used to reveal molecular and cellular events occurring during in glioblastoma development within the neural organoid, while the DA organoid not only represents a suitable source of DA neurons for cell therapy in Parkinson's disease but also can be used for drug testing.	
30515709        	A reproducible scaffold-free 3D organoid model to study neoplastic progression in breast cancer.            	While 3D cellular models are useful to study biological processes, gel-embedded organoids have large variability. This paper describes high-yield production of large (~1 mm diameter), scaffold-free, highly-spherical organoids in a one drop-one organoid format using MCF10A cells, a non-tumorigenic breast cell line. These organoids display a hollow lumen and secondary acini, and express mammary gland-specific and progenitor markers, resembling normal human breast acini. When subjected to treatment with TGF-β, the hypoxia-mimetic reagent CoCl2, or co-culture with mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC), the organoids increase collagen I production and undergo large phenotypic and morphological changes of neoplastic progression, which were reproducible and quantifiable. Advantages of this scaffold-free, 3D breast organoid model include high consistency and reproducibility, ability to measure cellular collagen I production without noise from exogenous collagen, and capacity to subject the organoid to various stimuli from the microenvironment and exogenous treatments with precise timing without concern of matrix binding. Using this system, we generated organoids from primary metaplastic mammary carcinomas of MMTV-Cre;Ccn6fl/fl mice, which retained the high grade spindle cell morphology of the primary tumors. The platform is envisioned to be useful as a standardized 3D cellular model to study how microenvironmental factors influence breast tumorigenesis, and to potential therapeutics.	
28099487        	Metabolic Imaging of Head and Neck Cancer Organoids.            	Head and neck cancer patients suffer from toxicities, morbidities, and mortalities, and these ailments could be minimized through improved therapies. Drug discovery is a long, expensive, and complex process, so optimized assays can improve the success rate of drug candidates. This study applies optical imaging of cell metabolism to three-dimensional in vitro cultures of head and neck cancer grown from primary tumor tissue (organoids). This technique is advantageous because it measures cell metabolism using intrinsic fluorescence from NAD(P)H and FAD on a single cell level for a three-dimensional in vitro model. Head and neck cancer organoids are characterized alone and after treatment with standard therapies, including an antibody therapy, a chemotherapy, and combination therapy. Additionally, organoid cellular heterogeneity is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Gold standard measures of treatment response, including cell proliferation, cell death, and in vivo tumor volume, validate therapeutic efficacy for each treatment group in a parallel study. Results indicate that optical metabolic imaging is sensitive to therapeutic response in organoids after 1 day of treatment (p<0.05) and resolves cell subpopulations with distinct metabolic phenotypes. Ultimately, this platform could provide a sensitive high-throughput assay to streamline the drug discovery process for head and neck cancer.	
30893594        	Modeling Patient-Derived Glioblastoma with Cerebral Organoids.            	The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) remains dismal, with a median survival of approximately 15 months. Current preclinical GBM models are limited by the lack of a "normal" human microenvironment and the inability of many tumor cell lines to accurately reproduce GBM biology. To address these limitations, we have established a model system whereby we can retro-engineer patient-specific GBMs using patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cerebral organoids. Our cerebral organoid glioma (GLICO) model shows that GSCs home toward the human cerebral organoid and deeply invade and proliferate within the host tissue, forming tumors that closely phenocopy patient GBMs. Furthermore, cerebral organoid tumors form rapidly and are supported by an interconnected network of tumor microtubes that aids in the invasion of normal host tissue. Our GLICO model provides a system for modeling primary human GBM ex vivo and for high-throughput drug screening.                Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

33116299        	Identification of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using lung and colonic organoids.            	There is an urgent need to create novel models using human disease-relevant cells to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biology and to facilitate drug screening. Here, as SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-LOs). The hPSC-LOs (particularly alveolar type-II-like cells) are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and showed robust induction of chemokines following SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. Nearly 25% of these patients also have gastrointestinal manifestations, which are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. We therefore also generated complementary hPSC-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the response of colonic cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that multiple colonic cell types, especially enterocytes, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using hPSC-LOs, we performed a high-throughput screen of drugs approved by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, including imatinib, mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride. Treatment at physiologically relevant levels of these drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of both hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs infected by SARS-CoV-2 can serve as disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a valuable resource for drug screening to identify candidate COVID-19 therapeutics.	
27632571        	FGF2 and EGF Are Required for Self-Renewal and Organoid Formation of Canine Normal and Tumor Breast Stem Cells.            	Recent studies suggest that human tumors are generated from cancer cells with stem cell (SC) properties. Spontaneously occurring cancers in dogs contain a diversity of cells that like for human tumors suggest that certain canine tumors are also generated from cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs, like normal SCs, have the capacity for self-renewal as mammospheres in suspension cultures. To understand how cells with SC properties contribute to canine mammary gland tumor development and progression, comparative analysis between normal SCs and CSCs, obtained from the same individual, is essential. We have utilized the property of sphere formation to develop culture conditions for propagating stem/progenitor cells from canine normal and tumor tissue. We show that cells from dissociated mammospheres retain sphere reformation capacity for several serial passages and have the capacity to generate organoid structures ex situ. Utilizing various culture conditions for passaging SCs and CSCs, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were found to positively or negatively regulate mammosphere regeneration, organoid formation, and multi-lineage differentiation potential. The response of FGF2 and EGF on SCs and CSCs was different, with increased FGF2 and EGF self-renewal promoted in SCs and repressed in CSCs. Our protocol for propagating SCs from normal and tumor canine breast tissue will provide new opportunities in comparative mammary gland stem cell analysis between species and anticancer treatment and therapies for dogs.

30144514        	Modeling Wnt signaling by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing recapitulates neoplasia in human Barrett epithelial organoids.            	Primary organoid cultures generated from patient biopsies comprise a novel improved platform for disease modeling, being genetically stable and closely recapitulating in vivo scenarios. Barrett esophagus (BE) is the major risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. There has been a dearth of long-term in vitro expansion models of BE neoplastic transformation. We generated a long-term virus-free organoid expansion model of BE neoplasia from patient biopsies. Both wild-type and paired APC-knockout (APCKO) BE organoids genome-edited by CRISPR-Cas9 showed characteristic goblet cell differentiation. Autonomous Wnt activation was confirmed in APCKO organoids by overexpression of Wnt target genes and nuclear-translocated β-catenin expression after withdrawal of Wnt-3A and R-spondin-1. Wnt-activated organoids demonstrated histologic atypia, higher proliferative and replicative activity, reduced apoptosis, and prolonged culturability. Wnt-activated organoids also showed sustained protrusive migration ability accompanied by disrupted basement membrane reorganization and integrity. This CRISPR-Cas9 editing human-derived organoid model recapitulates the critical role of aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation in BE neoplastic transformation. This system can be used to study other 'driver' pathway alterations in BE-associated neoplasia, avoiding signaling noise present in immortalized or cancer-derived cell lines.

24657539        	Organoid cultures for the analysis of cancer phenotypes.            	Preclinical models of cancer are essential for a basic understanding of cancer biology and its translation into efficient treatment options for affected patients. Cancer cell lines and xenografts derived directly from primary human tumors have proven very valuable in fundamental oncology research and anticancer drug discovery. Both models inherently comprise advantages and caveats that have to be accounted for. We will outline in these and discuss primary patient derived organoids as third preclinical cancer model. We propose that cancer organoids could potentially fill the gap between simple cancer cell lines suitable for high-throughput screens and complicated, but physiologically relevant xenografts. The resulting applications for cancer organoids range from basic research to drug screens and patient stratification.                 Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	
30476497        	Modeling Human Digestive Diseases With CRISPR-Cas9-Modified Organoids.            	Insights into the stem cell niche have allowed researchers to cultivate adult tissue stem cells as organoids that display structural and phenotypic features of healthy and diseased epithelial tissues. Organoids derived from patients' tissues are used as models of disease and to test drugs. CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be used to genetically engineer organoids for studies of monogenic diseases and cancer. We review the derivation of organoids from human gastrointestinal tissues and how CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be used to study these organoids. We discuss burgeoning technologies that are broadening our understanding of diseases of the digestive system.                Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

31776328        	Graft immaturity and safety concerns in transplanted human kidney organoids.            	For chronic kidney disease, regeneration of lost nephrons with human kidney organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells is proposed to be an attractive potential therapeutic option. It remains unclear, however, whether organoids transplanted into kidneys in vivo would be safe or functional. Here, we purified kidney organoids and transplanted them beneath the kidney capsules of immunodeficient mice to test their safety and maturity. Kidney organoid grafts survived for months after transplantation and became vascularized from host mouse endothelial cells. Nephron-like structures in grafts appeared more mature than kidney organoids in vitro, but remained immature compared with the neighboring mouse kidney tissue. Ultrastructural analysis revealed filtration barrier-like structures, capillary lumens, and tubules with brush border in the transplanted kidney organoids, which were more mature than those of the kidney organoids in vitro but not as organized as adult mammalian kidneys. Immaturity was a common feature of three separate differentiation protocols by immunofluorescence analysis and single cell RNA sequencing. Stroma of transplanted kidney organoid grafts were filled with vimentin-positive mesenchymal cells, and chondrogenesis, cystogenesis, and stromal expansion were observed in the long term. Transcription profiles showed that long-term maintenance after kidney organoid transplantation induced transcriptomic reprogramming with prominent suppression of cell-cycle-related genes and upregulation of extracellular matrix organization. Our data suggest that kidney organoids derived from iPS cells may be transplantable but strategies to improve nephron differentiation and purity are required before they can be applied in humans as a therapeutic option.	
27993977        	Derivation of a robust mouse mammary organoid system for studying tissue dynamics.            	Advances in stem cell research have enabled the generation of 'mini organs' or organoids that recapitulate phenotypic traits of the original biological specimen. Although organoids have been demonstrated for multiple organ systems, there are more limited options for studying mouse mammary gland formation in vitro Here, we have built upon previously described culture assays to define culture conditions that enable the efficient generation of clonal organoid structures from single sorted basal mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Analysis of Confetti-reporter mice revealed the formation of uni-colored structures and thus the clonal nature of these organoids. High-resolution 3D imaging demonstrated that basal cell-derived complex organoids comprised an inner compartment of polarized luminal cells with milk-producing capacity and an outer network of elongated myoepithelial cells. Conversely, structures generated from luminal MECs rarely contained basal/myoepithelial cells. Moreover, flow cytometry and 3D microscopy of organoids generated from lineage-specific reporter mice established the bipotent capacity of basal cells and the restricted potential of luminal cells. In summary, we describe optimized in vitro conditions for the efficient generation of mouse mammary organoids that recapitulate features of mammary tissue architecture and function, and can be applied to understand tissue dynamics and cell-fate decisions.                © 2017.

31259888        	Generation of Tumor Organoids from Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of Prostate Cancer.            	Methods based on homologous recombination to modify genes have significantly furthered biological research. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are a rigorous method for studying mammalian development and disease. Our laboratory has developed several GEMMs of prostate cancer (PCa) that lack expression of one or multiple tumor suppressor genes using the site-specific Cre-loxP recombinase system and a prostate-specific promoter. In this article, we describe our method for necropsy of these PCa GEMMs, primarily focusing on dissection of mouse prostate tumors. New methods developed over the last decade have facilitated the culture of epithelial-derived cells to model organ systems in vitro in three dimensions. We also detail a 3D cell culture method to generate tumor organoids from mouse PCa GEMMs. Pre-clinical cancer research has been dominated by 2D cell culture and cell line-derived or patient-derived xenograft models. These methods lack tumor microenvironment, a limitation of using these techniques in pre-clinical studies. GEMMs are more physiologically-relevant for understanding tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Tumor organoid culture is an in vitro model system that recapitulates tumor architecture and cell lineage characteristics. In addition, 3D cell culture methods allow for growth of normal cells for comparison to tumor cell cultures, rarely possible using 2D cell culture techniques. In combination, use of GEMMs and 3D cell culture in pre-clinical studies has the potential to improve our understanding of cancer biology.	
30067989        	Organoid Models of Human Liver Cancers Derived from Tumor Needle Biopsies.            	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only treatment option for advanced HCC. Due to tumor heterogeneity, its efficacy greatly varies between patients and is limited due to adverse effects and drug resistance. Current in vitro models fail to recapitulate key features of HCCs. We report the generation of long-term organoid cultures from tumor needle biopsies of HCC patients with various etiologies and tumor stages. HCC organoids retain the morphology as well as the expression pattern of HCC tumor markers and preserve the genetic heterogeneity of the originating tumors. In a proof-of-principle study, we show that liver cancer organoids can be used to test sensitivity to sorafenib. In conclusion, organoid models can be derived from needle biopsies of liver cancers and provide a tool for developing tailored therapies.                Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

31703723        	Organoids of epithelial ovarian cancer as an emerging preclinical in vitro tool: a review.            	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains the most lethal gynecological cancer in developed countries, indicating the need for further research. Although current cancer models prove useful, they have major limitations. Organoids, a novel in vitro 3D cell culture technique, derived from stem cells, could provide a bridge between the current preclinical platforms. However, this technique is still in its early stages. After conducting a systematic literature search, only sixteen manuscripts concerning ovarian related organoids could be retrieved.In this review, we discuss current tumor models, including organoids and provide a comprehensive review about organoids of ovarian tissue. Potential future applications are addressed, proving organoids to be an interesting platform for modeling tumorigenesis, drug testing and screening and other applications. Recent advancements could usher in a new era of highly personalized medicine in EOC.	
31233118        	Organoid-based ex vivo reconstitution of Kras-driven pancreatic ductal carcinogenesis.            	The organoid culture technique has been recently applied to modeling carcinogenesis in several organs. To further explore its potential and gain novel insights into tumorigenesis, we here investigated whether pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) could be generated as subcutaneous tumors in immunocompromised nude mice, by genetic engineering of normal organoids. As expected, acute induction of KrasG12Din vitro occasionally led to development of tiny nodules compatible with early lesions known as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). KrasG12D-expressing cells were enriched after inoculation in the subcutis, yet proved rather declined during culture, suggesting that its advantage might depend on surrounding environments. Depletion of growth factors or concurrent Trp53 deletion resulted in its robust enrichment, invariably leading to development of PanIN or large high-grade adenocarcinoma, respectively, consistent with in vivo mouse studies for the same genotype. Progression from PanIN was also recapitulated by subsequent knockdown of common tumor suppressors, whereas the impact of Tgfbr2 deletion was only partially recapitulated, illustrating genotype-dependent requirement of the pancreatic niche for tumorigenesis. Intriguingly, analysis of tumor-derived organoids revealed that KrasG12D-expressing cells with spontaneous deletion of wild-type Kras were positively selected and exhibited an aging-related mutation signature in nude mice, mirroring the pathogenesis of human PDA, and that the sphere-forming potential and orthotopic tumorigenicity in syngenic mice were significantly augmented. These observations highlighted the relevance of the subcutis of nude mice in promoting PDA development despite its ectopic nature. Taken together, pancreatic carcinogenesis could be considerably recapitulated with organoids, which would probably serve as a novel disease model.                © The Author(s) 2019.

33077832        	Automated microfluidic platform for dynamic and combinatorial drug screening of tumor organoids.            	Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture technologies, such as organoids, are physiologically relevant models for basic and clinical applications. Automated microfluidics offers advantages in high-throughput and precision analysis of cells but is not yet compatible with organoids. Here, we present an automated, high-throughput, microfluidic 3D organoid culture and analysis system to facilitate preclinical research and personalized therapies. Our system provides combinatorial and dynamic drug treatments to hundreds of cultures and enables real-time analysis of organoids. We validate our system by performing individual, combinatorial, and sequential drug screens on human-derived pancreatic tumor organoids. We observe significant differences in the response of individual patient-based organoids to drug treatments and find that temporally-modified drug treatments can be more effective than constant-dose monotherapy or combination therapy in vitro. This integrated platform advances organoids models to screen and mirror real patient treatment courses with potential to facilitate treatment decisions for personalized therapy.	figshare                                            10.6084/m9.figshare.12424673                        10.6084/m9.figshare.12424733
33106923        	Optimal, Large-Scale Propagation of Mouse Mammary Tumor Organoids.            	Tumor organoids mimic the architecture and heterogeneity of in vivo tumors and enable studies of collective interactions between tumor cells as well as with their surrounding microenvironment. Although tumor organoids hold significant promise as cancer models, they are also more costly and labor-intensive to cultivate than traditional 2D cell culture. We sought to identify critical factors regulating organoid growth ex vivo, and to use these observations to develop a more efficient organoid expansion method. Using time-lapse imaging of mouse mammary tumor organoids in 3D culture, we observed that outgrowth potential varies non-linearly with initial organoid size. Maximal outgrowth occurred in organoids with a starting size between ~10 to 1000 cells. Based on these observations, we developed a suspension culture method that maintains organoids in the ideal size range, enabling expansion from 1 million to over 100 million cells in less than 2 weeks and less than 3 hours of hands-on time. Our method facilitates the rapid, cost-effective expansion of organoids for CRISPR based studies and other assays requiring a large amount of organoid starting material.	
29425513        	Specific Labeling of Stem Cell Activity in Human Colorectal Organoids Using an ASCL2-Responsive Minigene.            	Organoid technology provides the possibility of culturing patient-derived colon tissue and colorectal cancers (CRCs) while maintaining all functional and phenotypic characteristics. Labeling stem cells, especially in normal and benign tumor organoids of human colon, is challenging and therefore limits maximal exploitation of organoid libraries for human stem cell research. Here, we developed STAR (stem cell Ascl2 reporter), a minimal enhancer/promoter element that reports transcriptional activity of ASCL2, a master regulator of LGR5+ intestinal stem cells. Using lentiviral infection, STAR drives specific expression in stem cells of normal organoids and in multiple engineered and patient-derived CRC organoids of different genetic makeup. STAR reveals that differentiation hierarchies and the potential for cell fate plasticity are present at all stages of human CRC development. Organoid technology, in combination with the user-friendly nature of STAR, will facilitate basic research into human adult stem cell biology.                Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

26721435        	Organoids as a model system for studying human lung development and disease.            	The lung is a complex organ comprising multiple cell types that perform a variety of vital processes, including immune defense and gas exchange. Diseases of the lung, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and lung cancer, together represent one of the largest causes of patient suffering and mortality. Logistical barriers that hamper access to embryonic, normal adult or diseased lung tissue currently hinder the study of lung disease. In vitro lung modeling represents an attractive and accessible avenue for investigating lung development, function and disease pathology, but accurately modeling the lung in vitro requires a system that recapitulates the structural features of the native lung. Organoids are stem cell-derived three-dimensional structures that are supported by an extracellular matrix and contain multiple cell types whose spatial arrangement and interactions mimic those of the native organ. Recently, organoids representative of the respiratory system have been generated from adult lung stem cells and human pluripotent stem cells. Ongoing studies are showing that organoids may be used to model human lung development, and can serve as a platform for interrogating the function of lung-related genes and signalling pathways. In a therapeutic context, organoids may be used for modeling lung diseases, and as a platform for screening for drugs that alleviate respiratory disease. Here, we summarize the organoid-forming capacity of respiratory cells, current lung organoid technologies and their potential use in future therapeutic applications.

31406042        	[Study on colorectal cancer using air-liquid interface organoid culture method].            	Colorectal cancer is a disease with high unmet medical needs. An increase in the number of cancer patients who are resistant to anti-cancer drugs is one of factors that increase the number of fatalities. Since there was no suitable experimental model to recapitulate the tumor environment in which various cells in the tissues exist, it was extremely difficult to develop a medicine that overcomes the anti-cancer drug resistance in each colorectal cancer patient. In this review, we describe the current status and problems of drug therapy for colorectal cancer patients, and introduce our study to develop the new targeting drugs using human colon tissue-derived air liquid interface organoid culture method.	
32612367        	The Anti-Tumor Effect of Nab-Paclitaxel Proven by Patient-Derived Organoids.            	Nab-paclitaxel has been widely used in treating breast cancer and pancreatic patients for its low toxicity and high efficiency. However, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains ambiguous. The aim of our study was to test the anti-tumor activity of nab-paclitaxel using GC patient-derived organoids.                By using the organoid culture system, we describe the establishment of human gastric cancer organoid lines from surgical samples of three patients with gastric cancer. The consistency of these organoids with original cancer tissues was evaluated by histopathological examination. The characteristics of the cancer organoids were tested using immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Using organoids, the anti-tumor efficiencies of nab-paclitaxel, 5-Fu and epirubicin were compared by CCK8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining.                Three organoids were successfully established and passaged. The morphology of the established GC organoids was consistent with original cancer tissues. The IC50 of nab-paclitaxel was 3.68 μmol/L in hGCO1, 2.41 μmol/L in hGCO2 and 2.91 μmol/L in hGCO3, which was significantly lower than those of 5-FU (72.99 μmol/L in hGCO1, 28.32 μmol/L in hGCO2 and 2.91 μmol/L in hGCO3) and epirubicin (25.85μmol/L in hGCO1, 15.15 μmol/L in hGCO2 and 7.60 μmol/L in hGCO3). When each organoid lines were treated with nab-paclitaxel for increasing period of time, the percentage of the apoptotic cells in each organoid increased accordingly.                Nab-paclitaxel showed strong anti-tumor activity and had the potential to become front-line drug for treating GC patients. Gastric cancer organoid may be a good tool to predict in vivo response to drugs.                © 2020 Xiao et al.	
28672397        	Structural and Functional Characterization of Human Stem-Cell-Derived Retinal Organoids by Live Imaging.            	Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal organoids are a platform for investigating retinal development, pathophysiology, and cellular therapies. In contrast to histologic analysis in which multiple specimens fixed at different times are used to reconstruct developmental processes, repeated analysis of the same living organoids provides a more direct means to characterize changes. New live imaging modalities can provide insights into retinal organoid structure and metabolic function during in vitro growth. This study employed live tissue imaging to characterize retinal organoid development, including metabolic changes accompanying photoreceptor differentiation.                Live hPSC-derived retinal organoids at different developmental stages were examined for microanatomic organization and metabolic function by phase contrast microscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and hyperspectral imaging (HSpec). Features were compared to those revealed by histologic staining, immunostaining, and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) of fixed organoid tissue.                We used FLIM and HSpec to detect changes in metabolic activity as organoids differentiated into organized lamellae. FLIM detected increased glycolytic activity and HSpec detected retinol and retinoic acid accumulation in the organoid outer layer, coinciding with photoreceptor genesis. OCT enabled imaging of lamellae formed during organoid maturation. Micro-CT revealed three-dimensional structure, but failed to detect lamellae.                Live imaging modalities facilitate real-time and nondestructive imaging of retinal organoids as they organize into lamellar structures. FLIM and HSpec enable rapid detection of lamellar structure and photoreceptor metabolism. Live imaging techniques may aid in the continuous evaluation of retinal organoid development in diverse experimental and cell therapy settings.	
32117908        	Prioritizing Gene Cascading Paths to Model Colorectal Cancer Through Engineered Organoids.            	Engineered organoids by sequential introduction of key mutations could help modeling the dynamic cancer progression. However, it remains difficult to determine gene paths which were sufficient to capture cancer behaviors and to broadly explain cancer mechanisms. Here, as a case study of colorectal cancer (CRC), functional and dynamic characterizations of five types of engineered organoids with different mutation combinations of five driver genes (APC, SMAD4, KRAS, TP53, and PIK3CA) showed that sequential introductions of all five driver mutations could induce enhanced activation of more hallmark signatures, tending to cancer. Comparative analysis of engineered organoids and corresponding CRC tissues revealed sequential introduction of key mutations could continually shorten the biological distance from engineered organoids to CRC tissues. Nevertheless, there still existed substantial biological gaps between the engineered organoid even with five key mutations and CRC samples. Thus, we proposed an integrative strategy to prioritize gene cascading paths for shrinking biological gaps between engineered organoids and CRC tissues. Our results not only recapitulated the well-known adenoma-carcinoma sequence model (e.g., AKST-organoid with driver mutations in APC, KRAS, SMAD4, and TP53), but also provided potential paths for delineating alternative pathogenesis underlying CRC populations (e.g., A-organoid with APC mutation). Our strategy also can be applied to both organoids with more mutations and other cancers, which can improve and innovate mechanism across cancer patients for drug design and cancer therapy.

31978343        	Snake Venom Gland Organoids.            	Wnt dependency and Lgr5 expression define multiple mammalian epithelial stem cell types. Under defined growth factor conditions, such adult stem cells (ASCs) grow as 3D organoids that recapitulate essential features of the pertinent epithelium. Here, we establish long-term expanding venom gland organoids from several snake species. The newly assembled transcriptome of the Cape coral snake reveals that organoids express high levels of toxin transcripts. Single-cell RNA sequencing of both organoids and primary tissue identifies distinct venom-expressing cell types as well as proliferative cells expressing homologs of known mammalian stem cell markers. A hard-wired regional heterogeneity in the expression of individual venom components is maintained in organoid cultures. Harvested venom peptides reflect crude venom composition and display biological activity. This study extends organoid technology to reptilian tissues and describes an experimentally tractable model system representing the snake venom gland.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

30776676        	Permeability analyses and three dimensional imaging of interferon gamma-induced barrier disintegration in intestinal organoids.            	The aberrant regulation of the epithelial barrier integrity is involved in many diseases of the digestive tract, including inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer. Intestinal epithelial cell organoid cultures provide new perspectives for analyses of the intestinal barrier in vitro. However, established methods of barrier function analyses from two dimensional cultures have to be adjusted to the analysis of three dimensional organoid structures. Here we describe the methodology for analysis of epithelial barrier function and molecular regulation in intestinal organoids. Barrier responses to interferon-γ of intestinal organoids with and without epithelial cell-specific deletion of the interferon-γ-receptor 2 gene were used as a model system. The established method allowed monitoring of the kinetics of interferon-γ-induced permeability changes in living organoids. Proteolytic degradation and altered localization of the tight junction proteins claudin-2, -7, and - 15 was detected using confocal spinning disc microscopy with 3D reconstruction. Hessian analysis was used for quantification of re-localization of claudins.

31789399        	Annexin A10 is involved in the induction of pancreatic duodenal homeobox‑1 in gastric cancer tissue, cells and organoids.            	Gastric cancer (GC) is the third most common cause of cancer‑related death in the world. Annexin A10 (ANXA10), a member of the Annexin family, is a calcium‑/phospholipid‑binding protein; however, little is known concerning its functions. It is still unclear what molecule is involved in the induction of ANXA10. In the present study, we performed immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of ANXA10, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox‑1 (PDX1) and mucin phenotype markers in 130 GC samples. ANXA10 was detected in 63 (48%) of the 130 GC cases and loss of ANXA10 was significantly correlated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes in GC. PDX1 was significantly correlated with ANXA10 in GC cases and cell lines. Although PDX1 was not significantly correlated with the GC cases with any of the mucin phenotypes, ANXA10 was preferentially detected in the GC cases with the gastric mucin phenotype. As a further investigation, we generated organoids derived from human GC and identified the duplication of the mucin phenotypes of GC by immunohistochemistry. The repression effect on cell growth that was observed in the ANXA10‑knockdown cell lines was also clearly observed in the human gastric organoids. We demonstrated that the expression of ANXA10 was correlated with the gastric mucin phenotype and ANXA10 was involved in the induction of PDX1 expression in GC. We also provided evidence that GC organoids represent a powerful tool for scrutinizing the biology of GC, especially with regard to the mucin phenotype.	
25100563        	Quantitative optical imaging of primary tumor organoid metabolism predicts drug response in breast cancer.            	There is a need for technologies to predict the efficacy of cancer treatment in individual patients. Here, we show that optical metabolic imaging of organoids derived from primary tumors can predict the therapeutic response of xenografts and measure antitumor drug responses in human tumor-derived organoids. Optical metabolic imaging quantifies the fluorescence intensity and lifetime of NADH and FAD, coenzymes of metabolism. As early as 24 hours after treatment with clinically relevant anticancer drugs, the optical metabolic imaging index of responsive organoids decreased (P < 0.001) and was further reduced when effective therapies were combined (P < 5 × 10(-6)), with no change in drug-resistant organoids. Drug response in xenograft-derived organoids was validated with tumor growth measurements in vivo and staining for proliferation and apoptosis. Heterogeneous cellular responses to drug treatment were also resolved in organoids. Optical metabolic imaging shows potential as a high-throughput screen to test the efficacy of a panel of drugs to select optimal drug combinations.

31827102        	Extracellular matrix hydrogel derived from decellularized tissues enables endodermal organoid culture.            	Organoids have extensive therapeutic potential and are increasingly opening up new avenues within regenerative medicine. However, their clinical application is greatly limited by the lack of effective GMP-compliant systems for organoid expansion in culture. Here, we envisage that the use of extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels derived from decellularized tissues (DT) can provide an environment capable of directing cell growth. These gels possess the biochemical signature of tissue-specific ECM and have the potential for clinical translation. Gels from decellularized porcine small intestine (SI) mucosa/submucosa enable formation and growth of endoderm-derived human organoids, such as gastric, hepatic, pancreatic, and SI. ECM gels can be used as a tool for direct human organoid derivation, for cell growth with a stable transcriptomic signature, and for in vivo organoid delivery. The development of these ECM-derived hydrogels opens up the potential for human organoids to be used clinically.	
31449916        	Characterization of in vitro Mrp2 transporter model based on intestinal organoids.            	Multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2) is an important efflux transporter involved in clinical drug disposition and drug-drug interactions. The study of MRP2-mediated drug transport has become an integral part of drug discovery and development. In particular, screening of specific MRP2 inhibitors will help overcome the multidrug resistance in cancer. In this report, a new method for rapid and sensitive detection of Mrp2 function was established via using mouse small intestinal organoids. Firstly, small intestinal crypts isolated from mouse intestine were induced by Noggin, R-spondin1 and EGF to develop three-dimensional (3D) organoids. Secondly, the 3D organoids were characterized by the physical and physiological structure of Mrp2-mediated drug transport. Finally, Mrp2 fluorescent substrate 5(6)-carboxyl- 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein (CDF) and its inhibitor MK-571 and probenecid were used to demonstrate Mrp2-mediated CDF transport in 3D organoids. The results showed that the small intestinal organoids have a physiological structure for Mrp2-mediated compound transport. Moreover, MK-571 and probenecid, inhibitors of MRP2, significantly decreased the accumulation of CDF in 3D organoids. In summary, a novel intestinal organoid model has been successfully established for the rapid and effective study of Mrp2-mediated drug transport.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

31444473        	Three-dimensional modeling of human neurodegeneration: brain organoids coming of age.            	The prevalence of dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases is rapidly increasing in aging nations. These relentless and progressive diseases remain largely without disease-modifying treatments despite decades of research and investments. It is becoming clear that traditional two-dimensional culture and animal model systems, while providing valuable insights on the major pathophysiological pathways associated with these diseases, have not translated well to patients' bedside. Fortunately, the advent of induced-pluripotent stem cells and three-dimensional cell culture now provide tools that are revolutionizing the study of human diseases by permitting analysis of patient-derived human tissue with non-invasive procedures. Specifically, brain organoids, self-organizing neural structures that can mimic human fetal brain development, have now been harnessed to develop alternative models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, and Frontotemporal dementia by recapitulating important neuropathological hallmarks found in these disorders. Despite these early breakthroughs, several limitations need to be vetted in brain organoid models in order to more faithfully match human tissue qualities, including relative tissue immaturity, lack of vascularization and incomplete cellular diversity found in this culture system. Here, we review current brain organoid protocols, the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, and early studies with brain organoid neurodegeneration models. We then discuss the multiple engineering and conceptual challenges surrounding their use and provide possible solutions and exciting avenues to be pursued. Altogether, we believe that brain organoids models, improved with classical and emerging molecular and analytic tools, have the potential to unravel the opaque pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration and devise novel treatments for an array of neurodegenerative disorders.	
33142750        	Patient-Derived Papillary Thyroid Cancer Organoids for Radioactive Iodine Refractory Screening.            	Patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer, especially papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), are treated with surgical resection of the thyroid gland. This is followed by post-operative radioactive iodine (I131), resulting in total thyroid ablation. Unfortunately, about 15-33% of PTC patients are unable to take up I131, limiting further treatment options. The aim of our study was to develop a cancer organoid model with the potential for pre-treatment diagnosis of these I131-resistant patients. PTC tissue from thirteen patients was used to establish a long-term organoid model. These organoids showed a self-renewal potential for at least five passages, suggesting the presence of cancer stem cells. We demonstrated that thyroid specific markers, a PTC marker, and transporters/receptors necessary for iodine uptake and thyroid hormone production were expressed on a gene and protein level. Additionally, we cultured organoids from I131-resistant PTC material from three patients. When comparing PTC organoids to radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory disease (RAIRD) organoids, a substantial discordance on both a protein and gene expression level was observed, indicating a treatment prediction potential. We showed that patient-derived PTC organoids recapitulate PTC tissue and a RAIRD phenotype. Patient-specific PTC organoids may enable the early identification of I131-resistant patients, in order to reduce RAI overtreatment and its many side effects for thyroid cancer patients.	
29587663        	Development of primary human pancreatic cancer organoids, matched stromal and immune cells and 3D tumor microenvironment models.            	Patient-derived tumor models are the new standard for pre-clinical drug testing and biomarker discovery. However, the emerging technology of primary pancreatic cancer organoids has not yet been broadly implemented in research, and complex organotypic models using organoids in co-culture with stromal and immune cellular components of the tumor have yet to be established. In this study, our objective was to develop and characterize pancreatic cancer organoids and multi-cell type organotypic co-culture models to demonstrate their applicability to the study of pancreatic cancer.                We employed organoid culture methods and flow cytometric, cytologic, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical methods to develop and characterize patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids and multi-cell type organotypic co-culture models of the tumor microenvironment.                We describe the culture and characterization of human pancreatic cancer organoids from resection, ascites and rapid autopsy sources and the derivation of adherent tumor cell monocultures and tumor-associated fibroblasts from these sources. Primary human organoids displayed tumor-like cellular morphology, tissue architecture and polarity in contrast to cell line spheroids, which formed homogenous, non-lumen forming spheres. Importantly, we demonstrate the construction of complex organotypic models of tumor, stromal and immune components of the tumor microenvironment. Activation of myofibroblast-like cancer associated fibroblasts and tumor-dependent lymphocyte infiltration were observed in these models.                These studies provide the first report of novel and disease-relevant 3D in-vitro models representing pancreatic tumor, stromal and immune components using primary organoid co-cultures representative of the tumor-microenvironment. These models promise to facilitate the study of tumor-stroma and tumor-immune interaction and may be valuable for the assessment of immunotherapeutics such as checkpoint inhibitors in the context of T-cell infiltration.	
32724113        	Patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids capture the genomic profiles of primary tumours applicable for drug sensitivity and resistance testing.            	The use of primary patient-derived organoids for drug sensitivity and resistance testing could play an important role in precision cancer medicine. We developed expandable ovarian cancer organoids in < 3 weeks; these organoids captured the characteristics of histological cancer subtypes and replicated the mutational landscape of the primary tumours. Seven pairs of organoids (3 high-grade serous, 1 clear cell, 3 endometrioid) and original tumours shared 59.5% (36.1-73.1%) of the variants identified. Copy number variations were also similar among organoids and primary tumours. The organoid that harboured the BRCA1 pathogenic variant (p.L63*) showed a higher sensitivity to PARP inhibitor, olaparib, as well as to platinum drugs compared to the other organoids, whereas an organoid derived from clear cell ovarian cancer was resistant to conventional drugs for ovarian cancer, namely platinum drugs, paclitaxel, and olaparib. The overall success rate of primary organoid culture, including those of various histological subtypes, was 80% (28/35). Our data show that patient-derived organoids are suitable physiological ex vivo cancer models that can be used to screen effective personalised ovarian cancer drugs.	
33318192        	Human embryonic stem cell-derived organoid retinoblastoma reveals a cancerous origin.            	Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most prevalent intraocular malignancy in children, with a worldwide survival rate <30%. We have developed a cancerous model of Rb in retinal organoids derived from genetically engineered human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with a biallelic mutagenesis of the RB1 gene. These organoid Rbs exhibit properties highly consistent with Rb tumorigenesis, transcriptome, and genome-wide methylation. Single-cell sequencing analysis suggests that Rb originated from ARR3-positive maturing cone precursors during development, which was further validated by immunostaining. Notably, we found that the PI3K-Akt pathway was aberrantly deregulated and its activator spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) was significantly up-regulated. In addition, SYK inhibitors led to remarkable cell apoptosis in cancerous organoids. In conclusion, we have established an organoid Rb model derived from genetically engineered hESCs in a dish that has enabled us to trace the cell of origin and to test novel candidate therapeutic agents for human Rb, shedding light on the development and therapeutics of other malignancies.

32568249        	Single-Cell Resolution Three-Dimensional Imaging of Intact Organoids.            	Organoid technology, in vitro 3D culturing of miniature tissue, has opened a new experimental window for cellular processes that govern organ development and function as well as disease. Fluorescence microscopy has played a major role in characterizing their cellular composition in detail and demonstrating their similarity to the tissue they originate from. In this article, we present a comprehensive protocol for high-resolution 3D imaging of whole organoids upon immunofluorescent labeling. This method is widely applicable for imaging of organoids differing in origin, size and shape. Thus far we have applied the method to airway, colon, kidney, and liver organoids derived from healthy human tissue, as well as human breast tumor organoids and mouse mammary gland organoids. We use an optical clearing agent, FUnGI, which enables the acquisition of whole 3D organoids with the opportunity for single-cell quantification of markers. This three-day protocol from organoid harvesting to image analysis is optimized for 3D imaging using confocal microscopy.	
31910904        	Applications of patient-derived tumor xenograft models and tumor organoids.            	Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs), in which tumor fragments surgically dissected from cancer patients are directly transplanted into immunodeficient mice, have emerged as a useful model for translational research aimed at facilitating precision medicine. PDX susceptibility to anti-cancer drugs is closely correlated with clinical data in patients, from whom PDX models have been derived. Accumulating evidence suggests that PDX models are highly effective in predicting the efficacy of both conventional and novel anti-cancer therapeutics. This also allows "co-clinical trials," in which pre-clinical investigations in vivo and clinical trials could be performed in parallel or sequentially to assess drug efficacy in patients and PDXs. However, tumor heterogeneity present in PDX models and in the original tumor samples constitutes an obstacle for application of PDX models. Moreover, human stromal cells originally present in tumors dissected from patients are gradually replaced by host stromal cells as the xenograft grows. This replacement by murine stroma could preclude analysis of human tumor-stroma interactions, as some mouse stromal cytokines might not affect human carcinoma cells in PDX models. The present review highlights the biological and clinical significance of PDX models and three-dimensional patient-derived tumor organoid cultures of several kinds of solid tumors, such as those of the colon, pancreas, brain, breast, lung, skin, and ovary.	
28442534        	Oncogenic β-catenin and PIK3CA instruct network states and cancer phenotypes in intestinal organoids.            	Colorectal cancer is driven by cooperating oncogenic mutations. In this study, we use organotypic cultures derived from transgenic mice inducibly expressing oncogenic β-catenin and/or PIK3CAH1047R to follow sequential changes in cancer-related signaling networks, intestinal cell metabolism, and physiology in a three-dimensional environment mimicking tissue architecture. Activation of β-catenin alone results in the formation of highly clonogenic cells that are nonmotile and prone to undergo apoptosis. In contrast, coexpression of stabilized β-catenin and PIK3CAH1047R gives rise to intestinal cells that are apoptosis-resistant, proliferative, stem cell-like, and motile. Systematic inhibitor treatments of organoids followed by quantitative phenotyping and phosphoprotein analyses uncover key changes in the signaling network topology of intestinal cells after induction of stabilized β-catenin and PIK3CAH1047R We find that survival and motility of organoid cells are associated with 4EBP1 and AKT phosphorylation, respectively. Our work defines phenotypes, signaling network states, and vulnerabilities of transgenic intestinal organoids as a novel approach to understanding oncogene activities and guiding the development of targeted therapies.                © 2017 Riemer et al.	
32845994        	Human Forebrain Organoids from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells: A Novel Approach to Model Repair of Ionizing Radiation-Induced DNA Damage in Human Neurons.            	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can generate virtually any cell type and therefore are applied to studies of organ development, disease modeling, drug screening and cell replacement therapy. Under proper culture conditions in vitro induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be differentiated to form organ-like tissues, also known as "organoids", which resemble organs more closely than cells, in vivo. We hypothesized that human brain organoids can be used as an experimental model to study mechanisms underlying DNA repair in human neurons and their progenitors after radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the most severe form of DNA damage. To this end, we customized a protocol for brain organoid generation that is time efficient. These organoids recapitulate key features of human cortical neuron development, including a subventricular zone containing neural progenitors that mature to postmitotic cortical neurons. Using immunofluorescence to measure DNA DSB markers, such as γ-H2AX and 53BP1, we quantified the kinetics of DSB repair in neural progenitors within the subventricular zone for up to 24 h after a single 2 Gy dose of ionizing radiation. Our data on DNA repair in progenitor versus mature neurons indicate a similar timeline: both repair DNA DSBs which is mostly resolved by 18 h postirradiation. However, repair kinetics are more acute in progenitors than mature neurons in the mature organoid. Overall, this study supports the use of 3D organoid culture technology as a novel platform to study DNA damage responses in developing or mature neurons, which has been previously difficult to study.                ©2020 by Radiation Research Society.

25777294        	Liver-Tumor Hybrid Organoids for Modeling Tumor Growth and Drug Response In Vitro.            	Current in vitro models for tumor growth and metastasis are poor facsimiles of in vivo cancer physiology and thus, are not optimal for anti-cancer drug development. Three dimensional (3D) tissue organoid systems, which utilize human cells in a tailored microenvironment, have the potential to recapitulate in vivo conditions and address the drawbacks of current tissue culture dish 2D models. In this study, we created liver-based cell organoids in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor. The organoids were further inoculated with colon carcinoma cells in order to create liver-tumor organoids for in vitro modeling of liver metastasis. Immunofluorescent staining revealed notable phenotypic differences between tumor cells in 2D and inside the organoids. In 2D they displayed an epithelial phenotype, and only after transition to the organoids did the cells present with a mesenchymal phenotype. The cell surface marker expression results suggested that WNT pathway might be involved in the phenotypic changes observed between cells in 2D and organoid conditions, and may lead to changes in cell proliferation. Manipulating the WNT pathway with an agonist and antagonist showed significant changes in sensitivity to the anti-proliferative drug 5-fluoruracil. Collectively, the results show the potential of in vitro 3D liver-tumor organoids to serve as a model for metastasis growth and for testing the response of tumor cells to current and newly discovered drugs.	
32035490        	Human fallopian tube epithelial cells exhibit stemness features, self-renewal capacity, and Wnt-related organoid formation.            	Fallopian tube epithelial cells (FTEC) were thought to be the origin of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Knowledge of the stemness or initiating characteristics of FTEC is insufficient. Previously, we have characterized the stemness cell marker of FTEC, this study aims to further characterize the clonogenicity and spheroid features of FTEC.                We successfully derived FTECs from the epithelial layer of the human fallopian tubes. We examined the morphology, proliferation rate, doubling time, and clonal growth of them. At passage 3, the sphere formations on gelatin-coated culture, suspension culture, and matrigel culture were observed, and the expression of LGR5, SSEA3, SSEA4, and other stemness markers was examined. Furthermore, tissue-reconstituted organoids from coculture of FTEC, fallopian stromal cells (FTMSC) and endothelial cells (HUVEC) were examined.                FTEC exhibited cuboidal cell morphology and maintained at a constant proliferation rate for up to nine passages (P9). FTEC could proliferate from a single cell with a clonogenic efficiency of 4%. Flow cytometry revealed expressions of normal stem cell markers (SSEA3, SSEA4, and LGR5) and cancer stem cell markers (CD24, CD44, CD117, ROR1, and CD133). FTEC formed spheres and colonies when cultured on low attach dish. In the presence of Matrigel, the stemness and colony formation activity were much enhanced. In co-culturing with FTMSC and HUVEC, FTEC could form organoids that could be blocked by Wnt inhibitor DKK1. Expressions of LGR5 and FOXJ1 expression were also decreased by adding DKK1.                We demonstrated abundantly presence of stem cells in human FTECs which are efficient in forming colonies, spheres and organoids, relying on Wnt signaling. We also reported for the first time the generation of organoid from reconstitutied cell lineages in the tissue. This may provide a new model for studying the regneration and malignant transformation of the tubal epithelium.	
31233891        	3D bioprinted mammary organoids and tumoroids in human mammary derived ECM hydrogels.            	The extracellular matrix (ECM) of tissues is an important mediator of cell function. Moreover, understanding cellular dynamics within their specific tissue context is also important for developmental biology, cancer research, and regenerative medicine. However, robust in vitro models that incorporate tissue-specific microenvironments are lacking. Here we describe a novel mammary-specific culture protocol that combines a self-gelling hydrogel comprised solely of ECM from decellularized rat or human breast tissue with the use of our previously described 3D bioprinting platform. We initially demonstrate that undigested and decellularized mammary tissue can support mammary epithelial and tumor cell growth. We then describe a methodology for generating mammary ECM extracts that can spontaneously gel to form hydrogels. These ECM hydrogels retain unique structural and signaling profiles that elicit differential responses when normal mammary and breast cancer cells are cultured within them. Using our bioprinter, we establish that we can generate large organoids/tumoroids in the all mammary-derived hydrogel. These findings demonstrate that our system allows for growth of organoids/tumoroids in a tissue-specific matrix with unique properties, thus providing a suitable platform for ECM and epithelial/cancer cell studies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Factors within extracellular matrices (ECMs) are specific to their tissue of origin. It has been shown that tissue specific factors within the mammary gland's ECM have pronounced effects on cellular differentiation and cancer behavior. Understanding the role of the ECM in controlling cell fate has major implications for developmental biology, tissue engineering, and cancer therapy. However, in vitro models to study cellular interactions with tissue specific ECM are lacking. Here we describe the generation of 3D hydrogels consisting solely of human or mouse mammary ECM. We demonstrate that these novel 3D culture substrates can sustain large 3D bioprinted organoid and tumoroid formation. This is the first demonstration of an all mammary ECM culture system capable of sustaining large structural growths.                Copyright © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

30581078        	Constructing and Deconstructing Cancers using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells and Organoids.            	Cell lines and animal models have provided the foundation of cancer research for many years. However, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and organoids are increasingly enabling insights into tumor development, progression, and treatment. Here, we review recent studies using hPSCs to elucidate the reciprocal roles played by genetic alterations and cell identity in cancer formation. We also review studies using human organoids as models that recapitulate both intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity to gain new insights into tumorigenesis and treatment responses. Finally, we highlight potential opportunities for cancer research using hPSC-derived organoids and genome editing in the future.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
25796043        	Organoid development in cancer genome discovery.            	The tumor response to most therapeutic agents in cancer is highly unpredictable. Cancer models which can adequately represent tumor heterogeneity and predict in vivo drug sensitivity are intense areas of investigation. Cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models are the most frequently used models in cancer research and anticancer drug screening. Recently, cancer 'organoid' culture conditions have been developed to establish in vitro growth of patient-derived samples at higher efficiency and they are very promising for large scale drug screening and fundamental cancer biology research. Here, we leverage our experience in prostate cancer to discuss the advantages and limitations of these cancer models and summarize the development of cancer organoid culture--a development which may provide a new path towards personalized medicine in the future.

30886143        	Chronic Chlamydia infection in human organoids increases stemness and promotes age-dependent CpG methylation.            	Chronic infections of the fallopian tubes with Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) cause scarring and can lead to infertility. Here we use human fallopian tube organoids and genital Ctr serovars D, K and E for long-term in vitro analysis. The epithelial monolayer responds with active expulsion of the bacteria into the lumen and with compensatory cellular proliferation-demonstrating a role of epithelial homeostasis in the defense against this pathogen. In addition, Ctr infection activates LIF signaling, which we find to be an essential regulator of stemness in the organoids. Infected organoids exhibit a less differentiated phenotype with higher stemness potential, as confirmed by increased organoid forming efficiency. Moreover, Ctr increases hypermethylation of DNA, which is an indicator of accelerated molecular aging. Thus, the chronic organoid infection model suggests that Ctr has a long-term impact on the epithelium. These heritable changes might be a contributing factor in the development of tubal pathologies, including the initiation of high grade serous ovarian cancer.	
32944935        	Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors in human organoids.            	Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. Reports denote SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as its primary entry point into the host cell. However, understanding the biology behind this viral replication, disease mechanism and drug discovery efforts are limited due to the lack of a suitable experimental model. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing data of human organoids to analyze expressions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in addition to an array of RNA receptors to examine their role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. ACE2 is abundant in all organoids, except the prostate and brain, and TMPRSS2 is omnipresent. Innate immune pathways are upregulated in ACE2(+) cells of all organoids, except the lungs. Besides this, the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor is highly enriched in ACE2(+) cells in intestinal, lung, and retinal organoids, with the highest expression in lung organoids. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the organoids can be used as an experimental platform to explore this novel virus disease mechanism and for drug development.                © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

27634879        	Large variety in a panel of human colon cancer organoids in response to EZH2 inhibition.            	EZH2 inhibitors have gained great interest for their use as anti-cancer therapeutics. However, most research has focused on EZH2 mutant cancers and recently adverse effects of EZH2 inactivation have come to light. To determine whether colorectal cancer cells respond to EZH2 inhibition and to explore which factors influence the degree of response, we treated a panel of 20 organoid lines derived from human colon tumors with different concentrations of the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126. The resulting responses were associated with mutation status, gene expression and responses to other drugs. We found that the response to GSK126 treatment greatly varied between organoid lines. Response associated with the mutation status of ATRX and PAX2, and correlated with BIK expression. It also correlated well with response to Nutlin-3a which inhibits MDM2-p53 interaction thereby activating p53 signaling. Sensitivity to EZH2 ablation depended on the presence of wild type p53, as tumor organoids became resistant when p53 was mutated or knocked down. Our exploratory study provides insight into which genetic factors predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. In addition, we show that the response to EZH2 inhibition requires wild type p53. We conclude that a subset of colorectal cancer patients may benefit from EZH2-targeting therapies.	
29561796        	Disease Modeling Using 3D Organoids Derived from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.            	The rising interest in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoid culture has stemmed from the manipulation of various combinations of directed multi-lineage differentiation and morphogenetic processes that mimic organogenesis. Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) structures that are comprised of multiple cell types, self-organized to recapitulate embryonic and tissue development in vitro. This model has been shown to be superior to conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture methods in mirroring functionality, architecture, and geometric features of tissues seen in vivo. This review serves to highlight recent advances in the 3D organoid technology for use in modeling complex hereditary diseases, cancer, host-microbe interactions, and possible use in translational and personalized medicine where organoid cultures were used to uncover diagnostic biomarkers for early disease detection via high throughput pharmaceutical screening. In addition, this review also aims to discuss the advantages and shortcomings of utilizing organoids in disease modeling. In summary, studying human diseases using hiPSC-derived organoids may better illustrate the processes involved due to similarities in the architecture and microenvironment present in an organoid, which also allows drug responses to be properly recapitulated in vitro.	
30820473        	A simple high-throughput approach identifies actionable drug sensitivities in patient-derived tumor organoids.            	Tumor organoids maintain cell-cell interactions, heterogeneity, microenvironment, and drug response of the sample they originate from. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing tumor organoid models for drug development and personalized medicine applications. Although organoids are in principle amenable to high-throughput screenings, progress has been hampered by technical constraints and extensive manipulations required by current methods. Here we introduce a miniaturized method that uses a simplified geometry by seeding cells around the rim of the wells (mini-rings). This allows high-throughput screenings in a format compatible with automation as shown using four patient-derived tumor organoids established from two ovarian and one peritoneal high-grade serous carcinomas and one carcinosarcoma of the ovary. Using our automated screening platform, we identified personalized responses by measuring viability, number, and size of organoids after exposure to 240 kinase inhibitors. Results are available within a week from surgery, a timeline compatible with therapeutic decision-making.	
32743583        	Progenitor identification and SARS-CoV-2 infection in long-term human distal lung organoid cultures.            	The distal lung contains terminal bronchioles and alveoli that facilitate gas exchange and is affected by disorders including interstitial lung disease, cancer, and SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 pneumonia. Investigations of these localized pathologies have been hindered by a lack of 3D in vitro human distal lung culture systems. Further, human distal lung stem cell identification has been impaired by quiescence, anatomic divergence from mouse and lack of lineage tracing and clonogenic culture. Here, we developed robust feeder-free, chemically-defined culture of distal human lung progenitors as organoids derived clonally from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential, while basal cell organoids progressively developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Organoids consisting solely of club cells were not observed. Upon single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), alveolar organoids were composed of proliferative AT2 cells; however, basal organoid KRT5+ cells contained a distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction. Clonogenic organoid growth was markedly enriched within the TNFRSF12A hi subset of FACS-purified ITGA6 + ITGB4 + basal cells from human lung or derivative organoids. In vivo, TNFRSF12A + cells comprised ~10% of KRT5 + basal cells and resided in clusters within terminal bronchioles. To model COVID-19 distal lung disease, we everted the polarity of basal and alveolar organoids to rapidly relocate differentiated club and ciliated cells from the organoid lumen to the exterior surface, thus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on the outwardly-facing apical aspect. Accordingly, basal and AT2 apical-out organoids were infected by SARS-CoV-2, identifying club cells as a novel target population. This long-term, feeder-free organoid culture of human distal lung alveolar and basal stem cells, coupled with single cell analysis, identifies unsuspected basal cell functional heterogeneity and exemplifies progenitor identification within a slowly proliferating human tissue. Further, our studies establish a facile in vitro organoid model for human distal lung infectious diseases including COVID-19-associated pneumonia.	
26797458        	Organoid culture systems for prostate epithelial and cancer tissue.            	This protocol describes a strategy for the generation of 3D prostate organoid cultures from healthy mouse and human prostate cells (either bulk or FACS-sorted single luminal and basal cells), metastatic prostate cancer lesions and circulating tumor cells. Organoids derived from healthy material contain the differentiated luminal and basal cell types, whereas organoids derived from prostate cancer tissue mimic the histology of the tumor. We explain how to establish these cultures in the fully defined serum-free conditioned medium that is required to sustain organoid growth. Starting with the plating of digested tissue material, full-grown organoids can usually be obtained in ∼2 weeks. The culture protocol we describe here is currently the only one that allows the growth of both the luminal and basal prostatic epithelial lineages, as well as the growth of advanced prostate cancers. Organoids established using this protocol can be used to study many different aspects of prostate biology, including homeostasis, tumorigenesis and drug discovery.	
32512510        	Organoid modelling identifies that DACH1 functions as a tumour promoter in colorectal cancer by modulating BMP signalling.            	Dachshund homologue 1 (DACH1) is highly expressed in LGR5+ intestinal stem cells and colorectal tumours. However, the roles of DACH1 in intestinal cell stemness and colorectal tumorigenesis remain largely undefined.                We used immunohistochemistry, western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR to analyse DACH1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression and shRNA-mediated knockdown of DACH1 were utilized to modulate DACH1 expression in cell lines and organoids. An intestinal organoid-based functional model was analysed, and cancer cell colony formation, sphere formation assays and murine xenotransplants were performed to reveal the role of DACH1 in CRC cell proliferation, stemness and tumorigenesis. Immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, RNA interference and microarray data analyses were conducted to demonstrate the association between DACH1 and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathway.                DACH1 is specifically expressed in discrete crypt base cells, and increased DACH1 expression was found in all stages of CRC. Moreover, the high expression of DACH1 independently predicted poor prognosis. In colon cancer cells, shRNA-mediated suppression of DACH1 inhibited cell growth in vitro and in vivo. By studying the intestinal organoid-based functional model, we found that depletion of DACH1 reduced the organoid formation efficiency and tumour organoid size. DACH1 overexpression stimulated both colonsphere formation and tumour organoid formation in the context of dysregulated BMP signalling. Mechanistic characterizations indicated that overexpression of DACH1 affects a subset of stem cell signature genes implicated in stem cell proliferation and maintenance through the suppression of BMP signalling via SMAD4.                Together, our study highlights DACH1 as an integral regulator of BMP signalling during intestinal tumorigenesis, and DACH1 could be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for colorectal cancer patients.

30418092        	Importance of organoids for personalized medicine.            	The establishment of organoid culture systems represents a milestone on the route toward successful personalized medicine. This mini review provides an update on the current status of organoid technology and summarizes their applications in personalized medicine. Organoids can be defined as 3D structures derived either from pluripotent or organ restricted stem cells harboring the ability to mimic in vivo architecture and multi lineage differentiation of terminally differentiated tissues. Due to their unique ability of virtually unlimited self-renewal, organoid cultures should be distinguished from previous 'sphere'-culture assays, for example, 'tumor spheres' that have already been described and applied over the last decades.	
33087703        	Single-cell derived tumor organoids display diversity in HLA class I peptide presentation.            	Tumor heterogeneity is a major cause of therapeutic resistance. Immunotherapy may exploit alternative vulnerabilities of drug-resistant cells, where tumor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptide ligands are promising leads to invoke targeted anti-tumor responses. Here, we investigate the variability in HLA class I peptide presentation between different clonal cells of the same colorectal cancer patient, using an organoid system. While clone-specific differences in HLA peptide presentation were observed, broad inter-clone variability was even more prevalent (15-25%). By coupling organoid proteomics and HLA peptide ligandomics, we also found that tumor-specific ligands from DNA damage control and tumor suppressor source proteins were prominently presented by tumor cells, coinciding likely with the silencing of such cytoprotective functions. Collectively, these data illustrate the heterogeneous HLA peptide presentation landscape even within one individual, and hint that a multi-peptide vaccination approach against highly conserved tumor suppressors may be a viable option in patients with low tumor-mutational burden.	
32657929        	Patient-derived Organoid Pharmacotyping is a Clinically Tractable Strategy for Precision Medicine in Pancreatic Cancer.            	PDAC patients who undergo surgical resection and receive effective chemotherapy have the best chance of long-term survival. Unfortunately, we lack predictive biomarkers to guide optimal systemic treatment. Ex-vivo generation of PDO for pharmacotyping may serve as predictive biomarkers in PDAC. The goal of the current study was to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of a PDO-guided precision medicine framework of care.                PDO cultures were established from surgical specimens and endoscopic biopsies, expanded in Matrigel, and used for high-throughput drug testing (pharmacotyping). Efficacy of standard-of-care chemotherapeutics was assessed by measuring cell viability after drug exposure.                A framework for rapid pharmacotyping of PDOs was established across a multi-institutional consortium of academic medical centers. Specimens obtained remotely and shipped to a central biorepository maintain viability and allowed generation of PDOs with 77% success. Early cultures maintain the clonal heterogeneity seen in PDAC with similar phenotypes (cystic-solid). Late cultures exhibit a dominant clone with a pharmacotyping profile similar to early passages. The biomass required for accurate pharmacotyping can be minimized by leveraging a high-throughput technology. Twenty-nine cultures were pharmacotyped to derive a population distribution of chemotherapeutic sensitivity at our center. Pharmacotyping rapidly-expanded PDOs was completed in a median of 48 (range 18-102) days.                Rapid development of PDOs from patients undergoing surgery for PDAC is eminently feasible within the perioperative recovery period, enabling the potential for pharmacotyping to guide postoperative adjuvant chemotherapeutic selection. Studies validating PDOs as a promising predictive biomarker are ongoing.                Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.	
33524147        	Organoid cultures derived from patients with papillary thyroid cancer.            	Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has been one of the most frequent endocrine malignancies around the world. Although most PTC patients have a favorable prognosis, a subgroup of patients die, especially when disease recurrence occurs. There is a pressing need for clinically relevant preclinical thyroid cancer models for personalized therapy due to the lack of in vitro models that faithfully represent the biology of the parental tumors.                To understand thyroid cancer and translate this knowledge to clinical applications, the patient-derived PTC organoids as a promising new preclinical model were established.                Surgically resected PTC primary tissues were dissociated and processed for organoid derivation. Tumor organoids were subsequently subjected to histological characterization, DNA-sequencing, drug screen, and cell proliferation assay, respectively.                We describe a three-dimensional culture system for the long-term expansion of patient-derived PTC organoid lines. Notably, PTC organoids preserve the histopathological profiles and genomic heterogeneity of the originating tumors. Drug sensitivity assays of PTC organoids demonstrate patient-specific drug responses, and large correlations with the respective mutational profiles. Estradiol was shown to promote cell proliferation of PTC organoids in the presence of estrogen receptor α (ERα), regardless of the expression of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER).                These data suggest that this newly developed PTC-derived organoids may be an excellent preclinical model for studying clinical response to anticancer drugs in a personalized way, as well as provide a potential strategy to develop the prevention and treatment options for thyroid cancer with ERα-specific antagonists.                © The Author(s) 2021.

31562298        	Urothelial organoids originating from Cd49fhigh mouse stem cells display Notch-dependent differentiation capacity.            	Understanding urothelial stem cell biology and differentiation has been limited by the lack of methods for their unlimited propagation. Here, we establish mouse urothelial organoids that can be maintained uninterruptedly for >1 year. Organoid growth is dependent on EGF and Wnt activators. High CD49f/ITGA6 expression features a subpopulation of organoid-forming cells expressing basal markers. Upon differentiation, multilayered organoids undergo reduced proliferation, decreased cell layer number, urothelial program activation, and acquisition of barrier function. Pharmacological modulation of PPARγ and EGFR promotes differentiation. RNA sequencing highlighted genesets enriched in proliferative organoids (i.e. ribosome) and transcriptional networks involved in differentiation, including expression of Wnt ligands and Notch components. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis of the organoids revealed five clusters with distinct gene expression profiles. Together, with the use of γ-secretase inhibitors and scRNA-Seq, confirms that Notch signaling is required for differentiation. Urothelial organoids provide a powerful tool to study cell regeneration and differentiation.	
33552510        	Patient-derived organoids of bladder cancer recapitulate antigen expression profiles and serve as a personal evaluation model for CAR-T cells in vitro.            	Recent advances in patient-derived cancer organoids have opened a new avenue for personalised medicine. We aimed to establish an in vitro technological platform to evaluate chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against bladder cancer.                Patient-derived bladder cancer organoids (BCOs) were derived using classic medium containing R-spondin 1 and noggin. The features of BCOs were characterised via H&E, whole-exome sequencing and immunofluorescence of specific markers. Surface antigen expression profiles of the recently identified CAR-recognisable targets were determined with a panel of antibodies via immunohistochemistry. A co-cultivation system consisting of BCOs and engineered T cells targeting a specific antigen was utilised to test its efficacy to model immunotherapy by cytotoxic assays and ELISA.                Bladder cancer organoid lines of basal and luminal subtypes were established. The histopathological morphology, genomic alteration, and specific marker expression profiles showed that the BCO lines retained the characteristics of the original tumors. Among all tested CAR-recognisable antigens in other solid tumors, MUC1 was simultaneously expressed in organoids and parental tumor tissues. Given the surface antigen profiles, second-generation CAR-T cells targeting MUC1 were prepared for modelling in vitro immunotherapy responses in BCOs. Specific immune cytotoxicity occurred only in the MUC1+ organoids but not in the MUC1- organoids or control CAR-T cells.                Patient-derived BCOs recapitulate the heterogeneity and key features of parental cancer tissues, and these BCOs could be useful for preclinical testing of CAR-T cells in vitro.                © 2021 The Authors.

30363662        	A Bioinformatic Profile of Gene Expression of Colorectal Carcinoma Derived Organoids.            	Colorectal carcinoma is one of the common cancers in human. It has been intensely debated whether the in vitro cancer cell lines are closely enough for recapitulating the original tumor in understanding the molecular characteristic of CRC. Organoid as a new in vitro 3D culture system has sprang out in CRC study for the capability in reviving the original tissue. The aim of this study is to profile the gene expression of CRC organoid. The gene expression GSE64392 was from GEO database contained 20-patients-derived 37 organoid samples, including 22 colorectal tumor organoid samples and 15 paired healthy samples. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were applied for classifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Protein interaction among DEGs was analyzed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) and Cytoscape software. In total, 853 gene sequences were identified. GO analysis revealed that DEGs were extensively involved in various biological process (BP), like proliferation, cell cycle, and biosynthesis. KEEG pathway analysis showed that WNT, MAPK, TGF-β, SHH, ECM-receptor interaction, and FGF pathways were altered. DEGs which were identified with protein interactions were major response for extracellular matrix organization and the GPCR pathway. In conclusion, our study profiled the DEGs in CRC organoids and promotes our understanding of the CRC organoids as a new model for colorectal cancer research.	
30674533        	Metastatic Tumor-in-a-Dish, a Novel Multicellular Organoid to Study Lung Colonization and Predict Therapeutic Response.            	Metastasis is a major cause of cancer-related deaths. A dearth of preclinical models that recapitulate the metastatic microenvironment has impeded the development of therapeutic agents that are effective against metastatic disease. Because the majority of solid tumors metastasize to the lung, we developed a multicellular lung organoid that mimics the lung microenvironment with air sac-like structures and production of lung surfactant protein. We used these cultures, called primitive lung-in-a-dish (PLiD), to recreate metastatic disease using primary and established cancer cells. The metastatic tumor-in-a-dish (mTiD) cultures resemble the architecture of metastatic tumors in the lung, including angiogenesis. Pretreating PLiD with tumor exosomes enhanced cancer cell colonization. We next tested the response of primary and established cancer cells to current chemotherapeutic agents and an anti-VEGF antibody in mTiD against cancer cells in two-dimensional (2D) or 3D cultures. The response of primary patient-derived colon and ovarian tumor cells to therapy in mTiD cultures matched the response of the patient in the clinic, but not in 2D or single-cell-type 3D cultures. The sensitive mTiD cultures also produced significantly lower circulating markers for cancer similar to that seen in patients who responded to therapy. Thus, we have developed a novel method for lung colonization in vitro, a final stage in tumor metastasis. Moreover, the technique has significant utility in precision/personalized medicine, wherein this phenotypic screen can be coupled with current DNA pharmacogenetics to identify the ideal therapeutic agent, thereby increasing the probability of response to treatment while reducing unnecessary side effects.

29871632        	Harnessing single-cell genomics to improve the physiological fidelity of organoid-derived cell types.            	Single-cell genomic methods now provide unprecedented resolution for characterizing the component cell types and states of tissues such as the epithelial subsets of the gastrointestinal tract. Nevertheless, functional studies of these subsets at scale require faithful in vitro models of identified in vivo biology. While intestinal organoids have been invaluable in providing mechanistic insights in vitro, the extent to which organoid-derived cell types recapitulate their in vivo counterparts remains formally untested, with no systematic approach for improving model fidelity.                Here, we present a generally applicable framework that utilizes massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq to compare cell types and states found in vivo to those of in vitro models such as organoids. Furthermore, we leverage identified discrepancies to improve model fidelity. Using the Paneth cell (PC), which supports the stem cell niche and produces the largest diversity of antimicrobials in the small intestine, as an exemplar, we uncover fundamental gene expression differences in lineage-defining genes between in vivo PCs and those of the current in vitro organoid model. With this information, we nominate a molecular intervention to rationally improve the physiological fidelity of our in vitro PCs. We then perform transcriptomic, cytometric, morphologic and proteomic characterization, and demonstrate functional (antimicrobial activity, niche support) improvements in PC physiology.                Our systematic approach provides a simple workflow for identifying the limitations of in vitro models and enhancing their physiological fidelity. Using adult stem cell-derived PCs within intestinal organoids as a model system, we successfully benchmark organoid representation, relative to that in vivo, of a specialized cell type and use this comparison to generate a functionally improved in vitro PC population. We predict that the generation of rationally improved cellular models will facilitate mechanistic exploration of specific disease-associated genes in their respective cell types.	
26485224        	What role could organoids play in the personalization of cancer treatment?            	Cancer treatments are increasingly being targeted to specific patient populations based on the molecular and genetic features of their tumor, so called precision or personalized cancer medicine. Preclinical cancer models are essential tools for cancer research, but unfortunately our current models often fail to effectively represent patient tumors and can be poorly predictive of clinical responses. In this perspective, we discuss the use of new in vitro 3D cell models called 'organoids' as preclinical cancer models in the context of other commonly used models, namely cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. We consider the relative strengths and limitations of each model, and discuss how organoid culture models could facilitate the personalization of cancer medicine.	
32007597        	Application of organoids in translational research of human diseases with a particular focus on gastrointestinal cancers.            	Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers constitute the largest portion of all human cancers and represent a significant health burden on modern society. Conventional therapeutic approaches such as chemotherapy and surgical resections often fail due to poor treatment response or tumour relapse. Unfortunately, drug discovery for GI cancers has stalled as current cancer models fail to recapitulate critical features of the parent tumour, leading to poor translation from bench to bedside. Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) cell culturing techniques have driven the surge of interest in stem cell-derived organoid models, a promising platform with a plethora of potential applications due to its ability to retain crucial architectural, genomic and transcriptional properties of the native tissue. In this review article, we discuss current applications and advantages of organoid models in the translational research of GI cancers with a particular focus on primary liver cancer that currently lack effective curative treatments.

27511963        	Establishing estrogen-responsive mouse mammary organoids from single Lgr5+ cells.            	Recent evidence suggests that mammary cells expressing R-spondin receptor and Wnt pathway regulator Lgr5, regarded as a stem cell marker in multiple tissues, might represent mammary stem cells (MaSCs). Whether L gr5 marks a multipotent subpopulation of Lin-CD24low/medCD49fhigh MaSCs remains controversial. To some extent the differing results reflect different assays used to assess properties of stemness, including lineage tracing in vivo, mammosphere culture, and mammary fat pad transplantation assays. To address this issue directly, we isolated Lgr5+ cells from mammary glands of Lgr5-lacZ mice and established organoids based on principles adapted from studies of Wnt-driven Lgr5+ cell populations in other organs. Mammary organoids were grown from single Lgr5+ mammary cells in Matrigel, the substratum of choice for intestinal organoids, and in a growth factor cocktail containing EGF, Wnt3a and R-spondin, designed to optimally activate the endogenous Wnt signaling program of stem cells. Colonies derived from single Lgr5+ cells manifest at least four distinct cell populations: Lgr5+ and Lgr5- basal cells and c-Kit+ and c-Kit- luminal cells that spontaneously organize into a ductal structure with basal cells around the periphery and luminal cells lining an interior cavity, reminiscent of normal mammary duct structure. Lgr5+ cell-derived organoids were sustainable during prolonged passaging. In contrast, although Lgr5- cells expand into primary colonies, colony-forming efficiency immediately dissipated upon passaging. Furthermore, reproductive hormones induce epithelial cell proliferation resulting in marked increases in lumen diameter accompanied by squamous transdifferentiation. We propose this estrogen-responsive, self-organizing duct-like structure derived from single murine Lgr5+ mammary cells represents a "mini-breast" organoid.                Copyright Â© 2016.

29959891        	Thrombin modifies growth, proliferation and apoptosis of human colon organoids: a protease-activated receptor 1- and protease-activated receptor 4-dependent mechanism.            	Thrombin is massively released upon tissue damage associated with bleeding or chronic inflammation. The effects of this thrombin on tissue regrowth and repair has been scarcely addressed and only in cancer cell lines. Hence, the purpose of the present study was to determine thrombin's pharmacological effects on human intestinal epithelium growth, proliferation and apoptosis, using three-dimensional cultures of human colon organoids.                Crypts were isolated from human colonic resections and cultured for 6 days, forming human colon organoids. Cultured organoids were exposed to 10 and 50 mU·mL-1 of thrombin, in the presence or not of protease-activated receptor (PAR) antagonists. Organoid morphology, metabolism, proliferation and apoptosis were followed.                Thrombin favoured organoid maturation leading to a decreased number of immature cystic structures and a concomitant increased number of larger structures releasing cell debris and apoptotic cells. The size of budding structures, metabolic activity and proliferation were significantly reduced in organoid cultures exposed to thrombin, while apoptosis was dramatically increased. Both PAR1 and PAR4 antagonists inhibited apoptosis regardless of thrombin doses. Thrombin-induced inhibition of proliferation and metabolic activity were reversed by PAR4 antagonist for thrombin's lowest dose and by PAR1 antagonist for thrombin's highest dose.                Overall, our data suggest that the presence of thrombin in the vicinity of human colon epithelial cells favours their maturation at the expense of their regenerative capacities. Our data point to thrombin and its two receptors PAR1 and PAR4 as potential molecular targets for epithelial repair therapies.                © 2018 The Authors.

31053799        	High-resolution 3D imaging of fixed and cleared organoids.            	In vitro 3D organoid systems have revolutionized the modeling of organ development and diseases in a dish. Fluorescence microscopy has contributed to the characterization of the cellular composition of organoids and demonstrated organoids' phenotypic resemblance to their original tissues. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for performing high-resolution 3D imaging of entire organoids harboring fluorescence reporters and upon immunolabeling. This method is applicable to a wide range of organoids of differing origins and of various sizes and shapes. We have successfully used it on human airway, colon, kidney, liver and breast tumor organoids, as well as on mouse mammary gland organoids. It includes a simple clearing method utilizing a homemade fructose-glycerol clearing agent that captures 3D organoids in full and enables marker quantification on a cell-by-cell basis. Sample preparation has been optimized for 3D imaging by confocal, super-resolution confocal, multiphoton and light-sheet microscopy. From organoid harvest to image analysis, the protocol takes 3 d.	
32235647        	Cholangiocarcinoma Disease Modelling Through Patients Derived Organoids.            	Cancer organoids are 3D phenotypic cultures that can be established from resected or biopsy tumour samples and can be grown as mini tumours in the dish. Flourishing evidence supports the feasibility of patient derived organoids (PDO) from a number of solid tumours. Evidence for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) PDO is still sparse but growing. CCA PDO lines have been established from resected early stage disease, advanced cancers and highly chemorefractory tumours. Cancer PDO was shown to recapitulate the 3D morphology, genomic landscape and transcriptomic profile of the source counterpart. They proved to be a valued model for drug discovery and sensitivity testing, and they showed to mimic the drug response observed in vivo in the patients. However, PDO lack representation of the intratumour heterogeneity and the tumour-stroma interaction. The efficiency rate of CCA PDO within the three different subtypes, intrahepatic, perihilar and distal, is still to be explored. In this manuscript we will review evidence for CCA PDO highlighting advantages and limitations of this novel disease model.	
29673279        	Advanced Development of Primary Pancreatic Organoid Tumor Models for High-Throughput Phenotypic Drug Screening.            	Traditional high-throughput drug screening in oncology routinely relies on two-dimensional (2D) cell models, which inadequately recapitulate the physiologic context of cancer. Three-dimensional (3D) cell models are thought to better mimic the complexity of in vivo tumors. Numerous methods to culture 3D organoids have been described, but most are nonhomogeneous and expensive, and hence impractical for high-throughput screening (HTS) purposes. Here we describe an HTS-compatible method that enables the consistent production of organoids in standard flat-bottom 384- and 1536-well plates by combining the use of a cell-repellent surface with a bioprinting technology incorporating magnetic force. We validated this homogeneous process by evaluating the effects of well-characterized anticancer agents against four patient-derived pancreatic cancer KRAS mutant-associated primary cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts. This technology was tested for its compatibility with HTS automation by completing a cytotoxicity pilot screen of ~3300 approved drugs. To highlight the benefits of the 3D format, we performed this pilot screen in parallel in both the 2D and 3D assays. These data indicate that this technique can be readily applied to support large-scale drug screening relying on clinically relevant, ex vivo 3D tumor models directly harvested from patients, an important milestone toward personalized medicine.	
32065165        	Establishment and Analysis of Three-Dimensional (3D) Organoids Derived from Patient Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis Specimens and their Xenografts.            	Three-dimensional (3D) culture of organoids from tumor specimens of human patients and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of prostate cancer, referred to as patient-derived organoids (PDO), are an invaluable resource for studying the mechanism of tumorigenesis and metastasis of prostate cancer. Their main advantage is that they maintain the distinctive genomic and functional heterogeneity of the original tissue compared to conventional cell lines that do not. Furthermore, 3D cultures of PDO can be used to predict the effects of drug treatment on individual patients and are a step towards personalized medicine. Despite these advantages, few groups routinely use this method in part because of the extensive optimization of PDO culture conditions that may be required for different patient samples. We previously demonstrated that our prostate cancer bone metastasis PDX model, PCSD1, recapitulated the resistance of the donor patient's bone metastasis to anti-androgen therapy. We used PCSD1 3D organoids to characterize further the mechanisms of anti-androgen resistance. Following an overview of currently published studies of PDX and PDO models, we describe a step-by-step protocol for 3D culture of PDO using domed or floating basement membrane (e.g., Matrigel) spheres in optimized culture conditions. In vivo stitch imaging and cell processing for histology are also described. This protocol can be further optimized for other applications including western blot, co-culture, etc. and can be used to explore characteristics of 3D cultured PDO pertaining to drug resistance, tumorigenesis, metastasis and therapeutics.

27851739        	Designer matrices for intestinal stem cell and organoid culture.            	Epithelial organoids recapitulate multiple aspects of real organs, making them promising models of organ development, function and disease. However, the full potential of organoids in research and therapy has remained unrealized, owing to the poorly defined animal-derived matrices in which they are grown. Here we used modular synthetic hydrogel networks to define the key extracellular matrix (ECM) parameters that govern intestinal stem cell (ISC) expansion and organoid formation, and show that separate stages of the process require different mechanical environments and ECM components. In particular, fibronectin-based adhesion was sufficient for ISC survival and proliferation. High matrix stiffness significantly enhanced ISC expansion through a yes-associated protein 1 (YAP)-dependent mechanism. ISC differentiation and organoid formation, on the other hand, required a soft matrix and laminin-based adhesion. We used these insights to build a fully defined culture system for the expansion of mouse and human ISCs. We also produced mechanically dynamic matrices that were initially optimal for ISC expansion and subsequently permissive to differentiation and intestinal organoid formation, thus creating well-defined alternatives to animal-derived matrices for the culture of mouse and human stem-cell-derived organoids. Our approach overcomes multiple limitations of current organoid cultures and greatly expands their applicability in basic and clinical research. The principles presented here can be extended to identify designer matrices that are optimal for long-term culture of other types of stem cells and organoids.	
32197890        	Role of RB1 in human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids.            	Three-dimensional (3D) organoid models derived from human pluripotent stem cells provide a platform for studying human development and understanding disease mechanisms. Most studies that examine biallelic inactivation of the cell cycle regulator Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) and the link to retinoblastoma is in mice, however, less is known regarding the pathophysiological role of RB1 during human retinal development. To study the role of RB1 in early human retinal development and tumor formation, we generated retinal organoids from CRISPR/Cas9-derived RB1-null human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We showed that RB is abundantly expressed in retinal progenitor cells in retinal organoids and loss of RB1 promotes S-phase entry. Furthermore, loss of RB1 resulted in widespread apoptosis and reduced the number of photoreceptor, ganglion, and bipolar cells. Interestingly, RB1 mutation in retinal organoids did not result in retinoblastoma formation in vitro or in the vitreous body of NOD/SCID immunodeficient mice. Together, our work identifies a crucial function for RB1 in human retinal development and suggests that RB1 deletion alone is not sufficient for tumor development, at least in human retinal organoids.

29541396        	Three-dimensional organoid culture reveals involvement of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in proliferation of bladder cancer cells.            	There has been increasing awareness of the importance of three-dimensional culture of cancer cells. Tumor cells growing as multicellular spheroids in three-dimensional culture, alternatively called organoids, are widely believed to more closely mimic solid tumors in situ. Previous studies concluded that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is required for regeneration of the normal urothelium after injury and that β-catenin is upregulated in human bladder cancers, but no clear evidence has been advanced to support the idea that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is directly involved in deregulated proliferation and the other malignant characteristics of bladder cancer cells. Here we report that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator, CHIR99021, promoted proliferation of established human bladder cancer cell lines when they were grown in organoid culture but not when they were grown in conventional adherent cultures. CHIR99021 activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway in bladder cancer cell lines in organoid culture. CHIR99021 also stimulated proliferation and the Wnt/b-catenin pathway in primary human bladder cancer organoids. RNAi-mediated knockdown of β-catenin blocked growth of organoids. The effects of CHIR99021 were associated with decreased expression of the urothelial terminal differentiation marker, cytokeratin 20. Our data suggest that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is required for the proliferation of bladder cancer cells in three-dimensional organoid culture and provide a concrete example of why organoid culture is important for cancer research.	
30500538        	Long-Term Expansion of Functional Mouse and Human Hepatocytes as 3D Organoids.            	The mammalian liver possesses a remarkable regenerative ability. Two modes of damage response have been described: (1) The "oval cell" response emanates from the biliary tree when all hepatocytes are affected by chronic liver disease. (2) A massive, proliferative response of mature hepatocytes occurs upon acute liver damage such as partial hepatectomy (PHx). While the oval cell response has been captured in vitro by growing organoids from cholangiocytes, the hepatocyte proliferative response has not been recapitulated in culture. Here, we describe the establishment of a long-term 3D organoid culture system for mouse and human primary hepatocytes. Organoids can be established from single hepatocytes and grown for multiple months, while retaining key morphological, functional and gene expression features. Transcriptional profiles of the organoids resemble those of proliferating hepatocytes after PHx. Human hepatocyte organoids proliferate extensively after engraftment into mice and thus recapitulate the proliferative damage-response of hepatocytes.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

31195689        	Preclinical Modelling of PDA: Is Organoid the New Black?            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a malignancy of the exocrine pancreas with the worst prognosis among all solid tumours, and soon to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease is crucial to the development of diagnostic tools as well as to the identification of more effective therapies. High-frequency mutations in PDA occur in "undruggable" genes, and molecular subtyping based on bulk transcriptome analysis does not yet nominate valid therapeutic intervention strategies. Genome-wide sequencing studies have also demonstrated a considerable intra- and inter-patient's genetic heterogeneity, which further complicate this dire scenario. More than in other malignancies, functionalization of the PDA genome and preclinical modelling at the individual patient level appear necessary to substantially improve survival rates for pancreatic cancer patients. Traditional human PDA models, including monolayer cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts, have certainly led to valuable biological insights in the past years. However, those model systems suffer from several limitations that have contributed to the lack of concordance between preclinical and clinical studies for PDA. Pancreatic ductal organoids have recently emerged as a reliable culture system to establish models from both normal and neoplastic pancreatic tissues. Pancreatic organoid cultures can be efficiently generated from small tissue biopsies, which opens up the possibility of longitudinal studies in individual patients. A proof-of-concept study has demonstrated that patient-derived PDA organoids are able to predict responses to conventional chemotherapy. The use of this three-dimensional culture system has already improved our understanding of PDA biology and promises to implement precision oncology by enabling the alignment of preclinical and clinical platforms to guide therapeutic intervention in PDA.	
33478472        	Patient-derived organoid (PDO) platforms to facilitate clinical decision making.            	Based on recent advances in organoid research as well as the need to find more accurate models for drug screening in cancer research, patient-derived organoids have emerged as an effective in vitro model system to study cancer. Showing numerous advantages over 2D cell lines, 3D cell lines, and primary cell culture, organoids have been applied in drug screening to demonstrate the correlation between genetic mutations and sensitivity to targeted therapy. Organoids have also been used in co-clinical trials to compare drug responses in organoids to clinical responses in the corresponding patients. Numerous studies have reported the successful use of organoids to predict therapy response in cancer patients. Recently, organoids have been adopted to predict treatment response to radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The development of high throughput drug screening and organoids-on-a-chip technology can advance the use of patient-derived organoids in clinical practice and facilitate therapeutic decision-making.	
32459504        	A brief history of organoids.            	In vitro cell cultures are crucial research tools for modeling human development and diseases. Although the conventional monolayer cell cultures have been widely used in the past, the lack of tissue architecture and complexity of such model fails to inform the true biological processes in vivo. Recent advances in the organoid technology have revolutionized the in vitro culture tools for biomedical research by creating powerful three-dimensional (3D) models to recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity, structure, and functions of the primary tissues. Such organoid technology enables researchers to recreate human organs and diseases in a dish and thus holds great promises for many translational applications such as regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and precision medicine. In this review, we provide an overview of the organoid history and development. We discuss the strengths and limitations of organoids as well as their potential applications in the laboratory and the clinic.	
27044116        	Prostate epithelial cell of origin determines cancer differentiation state in an organoid transformation assay.            	The cell of origin for prostate cancer remains a subject of debate. Genetically engineered mouse models have demonstrated that both basal and luminal cells can serve as cells of origin for prostate cancer. Using a human prostate regeneration and transformation assay, our group previously demonstrated that basal cells can serve as efficient targets for transformation. Recently, a subpopulation of multipotent human luminal cells defined by CD26 expression that retains progenitor activity in a defined organoid culture was identified. We transduced primary human prostate basal and luminal cells with lentiviruses expressing c-Myc and activated AKT1 (myristoylated AKT1 or myrAKT1) to mimic theMYCamplification andPTENloss commonly detected in human prostate cancer. These cells were propagated in organoid culture before being transplanted into immunodeficient mice. We found that c-Myc/myrAKT1-transduced luminal xenografts exhibited histological features of well-differentiated acinar adenocarcinoma, with strong androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression. In contrast, c-Myc/myrAKT1-transduced basal xenografts were histologically more aggressive, with a loss of acinar structures and low/absent AR and PSA expression. Our findings imply that distinct subtypes of prostate cancer may arise from luminal and basal epithelial cell types subjected to the same oncogenic insults. This study provides a platform for the functional evaluation of oncogenes in basal and luminal epithelial populations of the human prostate. Tumors derived in this fashion with defined genetics can be used in the preclinical development of targeted therapeutics.	
31075687        	Tissue mimetic 3D scaffold for breast tumor-derived organoid culture toward personalized chemotherapy.            	Breast cancer cell lines lose the inherent gene expression profiles of their source tumor and when cultured as monolayers (two-dimensional) are unable to represent patient tumors. Thus, we engineered a biochemico- and mechano-mimetic three-dimensional (3D) culture platform for primary breast cancer cells by decellularizing cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) cultured on 3D macroporous polymer scaffolds to recapitulate tumor behavior and drug response more realistically. The presence of the CAF-derived extracellular matrix deposited on the polycaprolactone scaffold promoted cell attachment and viability, which is ascribed to higher levels of phosphorylated Focal Adhesion Kinase that mediates cell attachment via integrins. Single cells from primary breast cancers self-organized into tumoroids on prolonged culture. Response of the tumoroids to two chemotherapeutic drugs, doxorubicin and mitoxanthrone, varied significantly across patient samples. This model could be used as an ex vivo platform to culture primary cells toward developing effective and personalized chemotherapy regimens.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

29770526        	Concise Review: Current Status of Three-Dimensional Organoids as Preclinical Models.            	Three-dimensional (3D) cultures use the property of some cells to self-organize in matrices and generate structures that can be programmed to represent an organ or a pathology. Organoid cultures are the 3D cultivation of source tissue (ranging from cells to tissue fragments) in a support matrix and specialized media that nearly resembles the physiological environment. Depending on the source tissue, growth factors, and inhibitors provided, organoids can be programmed to recapitulate the biology of a system and progression of pathology. Organoids are genetically stable, and genetically amenable, making them very suitable tools to study tissue homeostasis and cancer. In this Review, we focus on providing recent technical advances from published literature to efficiently use organoids as a tool for disease modeling and therapeutics. Also, we discuss stem cell biology principles used to generate multiple organoids and their characteristics, with a brief description of methodology. A major theme of this review is to expand organoid applications to the study disease progression and drug response in different cancers. We also discuss shortcomings, limitations, and advantages of developed 3D cultures, with the rationale behind the methodology. Stem Cells 2018;36:1329-1340.                © AlphaMed Press 2018.	
30378048        	Generation and Culture of Tumor and Metastatic Organoids from Murine Models of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal malignancy that is refractory to all current therapies. Research into the mechanisms driving this cancer is the key to developing better diagnostic and treatment options which are urgently needed in the clinic. Genetically engineered mouse models of PDA have been valuable research tools, enabling studies of all stages of PDA progression. However, these models are difficult and time-consuming to breed, and engineering further mutations into these models requires additional time. Recently, organoid cultures of PDA have emerged as alternative models for this disease. Organoids can be rapidly generated from mouse models of PDA and enable genetic and biochemical perturbation of all stages of PDA progression. Here, we describe the generation and propagation of organoid models from PDA tumors and metastases harvested from genetically engineered mouse models.	
28391362        	Stem cell-derived organoids and their application for medical research and patient treatment.            	3D culture has allowed the initiation and expansion of organ-like structures, called organoids, from either tissue-resident adult stem cells or pluripotent stem cells. Today, organoids can be grown to resemble a wide variety of organs, exhibiting remarkable similarity to their in vivo counterparts. As successful organoid generation is possible from virtually every patient, organoids hold a great promise for medical research and the development of new treatments. They have already found their way into the clinic, enabling personalized medicine in small patient trials. In this review, we provide an update on current organoid technology and summarize their application in basic research, disease modelling, drug development, personalized treatment and regenerative medicine.	
32416169        	Methodological aspects and pharmacological applications of three-dimensional cancer cell cultures and organoids.            	Two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, in which cells grow in flat layers on plastic surfaces, are considered the standard model for use in drug screening and for biological assays. However, these models do not accurately represent in vivo cell organization due to a lack in cell-cell/matrix interactions and in tissue and microenvironment structure. For that reason, three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have been introduced as an innovative platform in recent years, allowing cells to grow and interact with each other in all three dimensions thanks to an artificial environment. In a 3D model cells show more interesting aspects from a physiological point of view, demonstrating several improvements in viability, morphology, proliferation and differentiations, response to external and internal stimuli, drug metabolism and efficacy and in vivo relevance. This review explores recent techniques in the development of 3D cell models with a particular focus on their application from a pharmacological point of view, starting from the concept of spheroid models generated by scaffold-free or scaffold-based techniques. Finally, special attention is paid to the concept of organoids, 3D constructs that replicate the 3D architecture of intact organs and the technology involved.                Copyright © 2020.

32898185        	Outgrowth of erlotinib-resistant subpopulations recapitulated in patient-derived lung tumor spheroids and organoids.            	A model that recapitulates development of acquired therapeutic resistance is needed to improve oncology drug development and patient outcomes. To achieve this end, we established methods for the preparation and growth of spheroids from primary human lung adenocarcinomas, including methods to culture, passage, monitor growth, and evaluate changes in mutational profile over time. Primary lung tumor spheroids were cultured in Matrigel® with varying concentrations of erlotinib, a small molecule kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is ineffective against KRAS mutant cells. Subtle changes in spheroid size and number were observed within the first two weeks of culture. Spheroids were cultured for up to 24 weeks, during which time interactions between different cell types, movement, and assembly into heterogeneous organoid structures were documented. Allele-specific competitive blocker PCR (ACB-PCR) was used to quantify low frequency BRAF V600E, KRAS G12D, KRAS G12V, and PIK3CA H1047R mutant subpopulations in tumor tissue residue (TR) samples and cultured spheroids. Mutant subpopulations, including multiple mutant subpopulations, were quite prevalent. Twelve examples of mutant enrichment were found in eight of the 14 tumors analyzed, based on the criteria that a statistically-significant increase in mutant fraction was observed relative to both the TR and the no-erlotinib control. Of the mutants quantified in erlotinib-treated cultures, PIK3CA H1047 mutant subpopulations increased most often (5/14 tumors), which is consistent with clinical observations. Thus, this ex vivo lung tumor spheroid model replicates the cellular and mutational tumor heterogeneity of human lung adenocarcinomas and can be used to assess the outgrowth of mutant subpopulations. Spheroid cultures with characterized mutant subpopulations could be used to investigate the efficacy of lung cancer combination therapies.	
31064833        	Authentic Modeling of Human Respiratory Virus Infection in Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Lung Organoids.            	Infectious viruses so precisely fit their hosts that the study of natural viral infection depends on host-specific mechanisms that affect viral infection. For human parainfluenza virus 3, a prevalent cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants, circulating human viruses are genetically different from viruses grown in standard laboratory conditions; the surface glycoproteins that mediate host cell entry on circulating viruses are suited to the environment of the human lung and differ from those of viruses grown in cultured cells. Polarized human airway epithelium cultures have been used to represent the large, proximal airways of mature adult airways. Here we modeled respiratory virus infections that occur in children or infect the distal lung using lung organoids that represent the entire developing infant lung. These 3D lung organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells contain mesoderm and pulmonary endoderm and develop into branching airway and alveolar structures. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of parainfluenza viruses replicating in the organoids showed maintenance of nucleotide identity, suggesting that no selective pressure is exerted on the virus in this tissue. Infection with parainfluenza virus led to viral shedding without morphological changes, while respiratory syncytial virus infection induced detachment and shedding of infected cells into the lung organoid lumens, reminiscent of parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus in human infant lungs. Measles virus infection, in contrast, induced syncytium formation. These human stem cell-derived lung organoids may serve as an authentic model for respiratory viral pathogenesis in the developing or infant lung, recapitulating respiratory viral infection in the host.IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses are among the first pathogens encountered by young children, and the significant impact of these viral infections on the developing lung is poorly understood. Circulating viruses are suited to the environment of the human lung and are different from those of viruses grown in cultured cells. We modeled respiratory virus infections that occur in children or infect the distal lung using lung organoids that represent the entire developing infant lung. These 3D lung organoids, derived from human pluripotent stem cells, develop into branching airway and alveolar structures and provide a tissue environment that maintains the authentic viral genome. The lung organoids can be genetically engineered prior to differentiation, thereby generating tissues bearing or lacking specific features that may be relevant to viral infection, a feature that may have utility for the study of host-pathogen interaction for a range of lung pathogens.

28442471        	Development of organoids from mouse and human endometrium showing endometrial epithelium physiology and long-term expandability.            	The endometrium, which is of crucial importance for reproduction, undergoes dynamic cyclic tissue remodeling. Knowledge of its molecular and cellular regulation is poor, primarily owing to a lack of study models. Here, we have established a novel and promising organoid model from both mouse and human endometrium. Dissociated endometrial tissue, embedded in Matrigel under WNT-activating conditions, swiftly formed organoid structures that showed long-term expansion capacity, and reproduced the molecular and histological phenotype of the tissue's epithelium. The supplemented WNT level determined the type of mouse endometrial organoids obtained: high WNT yielded cystic organoids displaying a more differentiated phenotype than the dense organoids obtained in low WNT. The organoids phenocopied physiological responses of endometrial epithelium to hormones, including increased cell proliferation under estrogen and maturation upon progesterone. Moreover, the human endometrial organoids replicated the menstrual cycle under hormonal treatment at both the morpho-histological and molecular levels. Together, we established an organoid culture system for endometrium, reproducing tissue epithelium physiology and allowing long-term expansion. This novel model provides a powerful tool for studying mechanisms underlying the biology as well as the pathology of this key reproductive organ.                © 2017.

26495796        	Optical Imaging of Drug-Induced Metabolism Changes in Murine and Human Pancreatic Cancer Organoids Reveals Heterogeneous Drug Response.            	Three-dimensional organoids derived from primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are an attractive platform for testing potential anticancer drugs on patient-specific tissue. Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) is a novel tool used to assess drug-induced changes in cellular metabolism, and its quantitative end point, the OMI index, is evaluated as a biomarker of drug response in pancreatic cancer organoids.                Optical metabolic imaging is used to assess both malignant cell and fibroblast drug response within primary murine and human pancreatic cancer organoids.                Anticancer drugs induce significant reductions in the OMI index of murine and human pancreatic cancer organoids. Subpopulation analysis of OMI data revealed heterogeneous drug response and elucidated responding and nonresponding cell populations for a 7-day time course. Optical metabolic imaging index significantly correlates with immunofluorescence detection of cell proliferation and cell death.                Optical metabolic imaging of primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma organoids is highly sensitive to drug-induced metabolic changes, provides a nondestructive method for monitoring dynamic drug response, and presents a novel platform for patient-specific drug testing and drug development.	
30607565        	Kidney and organoid single-cell transcriptomics: the end of the beginning.            	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies are increasingly being applied to reveal cellular heterogeneity in kidney development and disease. In just the last year, multiple scRNA-seq datasets have been generated from kidney organoids, developing mouse and human kidney, adult kidney, and kidney cancer. The data generated enables a much deeper understanding of biological processes within and between cells. It has also elucidated unforeseen cell lineage relationships, defined the presence of off-target cell types in kidney organoids, and revealed a diverse inflammatory response in a human kidney allograft undergoing rejection. This review summarizes the recent rapid progress in scRNA-seq of the kidney and outlines future directions for single-cell technologies as applied to the kidney.	
23803029        	Correlation between magnifying narrow-band imaging endoscopy results and organoid differentiation indicated by cancer cell differentiation and its distribution in depressed- type early gastric carcinoma.            	A close association between patterns identified by magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) and histological type has been described. M-NBI patterns were also recently reported to be related to the mucin phenotype; however, detials remain unclear.                We investigated the cellular differentiation of gastric cancer lesions, along with their mucosal distribution observed by M-NBI. Ninety-seven depressed-type early gastric cancer lesions (74 differentiated and 23 undifferentiated adenocarcinomas) were visualized by M-NBI. Findings were divided into 4 patterns based on abnormal microvascular architecture: a chain loop pattern (CLP), a fine network pattern (FNP), a corkscrew pattern (CSP), and an unclassified pattern. Mucin phenotypes were judged as gastric (G-type), intestinal (I-type), mixed gastric and intestinal (M-type), and null (N-type) based on 4 markers (MAC5AC, MUC6, MUC2, and CD10). The relationship of each pattern of microvascular architecture with organoid differentiation indicated by cancer cell differentiation and its distribution in each histological type of early gastric cancer was investigated.                All CLP and FNP lesions were differentiated. The cancer cell distribution showed organoid differentiation in 84.2% (16/19) and 61.1% (22/36) of the two types of lesions, respectively, and there was a significant difference from the unclassified pattern with organoid differentiation (p<0.001). Almost all (94.7%; 18/19) CSP lesions were undifferentiated, and organoid differentiation was observed in 72.2% (13/18). There was a significant difference from the unclassified pattern with organoid differentiation (p<0.05).                Cellular differentiation and distribution are associated with microvascular architecture observed by M-NBI.	
32583612        	Cancer Cell Invasion of Mammary Organoids with Basal-In Phenotype.            	This paper describes mammary organoids with a basal-in phenotype where the basement membrane is located on the interior surface of the organoid. A key materials consideration to induce this basal-in phenotype is the use of a minimal gel scaffold that the epithelial cells self-assemble around and encapsulate. When MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are co-cultured with epithelial cells from day 0 under these conditions, cells self-organize into patterns with distinct cancer cell populations both inside and at the periphery of the epithelial organoid. In another type of experiment, the robust formation of the basement membrane on the epithelial organoid interior enables convenient studies of MDA-MB-231 invasion in a tumor progression-relevant direction relative to epithelial cell-basement membrane positioning. That is, the study of cancer invasion through the epithelium first, followed by the basement membrane to the basal side, is realized in an experimentally convenient manner where the cancer cells are simply seeded on the outside of preformed organoids, and their invasion into the organoid is monitored. Interestingly, invasion is more prominent when tumor cells are added to day 7 organoids with less developed basement membranes compared to day 16 organoids with more defined ones.                © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

31735170        	Immunopeptidomics of colorectal cancer organoids reveals a sparse HLA class I neoantigen landscape and no increase in neoantigens with interferon or MEK-inhibitor treatment.            	Patient derived organoids (PDOs) can be established from colorectal cancers (CRCs) as in vitro models to interrogate cancer biology and its clinical relevance. We applied mass spectrometry (MS) immunopeptidomics to investigate neoantigen presentation and whether this can be augmented through interferon gamma (IFNγ) or MEK-inhibitor treatment.                Four microsatellite stable PDOs from chemotherapy refractory and one from a treatment naïve CRC were expanded to replicates with 100 million cells each, and HLA class I and class II peptide ligands were analyzed by MS.                We identified an average of 9936 unique peptides per PDO which compares favorably against published immunopeptidomics studies, suggesting high sensitivity. Loss of heterozygosity of the HLA locus was associated with low peptide diversity in one PDO. Peptides from genes without detectable expression by RNA-sequencing were rarely identified by MS. Only 3 out of 612 non-silent mutations encoded for neoantigens that were detected by MS. In contrast, computational HLA binding prediction estimated that 304 mutations could generate neoantigens. One hundred ninety-six of these were located in expressed genes, still exceeding the number of MS-detected neoantigens 65-fold. Treatment of four PDOs with IFNγ upregulated HLA class I expression and qualitatively changed the immunopeptidome, with increased presentation of IFNγ-inducible genes. HLA class II presented peptides increased dramatically with IFNγ treatment. MEK-inhibitor treatment showed no consistent effect on HLA class I or II expression or the peptidome. Importantly, no additional HLA class I or II presented neoantigens became detectable with any treatment.                Only 3 out of 612 non-silent mutations encoded for neoantigens that were detectable by MS. Although MS has sensitivity limits and biases, and likely underestimated the true neoantigen burden, this established a lower bound of the percentage of non-silent mutations that encode for presented neoantigens, which may be as low as 0.5%. This could be a reason for the poor responses of non-hypermutated CRCs to immune checkpoint inhibitors. MEK-inhibitors recently failed to improve checkpoint-inhibitor efficacy in CRC and the observed lack of HLA upregulation or improved peptide presentation may explain this.	
32396494        	The DNA methylation landscape of human cancer organoids available at the American type culture collection.            	One caveat in cancer research is the dependence of certain experimental systems that might not really reflect the properties of the primary tumours. The recent irruption of 3D cultured cells termed organoids could render a better representation of the original tumour sample. However, every laboratory has its own protocol and tissue-provider to establish these cancer models, preventing further dissemination and validation of the obtained data. To address this problem, the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI) has selected the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) to make available organoid models to the scientific community. In this regard, no epigenetic information is available for these samples and, overall, the DNA methylation profiles of human cancer organoids are largely unknown. Herein, we provide the DNA methylation landscape of 25 human cancer organoids available at the ATCC using a microarray that interrogates more than 850,000 CpG sites. We observed that the studied organoids retain the epigenetic setting of their original primary cancer type; that exhibit a DNA methylation landscape characteristic of transformed tissues excluding an overgrowth of normal-matched cells; and that are closer to the DNA methylation profiles of the corresponding primary tumours than to established 2D cell lines. Most importantly, the obtained DNA methylation results are freely available to everyone for further data mining. Thus, our findings support from the epigenetic standpoint that the ATCC human cancer organoids recapitulate many of the features of the disorder in the patient and are excellent tools to be shared among investigators for further tumour biology research.	
31996670        	Modeling medulloblastoma in vivo and with human cerebellar organoids.            	Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children and among the subtypes, Group 3 MB has the worst outcome. Here, we perform an in vivo, patient-specific screen leading to the identification of Otx2 and c-MYC as strong Group 3 MB inducers. We validated our findings in human cerebellar organoids where Otx2/c-MYC give rise to MB-like organoids harboring a DNA methylation signature that clusters with human Group 3 tumors. Furthermore, we show that SMARCA4 is able to reduce Otx2/c-MYC tumorigenic activity in vivo and in human cerebellar organoids while SMARCA4 T910M, a mutant form found in human MB patients, inhibits the wild-type protein function. Finally, treatment with Tazemetostat, a EZH2-specific inhibitor, reduces Otx2/c-MYC tumorigenesis in ex vivo culture and human cerebellar organoids. In conclusion, human cerebellar organoids can be efficiently used to understand the role of genes found altered in cancer patients and represent a reliable tool for developing personalized therapies.	
31589320        	Modeling Breast Cancer Using CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Engineering of Human Breast Organoids.            	Breast cancer is characterized by histological and functional heterogeneity, posing a clinical challenge for patient treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that the distinct subtypes reflect the repertoire of genetic alterations and the target cell. However, the precise initiating events that predispose normal epithelium to neoplasia are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that breast epithelial organoids can be generated from human reduction mammoplasties (12 out of 12 donors), thus creating a tool to study the clonal evolution of breast cancer. To recapitulate de novo oncogenesis, we exploited clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 for targeted knockout of four breast cancer-associated tumor suppressor genes (P53, PTEN, RB1, NF1) in mammary progenitor cells from six donors. Mutant organoids gained long-term culturing capacity and formed estrogen-receptor positive luminal tumors on transplantation into mice for one out of six P53/PTEN/RB1-mutated and three out of six P53/PTEN/RB1/NF1-mutated lines. These organoids responded to endocrine therapy or chemotherapy, supporting the potential utility of this model to enhance our understanding of the molecular events that culminate in specific subtypes of breast cancer.                © The Author(s) 2019.

32383524        	Challenges, applications and future directions of precision medicine in prostate cancer - the role of organoids and patient-derived xenografts.            	To provide a clinically relevant outline of various current precision medicine principles and available evidence on the application and potential for a precision medicine approach in prostate cancer.                Narrative review of the current literature in the field.                Precision medicine is the concept of individualising patient management based on specific tumour characteristics and biology, rather than traditional histological subtypes. The overall aim is to personalise management to individual patients, to provide the right cancer treatment, to the right patient, at the right time. While the approach aims to improve clinical outcomes, decrease morbidity and improve survival in men with advanced prostate cancer, its clinical application is in its infancy. It does however show great promise in this and other cancers, and will continue to be an area of active research and clinical investigation.                © 2020 The Authors BJU International © 2020 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	
27640087        	Modeling infectious diseases and host-microbe interactions in gastrointestinal organoids.            	Advances in stem cell research have allowed the development of 3-dimensional (3D) primary cell cultures termed organoid cultures, as they closely mimic the in vivo organization of different cell lineages. Bridging the gap between 2-dimensional (2D) monotypic cancer cell lines and whole organisms, organoids are now widely applied to model development and disease. Organoids hold immense promise for addressing novel questions in host-microbe interactions, infectious diseases and the resulting inflammatory conditions. Researchers have started to use organoids for modeling infection with pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori or Salmonella enteritica, gut-microbiota interactions and inflammatory bowel disease. Future studies will broaden the spectrum of microbes used and continue to establish organoids as a standard model for human host-microbial interactions. Moreover, they will increasingly exploit the unique advantages of organoids, for example to address patient-specific responses to microbes.                Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

31876640        	Characterization of a TP53 Somatic Variant of Unknown Function From an Ovarian Cancer Patient Using Organoid Culture and Computational Modeling.            	In our proof-of-concept study of 1 patient with stage IIIC carcinosarcoma of the ovary, we discovered a rare mutation in the tumor suppressor, TP53, that results in the deletion of N131. Immunofluorescence imaging of the organoid culture revealed hyperstaining of p53 protein. Computational modeling suggests this residue is important for maintaining protein conformation. Drug screening identified the combination of a proteasome inhibitor with a histone deacetylase inhibitor as the most effective treatment. These data provide evidence for the successful culture of a patient tumor and analysis of drug response ex vivo.	
29322407        	Modelling Intestinal Carcinogenesis Using In Vitro Organoid Cultures.            	Mouse models of intestinal carcinogenesis are very powerful for studying the impact of specific mutations on tumour initiation and progression. Mutations can be studied both singularly and in combination using conditional alleles that can be induced in a temporal manner. The steps in intestinal carcinogenesis are complex and can be challenging to image in live animals at a cellular level. The ability to culture intestinal epithelial tissue in three-dimensional organoids in vitro provides an accessible system that can be genetically manipulated and easily visualised to assess specific biological impacts in living tissue. Here, we describe methodology for conditional mutation of genes in organoids from genetically modified mice via induction of Cre recombinase induced by tamoxifen or by transient exposure to TAT-Cre protein. This methodology provides a rapid platform for assessing the cellular changes induced by specific mutations in intestinal tissue.	
32579880        	A Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-based Platform to Study SARS-CoV-2 Tropism and Model Virus Infection in Human Cells and Organoids.            	SARS-CoV-2 has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for physiological models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection using human disease-relevant cells. COVID-19 pathophysiology includes respiratory failure but involves other organ systems including gut, liver, heart, and pancreas. We present an experimental platform comprised of cell and organoid derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). A Spike-enabled pseudo-entry virus infects pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids, cardiomyocytes, and dopaminergic neurons. Recent clinical studies show a strong association with COVID-19 and diabetes. We find that human pancreatic beta cells and liver organoids are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, further validated using adult primary human islets and adult hepatocyte and cholangiocyte organoids. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused striking expression of chemokines, as also seen in primary human COVID-19 pulmonary autopsy samples. hPSC-derived cells/organoids provide valuable models for understanding the cellular responses of human tissues to SARS-CoV-2 infection and for disease modeling of COVID-19.

29985333        	High-sensitivity Detection of Micrometastases Generated by GFP Lentivirus-transduced Organoids Cultured from a Patient-derived Colon Tumor.            	Despite current advances in human colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, few radical therapies are effective for the late stages of CRC. To overcome this clinical challenge, tumor xenograft mouse models using long-established human carcinoma cell lines and many transgenic mouse models with tumors have been developed as preclinical models. They partially mimic the features of human carcinomas, but often fail to recapitulate the key aspects of human malignancies including invasion and metastasis. Thus, alternative models that better represent the malignant progression in human CRC have long been awaited. We herein show generation of patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) by subcutaneous implantation of small CRC fragments surgically dissected from a patient. The colon PDXs develop and histopathologically resemble the CRC in the patient. However, few spontaneous micrometastases are detectable in conventional cross-sections of affected distant organs in the PDX model. To facilitate the detection of metastatic dissemination into distant organs, we extracted the tumor organoid cells from the colon PDXs in culture and infected them with GFP lentivirus prior to injection into highly immunodeficient NOD/Shi-scid IL2Rγnull (NOG) mice. Orthotopically injected PDX-derived CRC organoid cells consistently form primary tumors positive for GFP in recipient mice. Moreover, spontaneously developing micrometastatic colonies expressing GFP are notably detected in the lungs of these mice by fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, intrasplenic injection of CRC organoids frequently produces hepatic colonization. Taken together, these findings indicate GFP-labelled PDX-derived CRC organoid cells to be visually detectable during a multistep process termed the invasion-metastasis cascade. The described protocols include the establishment of PDXs of human CRC and 3D culture of the corresponding CRC organoid cells transduced by GFP lentiviral particles.	
31332348        	Modelling liver cancer initiation with organoids derived from directly reprogrammed human hepatocytes.            	Human liver cancers, including hepatocellular carcinomas and intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas, are often diagnosed late with poor prognosis. A better understanding of cancer initiation could provide potential preventive therapies and increase survival. Models for studying human liver cancer initiation are largely missing. Here, using directly reprogrammed human hepatocytes (hiHeps) and inactivation of p53 and RB, we established organoids possessing liver architecture and function. HiHep organoids were genetically engineered to model the initial alterations in human liver cancers. Bona fide hepatocellular carcinomas were developed by overexpressing c-Myc. Excessive mitochondrion-endoplasmic reticulum coupling induced by c-Myc facilitated hepatocellular carcinoma initiation and seemed to be a target of preventive treatment. Furthermore, through the analysis of human intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma-enriched mutations, we demonstrate that the RAS-induced lineage conversion from hepatocytes to intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells can be prevented by the combined inhibition of Notch and JAK-STAT. Together, hiHep organoids represent a system that can be genetically manipulated to model cancer initiation and identify potential preventive therapies.	
31767187        	Patient-derived explants, xenografts and organoids: 3-dimensional patient-relevant pre-clinical models in endometrial cancer.            	The majority of endometrial cancers are detected early with a favourable prognosis. However, for patients with advanced disease, chemotherapy response rates and overall survival remains poor. The endometrial cancer population is typically elderly with multiple co-morbidities and aggressive cytotoxic therapy may be hazardous. Therefore, there is an urgent need to define optimal treatment strategies for advanced and recurrent disease and personalise therapy based on individual tumour and patient characteristics. Three-dimensional (3D) models that preserve the tumour microenvironment and tumour-stromal interactions are increasingly important for translational research with the advent of immunotherapy and molecularly targeted agents. 3D patient-relevant pre-clinical models in endometrial cancer include spheroids, patient-derived organoids, microfluidic systems, patient-derived xenografts and patient-derived explants. Here we present a review of available 3D modelling systems in endometrial cancers, highlighting their current use, advantages, disadvantages and applications to translational research with a focus on the power of the patient-derived explant platform.

31740922        	A novel human colon signet-ring cell carcinoma organoid line: establishment, characterization and application.            	Colon signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is a rare type of malignant dedifferentiated adenocarcinomas, and is associated with poor survival. However, an in-depth study of the biological features of SRCC is hindered by the lack of a reliable in vitro model of colon SRCC. Thus, the establishment of cell cultures from SRCC has become the most challenging task. Here, by harnessing the power of the organoid culture system, we describe the establishment of a human colon SRCC organoid line from a surgical sample from one patient with colon SRCC. The colon SRCC organoid line, YQ-173, was characterized for morphology, histology, ultrastructure and chromosome stability levels, showing that it resembles the histological and growth characteristics of the original tumor cells; xenografts were used to show that it also has a high tumor formation rate. RNA sequencing of YQ-173 compared with the normal tissue verified its mucinous nature. Capture-based targeted DNA sequencing combined with drug screening based on a bespoke 88 compound library identified that JAK2 might be a treatment target. An in vitro drug screening found that AT9283 and Pacritinib could be effective JAK2 inhibitors, which was consistent with the in vivo xenograft response. We report, for the first time, the establishment of an SRCC organoid line allowing in-depth study of SRCC biology, as well as a strategy to assess in vitro drug testing in a personalized fashion.                © The Author(s) 2019.

28912133        	Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer.            	Mutational processes underlie cancer initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes in cancer genomes may explain cancer etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of cancer-associated mutational signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that mutation accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene MLH1 is driven by replication errors and accurately models the mutation profiles observed in mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers. Application of this strategy to the cancer predisposition gene NTHL1, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a mutational footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast cancer cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline NTHL1 mutations.

31137590        	An In Vitro System for Evaluating Molecular Targeted Drugs Using Lung Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids.            	Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) represent a promising preclinical cancer model that better replicates disease, compared with traditional cell culture models. We have established PDOs from various human tumors to accurately and efficiently recapitulate the tissue architecture and function. Molecular targeted therapies with remarkable efficacy are currently in use against various tumors. Thus, there is a need for in vitro functional-potency assays that can be used to test the efficacy of molecular targeted drugs and model complex interactions between immune cells and tumor cells to evaluate the potential for cancer immunotherapy. This study represents an in vitro evaluation of different classes of molecular targeted drugs, including small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and an antibody-drug conjugate, using lung PDOs. We evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitors using a suitable high-throughput assay system. Next, the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity of an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody was evaluated to visualize the interactions of immune cells with PDOs during ADCC responses. Moreover, an evaluation system was developed for the immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, using PDOs. Our results demonstrate that the in vitro assay systems using PDOs were suitable for evaluating molecular targeted drugs under conditions that better reflect pathological conditions.	
32686114        	Single cell transcriptomes of normal endometrial derived organoids uncover novel cell type markers and cryptic differentiation of primary tumours.            	Endometrial carcinoma, the most common gynaecological cancer, develops from endometrial epithelium which is composed of secretory and ciliated cells. Pathologic classification is unreliable and there is a need for prognostic tools. We used single cell sequencing to study organoid model systems derived from normal endometrial endometrium to discover novel markers specific for endometrial ciliated or secretory cells. A marker of secretory cells (MPST) and several markers of ciliated cells (FAM92B, WDR16, and DYDC2) were validated by immunohistochemistry on organoids and tissue sections. We performed single cell sequencing on endometrial and ovarian tumours and found both secretory-like and ciliated-like tumour cells. We found that ciliated cell markers (DYDC2, CTH, FOXJ1, and p73) and the secretory cell marker MPST were expressed in endometrial tumours and positively correlated with disease-specific and overall survival of endometrial cancer patients. These findings suggest that expression of differentiation markers in tumours correlates with less aggressive disease, as would be expected for tumours that retain differentiation capacity, albeit cryptic in the case of ciliated cells. These markers could be used to improve the risk stratification of endometrial cancer patients, thereby improving their management. We further assessed whether consideration of MPST expression could refine the ProMiSE molecular classification system for endometrial tumours. We found that higher expression levels of MPST could be used to refine stratification of three of the four ProMiSE molecular subgroups, and that any level of MPST expression was able to significantly refine risk stratification of the copy number high subgroup which has the worst prognosis. Taken together, this shows that single cell sequencing of putative cells of origin has the potential to uncover novel biomarkers that could be used to guide management of cancers. © 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

33348809        	Murine- and Human-Derived Autologous Organoid/Immune Cell Co-Cultures as Pre-Clinical Models of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.            	Purpose: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the lowest five-year survival rate of all cancers in the United States. Programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1)-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibition has been unsuccessful in clinical trials. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are known to block anti-tumor CD8+ T cell immune responses in various cancers including pancreas. This has led us to our objective that was to develop a clinically relevant in vitro organoid model to specifically target mechanisms that deplete MDSCs as a therapeutic strategy for PDAC. Method: Murine and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) autologous organoid/immune cell co-cultures were used to test whether PDAC can be effectively treated with combinatorial therapy involving PD-1 inhibition and MDSC depletion. Results: Murine in vivo orthotopic and in vitro organoid/immune cell co-culture models demonstrated that polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs promoted tumor growth and suppressed cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation, leading to diminished efficacy of checkpoint inhibition. Mouse- and human-derived organoid/immune cell co-cultures revealed that PD-L1-expressing organoids were unresponsive to nivolumab in vitro in the presence of PMN-MDSCs. Depletion of arginase 1-expressing PMN-MDSCs within these co-cultures rendered the organoids susceptible to anti-PD-1/PD-L1-induced cancer cell death. Conclusions: Here we use mouse- and human-derived autologous pancreatic cancer organoid/immune cell co-cultures to demonstrate that elevated infiltration of polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs within the PDAC tumor microenvironment inhibit T cell effector function, regardless of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. We present a pre-clinical model that may predict the efficacy of targeted therapies to improve the outcome of patients with this aggressive and otherwise unpredictable malignancy.	
27632431        	Intestinal Organoids: New Frontiers in the Study of Intestinal Disease and Physiology.            	The development of sustainable intestinal organoid cell culture has emerged as a new modality for the study of intestinal function and cellular processes. Organoid culture is providing a new testbed for therapeutic research and development. Intestinal organoids, self-renewing 3-dimensional structures comprised intestinal stem cells and their differentiated epithelial progeny allow for more facile and robust exploration of cellular activity, cell organization and structure, genetic manipulation, and vastly more physiologic modeling of intestinal response to stimuli as compared to traditional 2-dimensional cell line cultures. Intestinal organoids are affecting a wide variety of research into gastrointestinal pathology. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current state-of-the-art and future effect of research using enteroids and colonoids (organoids grown from the small and large intestines, respectively).	
29140506        	Quantification of the Effect of Toxicants on the Intracellular Kinetic Energy and Cross-Sectional Area of Mammary Epithelial Organoids by OCT Fluctuation Spectroscopy.            	The ability to assess toxicant exposures of 3D in vitro mammary models that recapitulate the tissue microenvironment can aid in our understanding of environmental exposure risk over time. Longitudinal studies of 3D model systems, however, are cumbersome and suffer from a lack of high-throughput toxicological assays. In this study, we establish a noninvasive and label-free optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based imaging platform for tracking exposure-response relationships in 3D human mammary epithelial organoid models. The OCT-based assay includes metrics that quantify organoid intracellular kinetic energy and cross-sectional area (CSA). We compare the results to those obtained using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) mitochondrial dye conversion assay. Both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF7) and ER-negative (MCF10DCIS.com) breast cell lines were studied, beginning one hour after exposure and continuing for several days. Six days of exposure to 17β-estradiol or the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen respectively increased or decreased MCF7 organoid CSA (p < .01), consistent with the role of estrogen signaling in ER-positive mammary epithelial cell proliferation. We also observed a significant decrease in the intracellular kinetic energy of MCF10DCIS.com organoids after 24 h of exposure to doxorubicin, a cytotoxic intercalating agent that causes DNA double-strand breaks (p < .01). MTT-based metabolic activity of MCF10DCIS.com organoids after 48 h of doxorubicin exposure decreased with dose in a similar manner as OCT-based energy metrics. These results demonstrate the feasibility of an OCT-based assay to quantify mammary epithelial cell toxicant response in vitro, noninvasively, longitudinally, and in the context of tissue microenvironments, providing a new high-throughput screening tool for toxicological studies.	
28683005        	The Use of Endometrial Cancer Patient-Derived Organoid Culture for Drug Sensitivity Testing Is Feasible.            	Patient-derived organoids (PDOs), used in multiple tumor types, have allowed evaluation of tumor characteristics from individual patients. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of applying PDO in vitro culture for endocrine-based and drug sensitivity testing in endometrial cancer.                Endometrial cancer cells were enzymatically dissociated from tumors retrieved from fresh hysterectomy specimens and cultured within basement membrane extract in serum-free medium. An organoid growth assay was developed to assess the inhibitory effects of a variety of drugs including endocrine treatments. Organoid cultures were also prepared for histological and immunohistochemical comparison to the tumors of origin.                Fifteen endometrial cancer specimens were successfully cultured as PDOs. Small spherical structures formed within 24 hours, and many continued to grow to larger, denser organoids, providing the basis for an organoid growth assay. The STAT3 transcription factor inhibitor, BBI608 (Napabucasin), strongly inhibited growth in almost all PDO cultures, suggesting that stemness programing is involved in organoid formation and/or growth. Inhibition by different growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors was observed in several PDO specimens. Four cultures were inhibited by fulvestrant, implying the importance of estrogen-receptor signaling in some PDO cultures. Organoids closely resembled their tumors of origin in both histomorphology and immunohistochemical expression.                The use of endometrial cancer PDO cultures for development of drug sensitivity testing for individual patient tumors is feasible. The potential value of the PDO model for clinical decision making will require clinical trial evaluation.	
29543559        	Spontaneous Glioblastoma Spheroid Infiltration of Early-Stage Cerebral Organoids Models Brain Tumor Invasion.            	Organoid methodology provides a platform for the ex vivo investigation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying brain development and disease. The high-grade brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is considered a cancer of unmet clinical need, in part due to GBM cell infiltration into healthy brain parenchyma, making complete surgical resection improbable. Modeling the process of GBM invasion in real time is challenging as it requires both tumor and neural tissue compartments. Here, we demonstrate that human GBM spheroids possess the ability to spontaneously infiltrate early-stage cerebral organoids (eCOs). The resulting formation of hybrid organoids demonstrated an invasive tumor phenotype that was distinct from noncancerous adult neural progenitor (NP) spheroid incorporation into eCOs. These findings provide a basis for the modeling and quantification of the GBM infiltration process using a stem-cell-based organoid approach, and may be used for the identification of anti-GBM invasion strategies.	
31814692        	Transcriptome-based molecular staging of human stem cell-derived retinal organoids uncovers accelerated photoreceptor differentiation by 9-cis retinal.            	Retinal organoids generated from human pluripotent stem cells exhibit considerable variability during differentiation. Our goals are to assess developmental maturity of the neural retina in vitro and design improved protocols based on objective criteria.                We performed transcriptome analyses of developing retinal organoids from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell lines and utilized multiple bioinformatic tools for comparative analysis. Immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and electron microscopy were employed for validation.                We show that the developmental variability in organoids was reflected in gene expression profiles and could be evaluated by molecular staging with the human fetal and adult retinal transcriptome data. We also demonstrate that the addition of 9-cis retinal, instead of the widely used all-trans retinoic acid, accelerated rod photoreceptor differentiation in organoid cultures, with higher rhodopsin expression and more mature mitochondrial morphology evident by day 120.                Our studies provide an objective transcriptome-based modality for determining the differentiation state of retinal organoids and for comparisons across different stem cell lines and platforms, which should facilitate disease modeling and evaluation of therapies in vitro.

31264257        	Establishment of an organoid bank of biliary tract and pancreatic cancers and its application for personalized therapy and future treatment.            	Biliary tract cancers and pancreatic cancers are aggressive malignancies that are difficult to diagnose early and have a poor prognosis. Patients with inoperable biliary tract and pancreatic cancers generally receive chemotherapy regimens including gemcitabine. However, the effects of these drugs are limited, and the 5-year survival rates of patients are very low. The newly developed three-dimensional culture system known as "organoid culture" allows long-term expansion of stem cells into cyst-like structures (organoids) with properties resembling those of the original tissues. We and other groups have successfully established long-term in vitro cultures of organoids derived from biliary tract and pancreatic cancers. Organoids derived from biliary tract and pancreatic cancers closely recapitulate the properties of the original tumors including genetic alterations, gene expression profiles, and histopathological structures. These patient-derived cancer organoids can be applied for drug sensitivity testing, drug screening, epigenetic therapy, and differentiation-inducing therapy to identify therapeutic agents optimal for each patient. We intend to further establish organoids derived from various cancer cases and construct an organoid bank of biliary tract and pancreatic cancers. These powerful in vitro preclinical models of refractory cancers may bridge the gap between basic research and clinical trials and allow personalized therapy for patients.                © 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.	
29760071        	PRDM1 silences stem cell-related genes and inhibits proliferation of human colon tumor organoids.            	PRDM1 is a tumor suppressor that plays an important role in B and T cell lymphomas. Our previous studies demonstrated that PRDM1β is a p53-response gene in human colorectal cancer cells. However, the function of PRDM1β in colorectal cancer cells and colon tumor organoids is not clear. Here we show that PRDM1β is a p53-response gene in human colon organoids and that low PRDM1 expression predicts poor survival in colon cancer patients. We engineered PRDM1 knockouts and overexpression clones in RKO cells and characterized the PRDM1-dependent transcript landscapes, revealing that both the α and β transcript isoforms repress MYC-response genes and stem cell-related genes. Finally, we show that forced expression of PRDM1 in human colon cancer organoids prevents the formation and growth of colon tumor organoids in vitro. These results suggest that p53 may exert tumor-suppressive effects in part through a PRDM1-dependent silencing of stem cell genes, depleting the size of the normal intestinal stem cell compartment in response to DNA damage.	
33377121        	Obtaining patient-derived cancer organoid cultures via fine-needle aspiration.            	Patient-derived tumor organoid cultures are an essential and innovative methodology for translational research. However, current techniques to establish these cultures are cumbersome, expensive, and often require irreplaceable clinical tissue from surgery or core biopsies. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) provides a minimally invasive biopsy technique commonly performed in clinical settings. Here, we provide a protocol for FNA. We have found that FNA provides a cost-effective, rapid, and streamlined method for tissue acquisition for cancer organoid culture.

28803938        	Organoids as preclinical models to improve intraperitoneal chemotherapy effectiveness for colorectal cancer patients with peritoneal metastases: Preclinical models to improve HIPEC.            	Peritoneal metastases (PM), corresponding to tumor implants into the peritoneal cavity, are associated with impaired prognosis and low responsiveness to systemic chemotherapy. A new therapeutic approach has dramatically changed the prognosis of patients with PM from colorectal cancer (CRC), consisting in the association of a complete cytoreductive surgery followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy associated to hyperthermia (HIPEC). Many drugs have been administered intraperitoneally, but no clear consensus has been approved. Therefore, relevant preclinical models are essentials for the efficient translation of treatments option into affected patients.                Organoids, the last generation of preclinical models, were used to rationalize and improve intraperitoneal chemotherapy. We tested several cytotoxics, combination, effect of hyperthermia, exposure duration and frequency.                Organoids were a representative model of response to chemotherapies used for the treatment of PM from CRC; 460mg/m2 of oxaliplatin being the most efficient cytotoxic treatment. Repeated incubations with oxaliplatin; mimicking cycles of intraperitoneal treatment, resulted in an increased efficacy.                Organoids are relevant models to study the chemosensitivity of peritoneal metastases from CRCs. These models could be used for large scale drug screening strategies or personalized medicine, for colorectal carcinoma but also for PM from other origins.

31130514        	Probing the Tumor Suppressor Function of BAP1 in CRISPR-Engineered Human Liver Organoids.            	The deubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 is a tumor suppressor, among others involved in cholangiocarcinoma. BAP1 has many proposed molecular targets, while its Drosophila homolog is known to deubiquitinate histone H2AK119. We introduce BAP1 loss-of-function by CRISPR/Cas9 in normal human cholangiocyte organoids. We find that BAP1 controls the expression of junctional and cytoskeleton components by regulating chromatin accessibility. Consequently, we observe loss of multiple epithelial characteristics while motility increases. Importantly, restoring the catalytic activity of BAP1 in the nucleus rescues these cellular and molecular changes. We engineer human liver organoids to combine four common cholangiocarcinoma mutations (TP53, PTEN, SMAD4, and NF1). In this genetic background, BAP1 loss results in acquisition of malignant features upon xenotransplantation. Thus, control of epithelial identity through the regulation of chromatin accessibility appears to be a key aspect of BAP1's tumor suppressor function. Organoid technology combined with CRISPR/Cas9 provides an experimental platform for mechanistic studies of cancer gene function in a human context.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

29736724        	Testing Susceptibility of Patient-Derived Organoid Cultures to Therapies: Pharmacotyping.            	Increasingly, patient models of disease are being utilized to facilitate precision medicine approaches through molecular characterization or direct chemotherapeutic testing. Organoids, 3-dimensional (3D) cultures of neoplastic cells derived from primary tumor specimens, represent an ideal platform for these types of studies because benchtop protocols previously developed for 2-dimensional cell lines can be adapted for use. These protocols include directly testing the survival of these organoid cultures when exposed to clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents, a process we have called pharmacotyping. In this protocol, established tumor-derived organoid cultures are dissociated into single cells, plated in a 3D gel matrix, and exposed to pharmacologic agents. While our protocol has been developed for use with patient-derived pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma organoids, with minor modifications to the dissociation and medium conditions, this protocol could be adapted for use with a wide range of organoid cultures. We further describe our standard ATP-based assay to determine cellular survival. This protocol can be scaled for use in high-throughput assays.	
31518145        	Impacting Pancreatic Cancer Therapy in Heterotypic in Vitro Organoids and in Vivo Tumors with Specificity-Tuned, NIR-Activable Photoimmunonanoconjugates: Towards Conquering Desmoplasia?            	Despite untiring efforts to develop therapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), survival statistics remain dismal, necessitating distinct approaches. Photodynamic priming (PDP), which improves drug delivery and combination regimens, as well as tumor photodestruction are key attributes of photodynamic therapy (PDT), making it a distinctive clinical option for PDAC. Localized, high-payload nanomedicine-assisted delivery of photosensitizers (PSs), with molecular specificity and controlled photoactivation, thus becomes critical in order to reduce collateral toxicity during more expansive photodynamic activation procedures with curative intent. As such, targeted photoactivable lipid-based nanomedicines are an ideal candidate but have failed to provide greater than two-fold cancer cell selectivity, if at all, due to their extensive multivariant physical, optical, and chemical complexity. Here, we report (1) a systematic multivariant tuning approach to engineer (Cet, anti-EGFR mAb) photoimmunonanoconjugates (PINs), and (2) stroma-rich heterotypic PDAC in vitro and in vivo models incorporating patient-derived pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts (PCAFs) that recapitulate the desmoplasia observed in the clinic. These offer a comprehensive, disease-specific framework for the development of Cet-PINs. Specificity-tuning of the PINs, in terms of PS lipid anchoring, electrostatic modulation, Cet orientation, and Cet surface densities, achieved ∼16-fold binding specificities and rapid penetration of the heterotypic organoids within 1 h, thereby providing a ∼16-fold enhancement in molecular targeted NIR photodestruction. As a demonstration of their inherent amenability for multifunctionality, encapsulation of high payloads of gemcitabine hydrochloride, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin within the Cet-PINs further improved their antitumor efficacy in the heterotypic organoids. In heterotypic desmoplastic tumors, the Cet-PINs efficiently penetrated up to 470 μm away from blood vessels, and photodynamic activation resulted in substantial tumor necrosis, which was not elicited in T47D tumors (low EGFR) or when using untargeted constructs in both tumor types. Photodynamic activation of the Cet-PINs in the heterotypic desmoplastic tumors resulted in collagen photomodulation, with a 1.5-fold reduction in collagen density, suggesting that PDP may also hold potential for conquering desmoplasia. The in vivo safety profile of photodynamic activation of the Cet-PINs was also substantially improved, as compared to the untargeted constructs. While treatment using the Cet-PINs did not cause any detriment to the mice's health or to healthy proximal tissue, photodynamic activation of untargeted constructs induced severe acute cachexia and weight loss in all treated mice, with substantial peripheral skin necrosis, muscle necrosis, and bowel perforation. This study is the first report demonstrating the true value of molecular targeting for NIR-activable PINs. These constructs integrate high payload delivery, efficient photodestruction, molecular precision, and collagen photomodulation in desmoplastic PDAC tumors in a single treatment using a single construct. Such combined PIN platforms and heterocellular models open up an array of further multiplexed combination therapies to synergistically control desmoplastic tumor progression and extend PDAC patient survival.	
25201530        	Organoid cultures derived from patients with advanced prostate cancer.            	The lack of in vitro prostate cancer models that recapitulate the diversity of human prostate cancer has hampered progress in understanding disease pathogenesis and therapy response. Using a 3D organoid system, we report success in long-term culture of prostate cancer from biopsy specimens and circulating tumor cells. The first seven fully characterized organoid lines recapitulate the molecular diversity of prostate cancer subtypes, including TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, SPOP mutation, SPINK1 overexpression, and CHD1 loss. Whole-exome sequencing shows a low mutational burden, consistent with genomics studies, but with mutations in FOXA1 and PIK3R1, as well as in DNA repair and chromatin modifier pathways that have been reported in advanced disease. Loss of p53 and RB tumor suppressor pathway function are the most common feature shared across the organoid lines. The methodology described here should enable the generation of a large repertoire of patient-derived prostate cancer lines amenable to genetic and pharmacologic studies.

26738962        	Drug response in organoids generated from frozen primary tumor tissues.            	Primary tumor organoids grown in three-dimensional culture provide an excellent platform for studying tumor progression, invasion, and drug response. However, organoid generation protocols require fresh tumor tissue, which limits organoid research and clinical use. This study investigates cellular morphology, viability, and drug response of organoids derived from frozen tissues. The results demonstrate that viable organoids can be grown from flash-frozen and thawed tissue and from bulk tissues slowly frozen in DMSO supplemented media. While the freezing process affects the basal metabolic rate of the cells, the optical metabolic imaging index correlates between organoids derived from fresh and frozen tissue and can be used to detect drug response of organoids grown from frozen tissues. The slow, DMSO frozen tissue yielded organoids with more accurate drug response than the flash frozen tissues, and thus bulk tissue should be preserved for subsequent organoid generation by slow freezing in DMSO supplemented media.	
28337708        	Intestinal Crypt Organoid: Isolation of Intestinal Stem Cells, In Vitro Culture, and Optical Observation.            	The isolation and culture of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) was first demonstrated in the very recent decade with the identification of ISC marker Lgr5. The growth of ISCs into crypt organoids provides an in vitro model for studying the mucosal physiology, intestinal cancer tumorigenesis, and intestinal regeneration. Here, we describe two different isolation protocols and demonstrate a fixation method that aids in the confocal observation of the organoids.	
31685987        	Epigenetic remodelling licences adult cholangiocytes for organoid formation and liver regeneration.            	Following severe or chronic liver injury, adult ductal cells (cholangiocytes) contribute to regeneration by restoring both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. We recently showed that ductal cells clonally expand as self-renewing liver organoids that retain their differentiation capacity into both hepatocytes and ductal cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which adult ductal-committed cells acquire cellular plasticity, initiate organoids and regenerate the damaged tissue remain largely unknown. Here, we describe that ductal cells undergo a transient, genome-wide, remodelling of their transcriptome and epigenome during organoid initiation and in vivo following tissue damage. TET1-mediated hydroxymethylation licences differentiated ductal cells to initiate organoids and activate the regenerative programme through the transcriptional regulation of stem-cell genes and regenerative pathways including the YAP-Hippo signalling. Our results argue in favour of the remodelling of genomic methylome/hydroxymethylome landscapes as a general mechanism by which differentiated cells exit a committed state in response to tissue damage.	
28453760        	Long-term Inflammation Transforms Intestinal Epithelial Cells of Colonic Organoids.            	Patients with ulcerative colitis [UC] are at an increased risk of developing colitis-associated cancer [CAC], suggesting that continuous inflammation in the colon promotes the transformation of colonic epithelial cells. However, the mechanisms underlying cell transformation in UC remain unknown. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of long-term inflammation on intestinal epithelial cells [IECs] using organoid culture.                IECs were isolated from mouse colon, and were cultured according to a method for a three-dimensional [3D] organoid culture. To mimic chronic inflammation, a mixture of cytokines and bacterial components were added to the medium for over a year. Cell signal intensity was assessed by 3D immunofluorescence. Cell transformation was assessed by microarray with gene set enrichment analysis.                Stimulation with cytokines resulted in a significant induction of target genes for the nuclear factor [NF]-κB pathway in colonic organoids. Following 60 weeks of continuous stimulation, cell differentiation was suppressed. Continuous stimulation also resulted in significant amplification of NF-κB signalling. Amplified NF-κB signalling by long-term stimulation remained in colonic organoids even 11 weeks after the removal of all cytokines. Some genes were specifically upregulated only in colonic organoids after the removal all cytokines following long-term stimulation.                Colonic organoids stimulated with cytokines for a prolonged period were established as in vitro model to assess long-term epithelial responses to inflammatory cytokines. Chronic inflammation led to sustained NF-κB signalling activation in colonic organoids, resulting in cell transformation that might be related to the carcinogenesis of CAC in UC.

32123335        	Fast and efficient generation of knock-in human organoids using homology-independent CRISPR-Cas9 precision genome editing.            	CRISPR-Cas9 technology has revolutionized genome editing and is applicable to the organoid field. However, precise integration of exogenous DNA sequences into human organoids is lacking robust knock-in approaches. Here, we describe CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-independent organoid transgenesis (CRISPR-HOT), which enables efficient generation of knock-in human organoids representing different tissues. CRISPR-HOT avoids extensive cloning and outperforms homology directed repair (HDR) in achieving precise integration of exogenous DNA sequences into desired loci, without the necessity to inactivate TP53 in untransformed cells, which was previously used to increase HDR-mediated knock-in. CRISPR-HOT was used to fluorescently tag and visualize subcellular structural molecules and to generate reporter lines for rare intestinal cell types. A double reporter-in which the mitotic spindle was labelled by endogenously tagged tubulin and the cell membrane by endogenously tagged E-cadherin-uncovered modes of human hepatocyte division. Combining tubulin tagging with TP53 knock-out revealed that TP53 is involved in controlling hepatocyte ploidy and mitotic spindle fidelity. CRISPR-HOT simplifies genome editing in human organoids.	
32091578        	OrgDyn: feature- and model-based characterization of spatial and temporal organoid dynamics.            	Organoid model systems recapitulate key features of mammalian tissues and enable high throughput experiments. However, the impact of these experiments may be limited by manual, non-standardized, static or qualitative phenotypic analysis. OrgDyn is an open-source and modular pipeline to quantify organoid shape dynamics using a combination of feature- and model-based approaches on time series of 2D organoid contour images. Our pipeline consists of (i) geometrical and signal processing feature extraction, (ii) dimensionality reduction to differentiate dynamical paths, (iii) time series clustering to identify coherent groups of organoids and (iv) dynamical modeling using point distribution models to explain temporal shape variation. OrgDyn can characterize, cluster and model differences among unique dynamical paths that define diverse final shapes, thus enabling quantitative analysis of the molecular basis of tissue development and disease.                https://github.com/zakih/organoidDynamics (BSD 3-Clause License).

33492660        	Organoid technology for personalized pancreatic cancer therapy.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has the lowest survival rate among all major cancers and is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The stagnant survival statistics and dismal response rates to current therapeutics highlight the need for more efficient preclinical models. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) offer new possibilities as powerful preclinical models able to account for interpatient variability. Organoid development can be divided into four different key phases: establishment, propagation, drug screening and response prediction. Establishment entails tailored tissue extraction and growth protocols, propagation requires consistent multiplication and passaging, while drug screening and response prediction will benefit from shorter and more precise assays, and clear decision-making tools.                This review attempts to outline the most important challenges that remain in exploiting organoid platforms for drug discovery and clinical applications. Some of these challenges may be overcome by novel methods that are under investigation, such as 3D bioprinting systems, microfluidic systems, optical metabolic imaging and liquid handling robotics. We also propose an optimized organoid workflow inspired by all technical solutions we have presented.	
31274205        	The Emergence of Stem Cell-Based Brain Organoids: Trends and Challenges.            	Recent developments in 3D cultures exploiting the self-organization ability of pluripotent stem cells have enabled the generation of powerful in vitro systems termed brain organoids. These 3D tissues recapitulate many aspects of human brain development and disorders occurring in vivo. When combined with improved differentiation methods, these in vitro systems allow the generation of more complex "assembloids," which are able to reveal cell diversities, microcircuits, and cell-cell interactions within their 3D organization. Here, the ways in which human brain organoids have contributed to demystifying the complexities of brain development and modeling of developmental disorders is reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, challenging questions that are yet to be addressed by emerging brain organoid research are discussed.                © 2019 The Authors. BioEssays Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
29311127        	Kras in Organoids.            	Oncogenic Kras are genetic dependencies for the majority of pancreatic and colorectal adenocarcinomas; however, much remains to be understood regarding its tropism to these carcinomas. Recently developed organoid technology presents a more representative model culture system for pancreatic and colon epithelial tissues as well as better fostering the culture of nonimmortalized cells than two-dimensional culture. These advantages enable cancer researchers to directly compare tumor and normal tissue models to better study tumor initiation as well as therapeutic efficacy. Although in vivo models better model the complexity of multiple cell types, the organoid system allows for easier genetic manipulations and isolation of specific cell types. Furthermore, syngeneic orthotopically transplanted organoids recapitulate tumor histologically and gene expression of the tumors from which they were derived. Thus, organoids may extend the use of genetically engineered mouse models. These advantages of organoid cultures allow for many questions, including but not limited to studying the interaction between different cell types within a tumor and elucidating dependencies of Kras-driven tumors.

32822897        	Drug screening model meets cancer organoid technology.            	Tumor organoids inherit the genomic and molecular characteristics of the donor tumor, which not only bridge the gap between genome and phenotype but also circumvent the disadvantages such as genetic information change by using 2D cell lines and the mouse-specific tumor evolution in patient-derived xenograft (PDX). So, cancer organoid has been widely applied to preclinical drug evaluation, biomarker identification, biological research, and individualized therapy. Besides, cancer organoid can be preserved, resuscitated, passed infinitely, and mechanically cultured on a chip for drug screening; it has become one of the partial models for low/high-throughput drug screening in the preclinical trial in vitro. Therefore, this review presents the recent developments of tumor organoids for drug screening, which will introduce from four aspects, including the stability/credibility, types, application, deficiency and prospect of the tumor organoids model for drug screening.

31875622        	Organoids: Avatars for Personalized Medicine.            	Stem cells are the foundation of all mammalian life. Stem cells build and maintain our bodies throughout life. Two types of stem cells are discerned.1) Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are briefly present in the early human or mouse embryo, a few days after fertilization. These ES cells can be grown indefinitely in the lab and have the potential to build each and every tissue in our body. Because of this 'pluripotency', ES cells hold great promise for therapeutic application in the field of regenerative medicine. It is also possible to take skin cells (or other cells) from adults and convert these in the lab into cells with ES properties, so called iPS cells. Many of the hurdles that ES cell technology have faced, do not exist for iPS cells.2) Adult stem cells. Every organ in our body is believed to harbor its own dedicated stem cells. These adult stem cells replace tissue that is lost due to wear and tear, trauma and disease. Adult stem cells are highly specialized and can only produce the tissue in which they reside; they are 'multipotent'. Examples are bone marrow stem cells that make all blood cells, skin stem cells and gut stem cells. Even the brain is now known to harbor its specialized stem cells. The adult stem cells allow us to live 80-90 years, but this comes at a cost: they are the cells that most easily transform into cancer cells.Both types of stem cells can be used to establish 'organoids', 3D structures established in a dish, that recapitulate many aspects of the organ they represent. Pluripotent stem cells can be taken through the developmental steps that establish organs during embryogenesis. This has worked particularly well for parts of the the central nervous system, the kidney and GI organs. We have shown that adult epithelial stem cells carrying the generic Lgr5 marker can be cultured under tissue-repair conditions and generate epithelial organoids directly from healthy and diseased organs such as the gut, the liver, the lung and the pancreas. Organoid technology opens a range of avenues for the study of development, physiology and disease, for drug development and for personalized medicine. In the long run, cultured mini-organs may replace transplant organs from donors and hold promise in gene therapy.	
31668851        	Morphological and Molecular Defects in Human Three-Dimensional Retinal Organoid Model of X-Linked Juvenile Retinoschisis.            	X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS), linked to mutations in the RS1 gene, is a degenerative retinopathy with a retinal splitting phenotype. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from patients to study XLRS in a 3D retinal organoid in vitro differentiation system. This model recapitulates key features of XLRS including retinal splitting, defective retinoschisin production, outer-segment defects, abnormal paxillin turnover, and impaired ER-Golgi transportation. RS1 mutation also affects the development of photoreceptor sensory cilia and results in altered expression of other retinopathy-associated genes. CRISPR/Cas9 correction of the disease-associated C625T mutation normalizes the splitting phenotype, outer-segment defects, paxillin dynamics, ciliary marker expression, and transcriptome profiles. Likewise, mutating RS1 in control hiPSCs produces the disease-associated phenotypes. Finally, we show that the C625T mutation can be repaired precisely and efficiently using a base-editing approach. Taken together, our data establish 3D organoids as a valid disease model.                Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
33377132        	An Automated Organoid Platform with Inter-organoid Homogeneity and Inter-patient Heterogeneity.            	Current organoid technologies require intensive manual manipulation and lack uniformity in organoid size and cell composition. We present here an automated organoid platform that generates uniform organoid precursors in high-throughput. This is achieved by templating from monodisperse Matrigel droplets and sequentially delivering them into wells using a synchronized microfluidic droplet printer. Each droplet encapsulates a certain number of cells (e.g., 1,500 cells), which statistically represent the heterogeneous cell population in a tumor section. The system produces >400-μm organoids within 1 week with both inter-organoid homogeneity and inter-patient heterogeneity. This enables automated organoid printing to obtain one organoid per well. The organoids recapitulate 97% gene mutations in the parental tumor and reflect the patient-to-patient variation in drug response and sensitivity, from which we obtained more than 80% accuracy among the 21 patients investigated. This organoid platform is anticipated to fulfill the personalized medicine goal of 1-week high-throughput screening for cancer patients.                © 2020 The Author(s).	
32375033        	Challenges in Establishing Pure Lung Cancer Organoids Limit Their Utility for Personalized Medicine.            	Clinical implementation of tumor organoids for personalized medicine requires that pure tumor organoids can be reliably established. Here, we present our experience with organoid cultures from >70 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples. We systematically evaluate several methods to identify tumor purity of organoids established from intrapulmonary tumors. Eighty percent of organoids from intrapulmonary lesions have a normal copy number profile, suggesting overgrowth by normal airway organoids (AOs). This is further supported by the failure to detect mutations found in the original tumor in organoids. Histomorphology alone is insufficient to determine tumor purity, but when combined with p63 immunostaining, tumor and normal AOs can be distinguished. Taking into account overgrowth by normal AOs, the establishment rate of pure NSCLC organoids is 17%. Therefore, current methods are insufficient to establish pure NSCLC organoids from intrapulmonary lesions. We discourage their use unless steps are taken to prevent overgrowth by normal AOs.                Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
27212702        	A Colorectal Tumor Organoid Library Demonstrates Progressive Loss of Niche Factor Requirements during Tumorigenesis.            	Colorectal tumor is a heterogeneous disease, with varying clinical presentation and prognosis in patients. To establish a platform encompassing this diversity, we generated 55 colorectal tumor organoid lines from a range of histological subtypes and clinical stages, including rare subtypes. Each line was defined by gene expression signatures and optimized for organoid culture according to niche factor requirements. In vitro and in xenografts, the organoids reproduced the histopathological grade and differentiation capacity of their parental tumors. Notably, we found that niche-independent growth is predominantly associated with the adenoma-carcinoma transition reflecting accumulation of multiple mutations. For matched pairs of primary and metastatic organoids, which had similar genetic profiles and niche factor requirements, the metastasis-derived organoids exhibited higher metastatic capacity. These observations underscore the importance of genotype-phenotype analyses at a single-patient level and the value of our resource to provide insights into colorectal tumorigenesis and patient-centered therapeutic development.

31300517        	Liver organoids: from basic research to therapeutic applications.            	Organoid cultures have emerged as an alternative in vitro system to recapitulate tissues in a dish. While mouse models and cell lines have furthered our understanding of liver biology and associated diseases, they suffer in replicating key aspects of human liver tissue, in particular its complex architecture and metabolic functions. Liver organoids have now been established for multiple species from induced pluripotent stem cells, embryonic stem cells, hepatoblasts and adult tissue-derived cells. These represent a promising addition to our toolbox to gain a deeper understanding of this complex organ. In this perspective we will review the advances in the liver organoid field, its limitations and potential for biomedical applications.                © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

30487605        	Trophoblast organoids as a model for maternal-fetal interactions during human placentation.            	The placenta is the extraembryonic organ that supports the fetus during intrauterine life. Although placental dysfunction results in major disorders of pregnancy with immediate and lifelong consequences for the mother and child, our knowledge of the human placenta is limited owing to a lack of functional experimental models1. After implantation, the trophectoderm of the blastocyst rapidly proliferates and generates the trophoblast, the unique cell type of the placenta. In vivo, proliferative villous cytotrophoblast cells differentiate into two main sub-populations: syncytiotrophoblast, the multinucleated epithelium of the villi responsible for nutrient exchange and hormone production, and extravillous trophoblast cells, which anchor the placenta to the maternal decidua and transform the maternal spiral arteries2. Here we describe the generation of long-term, genetically stable organoid cultures of trophoblast that can differentiate into both syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast. We used human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing to confirm that the organoids were derived from the fetus, and verified their identities against four trophoblast-specific criteria3. The cultures organize into villous-like structures, and we detected the secretion of placental-specific peptides and hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) by mass spectrometry. The organoids also differentiate into HLA-G+ extravillous trophoblast cells, which vigorously invade in three-dimensional cultures. Analysis of the methylome reveals that the organoids closely resemble normal first trimester placentas. This organoid model will be transformative for studying human placental development and for investigating trophoblast interactions with the local and systemic maternal environment.	
28968550        	Esophageal Adenocarcinoma-Derived Extracellular Vesicle MicroRNAs Induce a Neoplastic Phenotype in Gastric Organoids.            	There have been no reports describing the effects of cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on three-dimensional organoids. In this study, we delineated the proneoplastic effects of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)-derived EVs on gastric organoids (gastroids) and elucidated molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. EVs were identified using PKH-67 staining. Morphologic changes, Ki-67 immunochemistry, cell viability, growth rates, and expression levels of miR-25 and miR-210, as well as of their target mRNAs, were determined in gastroids co-cultured with EAC-derived extracellular vesicles (c-EVs). C-EVs were efficiently taken up by gastroids. Notably, c-EV-treated gastroids were more crowded, compact, and multilayered and contained smaller lumens than did those cultured in organoid medium alone or in EAC-conditioned medium that had been depleted of EVs. Moreover, c-EV-treated gastroids manifested increased proliferation and cellular viability relative to medium-only or EV-depleted controls. Expression levels of miR-25 and miR-210 were significantly higher, and those of PTEN and AIFM3 significantly lower, in c-EV-treated versus medium-only or EV-depleted control groups. Inhibitors of miR-25 and miR-210 reversed the increased cell proliferation induced by c-exosomes in co-cultured gastroids by lowering miR-25 and miR-210 levels. In conclusion, we have constructed a novel model system featuring the co-culture of c-EVs with three-dimensional gastroids. Using this model, we discovered that cancer-derived EVs induce a neoplastic phenotype in gastroids. These changes are due, at least in part, to EV transfer of miR-25 and miR-210.

31572675        	Development of Patient-Derived Preclinical Platform for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: PDOX and a Subsequent Organoid Model System Using Percutaneous Biopsy Samples.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal malignant tumor and more than 50% patients are diagnosed at metastatic stage. The preclinical model systems that reflect the genetic heterogeneity of metastatic tumors are urgently needed to guide optimal treatment. This study describes the development of patient-derived preclinical platform using very small sized-percutaneous liver gun biopsy (PLB) of metastatic pancreatic cancer, based on patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-mediated tissue amplification and subsequent organoid generation. To increase the success rate and shorten the tumor growth period, patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model was developed to directly implant threadlike PLB samples into the pancreas. The engraftment success rate of PDOX samples from 35 patients with metastatic PDAC was 47%, with these samples showing the potential to metastasize to distant organs, as in patients. The PDOX models retained the genetic alterations and histopathological features of the primary tumors. Tumor organoids were subsequently generated from first passage cancer cells isolated from F1 tumor tissue of PDOX that preserve the epithelial cancer characteristics and KRAS mutations of primary tumors. The response to gemcitabine of PDOX-derived organoids correlated with clinical outcomes in corresponding patients as well as PDOX models in vivo, suggesting that this PDOX-organoid system reflects clinical conditions. Collectively, these findings indicate that the proposed PDOX-organoid platform using PLB samples assessed both in vitro and in vivo could predict drug response under conditions closer to those found in actual patients, as well as enhancing understanding of the complexity of metastatic PDAC.

28292837        	The hope and the hype of organoid research.            	The recent increase in organoid research has been met with great enthusiasm, as well as expectation, from the scientific community and the public alike. There is no doubt that this technology opens up a world of possibilities for scientific discovery in developmental biology as well as in translational research, but whether organoids can truly live up to this challenge is, for some, still an open question. In this Spotlight article, Meritxell Huch and Juergen Knoblich begin by discussing the exciting promise of organoid technology and give concrete examples of how this promise is starting to be realised.

30591933        	Organoid models of gastrointestinal Neoplasms: Origin, current status and future applications in personalized medicine.            	The in vitro organoid model is a major technological breakthrough that has been established as an important tool in many basic biological and clinical applications. This near-physiological 3D culture system accurately models various biological processes, including tissue renewal, stem cell/niche functions and tissue responses to drugs, mutations or damage. Organoids have the potential value of being an accurate model for disease predictions or drug screening applications and to identify the ideal treatment for that patient. Carcinogenesis can be modeled by mutating specific cancer genes in wild-type organoids; and patient-derived organoids provide an important resource in the development of personalized cancer treatment. Organoids from cancer patients could be used to identify the ideal treatment for a specific patient by growing matched healthy and diseased organoids from human cancer patients which additionally enables clinical screens for drug combinations. Organoids could also provide autologous cells or-in the future-tissue for transplantation. In this review, we discuss the current advances, challenges and potential applications of this technique in gastrointestinal neoplasms.	
32636524        	Human organoids: model systems for human biology and medicine.            	The historical reliance of biological research on the use of animal models has sometimes made it challenging to address questions that are specific to the understanding of human biology and disease. But with the advent of human organoids - which are stem cell-derived 3D culture systems - it is now possible to re-create the architecture and physiology of human organs in remarkable detail. Human organoids provide unique opportunities for the study of human disease and complement animal models. Human organoids have been used to study infectious diseases, genetic disorders and cancers through the genetic engineering of human stem cells, as well as directly when organoids are generated from patient biopsy samples. This Review discusses the applications, advantages and disadvantages of human organoids as models of development and disease and outlines the challenges that have to be overcome for organoids to be able to substantially reduce the need for animal experiments.	
24115167        	Development of intestinal organoids as tissue surrogates: cell composition and the epigenetic control of differentiation.            	Intestinal organoids are multicellular crypt-like structures that can be derived from adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs). Here we show that intestinal organoids generated from mouse ESCs were enriched in ISCs and early progenitors. Treatment of these organoids with a γ-secretase inhibitor increased Math1 and decreased Hes1 expression, indicating Notch signaling regulates ISC differentiation in these organoids. Lgr5 and Tert positive ISCs constituted approximately 10% and 20% of the organoids. As found in native tissue, Lgr5 and Tert expressing cells resolved into two discreet populations, which were stable over time. Intestinal organoids derived from cancer-prone Apc(Min/+) mice showed similar numbers of ISCs, but had reduced Math1 expression, indicating a suppressed secretory cell differentiation potential (as found in intestinal tissue). Apc(Min/+) organoids were used to screen epigenetically active compounds for those that increased Math1 expression and organoid differentiation (including HDAC inhibitors, Sirtuin (SIRT) modulators and methyltransferase inhibitors). Broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors increased both Math1 and Muc2 expression, indicating an ability to promote the suppressed secretory cell differentiation pathway. Other epigenetic compounds had a diverse impact on cell differentiation, with a strong negative correlation between those that activated the secretory marker Muc2 and those that activated the absorptive cell marker Fabp2. These data show that ESC-derived intestinal organoids can be derived in large numbers, contain distinct ISC types and can be used to screen for agents that promote cell differentiation through different lineage pathways.                © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
27590622        	Human glandular organoid formation in murine engineering chambers after collagenase digestion and flow cytometry isolation of normal human breast tissue single cells.            	Women with high mammographic density (MD) are at increased risk of breast cancer (BC) after adjustment for age and body mass index. We have developed a murine biochamber model in which both high MD (HMD) and low MD (LMD) tissue can be propagated. Here, we tested whether cells isolated by collagenase digestion and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from normal breast can be reconstituted in our biochamber model, which would allow cell-specific manipulations to be tested. Fresh breast tissue was collected from women (n = 7) undergoing prophylactic mastectomy. The tissue underwent collagenase digestion overnight and, in some cases, additional FACS enrichment to obtain mature epithelial, luminal progenitor, mammary stem, and stromal cells. Cells were then transferred bilaterally into biochambers in SCID mice (n = 5-7) and incubated for 6 weeks, before harvesting for histological analyses, and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins (CK), vimentin, Ki-67, murine macrophages, and Cleaved Caspase-3. Biochambers inoculated with single cells after collagenase digestion or with flow cytometry contained glandular structures of human origin (human vimentin-positive), which expressed CK-14 and pan-CK, and were proliferating (Ki-67-positive). Glandular structures from the digested tissues were smaller than those in chambers seeded with finely chopped intact mammary tissue. Mouse macrophage infiltration was higher in the chambers arising from digested tissues. Pooled single cells and FACS fractionated cells were viable in the murine biochambers and formed proliferating glandular organoids of human origin. This is among the first report to demonstrate the success of formed human glandular organoids from isolated primary mammary cells in the murine biochamber model.                © 2016 International Federation for Cell Biology.	
31951625        	Modeling the effect of prolonged ethanol exposure on global gene expression and chromatin accessibility in normal 3D colon organoids.            	In this study we aimed to explore the potential biological effect of ethanol exposure on healthy colon epithelial cells using normal human colon 3D organoid "mini-gut" cultures. In numerous published studies ethanol use has been shown to be an environmental risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) development; however, the influence of ethanol exposure on normal colon epithelial cell biology remains poorly understood. We investigated the potential molecular effects of ethanol exposure in normal colon 3D organoids in a small pilot study (n = 3) using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. We identify 1965 differentially expressed genes and 2217 differentially accessible regions of chromatin in response to ethanol treatment. Further, by cross-referencing our results with previously published analysis in colorectal cancer cell lines, we have not only validated a number of reported differentially expressed genes, but also identified several novel candidates for future investigation. In summary, our data highlights the potential importance for the use of normal colon 3D organoid models as a novel tool for the investigation of the relationship between the effects of environmental risk factors associated with colorectal cancer and the molecular mechanisms through which they confer this risk.	
29428171        	Human-cell-derived organoids as a new ex vivo model for drug assays in oncology.            	In oncology, a 2D in vitro model of cancer cell lines is still widely used for large-scale drug screening. However, most promising candidates firstly identified by in vitro analysis tend to fail during the next steps of drug development. The generation of an ex vivo approach termed 'organoid' is emerging as a promising preclinical model to mimic human tumors more accurately. In this review, we focus on human-derived organoid use for anticancer drug screening. We describe the development of this new in vitro model, its use for anticancer agent assays and the advantages compared with the currently used 2D models. Finally, we discuss organoid limitations in the common use of this technology during preclinical studies.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	
32243841        	Developing Organoids from Ovarian Cancer as Experimental and Preclinical Models.            	Ovarian cancer (OC) represents the most dismal gynecological cancer. Pathobiology is poorly understood, mainly due to lack of appropriate study models. Organoids, defined as self-developing three-dimensional in vitro reconstructions of tissues, provide powerful tools to model human diseases. Here, we established organoid cultures from patient-derived OC, in particular from the most prevalent high-grade serous OC (HGSOC). Testing multiple culture medium components identified neuregulin-1 (NRG1) as key factor in maximizing OC organoid development and growth, although overall derivation efficiency remained moderate (36% for HGSOC patients, 44% for all patients together). Established organoid lines showed patient tumor-dependent morphology and disease characteristics, and recapitulated the parent tumor's marker expression and mutational landscape. Moreover, the organoids displayed tumor-specific sensitivity to clinical HGSOC chemotherapeutic drugs. Patient-derived OC organoids provide powerful tools for the study of the cancer's pathobiology (such as importance of the NRG1/ERBB pathway) as well as advanced preclinical tools for (personalized) drug screening and discovery.

32068945        	Germ-free and microbiota-associated mice yield small intestinal epithelial organoids with equivalent and robust transcriptome/proteome expression phenotypes.            	Intestinal epithelial organoids established from gut tissue have become a widely used research tool. However, it remains unclear how environmental cues, divergent microbiota composition and other sources of variation before, during and after establishment confound organoid properties, and how these properties relate to the original tissue. While environmental influences cannot be easily addressed in human organoids, mice offer a controlled assay-system. Here, we probed the effect of donor microbiota differences, previously identified as a confounding factor in murine in vivo studies, on organoids. We analysed the proteomes and transcriptomes of primary organoid cultures established from two colonised and one germ-free mouse colony of C57BL/6J genetic background, and compared them to their tissue of origin and commonly used cell lines. While an imprint of microbiota-exposure was observed on the proteome of epithelial samples, the long-term global impact of donor microbiota on organoid expression patterns was negligible. Instead, stochastic culture-to-culture differences accounted for a moderate variability between independently established organoids. Integration of transcriptome and proteome datasets revealed an organoid-typic expression signature comprising 14 transcripts and 10 proteins that distinguished organoids across all donors from murine epithelial cell lines and fibroblasts and closely mimicked expression patterns in the gut epithelium. This included the inflammasome components ASC, Naip1-6, Nlrc4 and Caspase-1, which were highly expressed in all organoids compared to the reference cell line m-ICc12 or mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Taken together, these results reveal that the donor microbiota has little effect on the organoid phenotype and suggest that organoids represent a more suitable culture model than immortalised cell lines, in particular for studies of intestinal epithelial inflammasomes.                © 2020 The Authors.

31973535        	Patient-derived organoids of non-small cells lung cancer and their application for drug screening.            	Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are emerging as preclinical models with promising values in personalized cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to establish a living biobank of PDOs from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to study the responses of PDOs to drugs. PDOs derived from NSCLC were cultured in vitro, and then treated with natural compounds including chelerythrine chloride, cantharidin, harmine, berberine and betaine with series of concentrations (0.5-30 μM) for drug screening. Phenotypic features and treatment responses of established PDOs were reported. Cell lines (H1299, H460 and H1650) were used for drug screening. We successfully established a living NSCLC organoids biobank of 10 patients, which showed similar pathological features with primary tumors. Nine of the 10 patients showed mutations in EGFR. Natural compounds chelerythrine chloride, cantharidin and harmine showed anticancer activity on PDOs and cell lines. There was no significant difference in the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the IC50 value of chelerythrine chloride between PDOs (1.56-2.88 μM) and cell lines (1.45-3.73 μM, p>0.05). PDOs were sensitive to berberine (95% CI, 0.092-1.55 μM), whereas cell lines showed a resistance (95% CI, 46.57-2275 μM, p<0.0001). PDOs had a higher IC50 value of cantharidin, and a lower IC50 value of harmine than cell lines (p<0.05, 7.50-10.45 μM and 4.27-6.50 μM in PDOs, 3.07-4.44 μM and 4.69-544.99 μM in cell lines, respectively). Both PDOs and cell lines were resistant to betaine. Chelerythrine chloride showed the highest inhibitory effect in both models. Our study established a living biobank of PDOs from NSCLC patients, which might be used for high-throughput drug screening and for promising personalized therapy design.	
28548903        	Microenvironment of a tumor-organoid system enhances hepatocellular carcinoma malignancy-related hallmarks.            	Organ-like microenviroment and 3-dimensional (3D) cell culture conformations have been suggested as promising approaches to mimic in a micro-scale a whole organ cellular functions and interactions present in vivo. We have used this approach to examine biologic features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In this study, we demonstrate that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and extracellular matrix can generate organoid-like spheroids that enhanced numerous features of human HCC observed in vivo. We show that the addition of non-parenchymal cells such as fibroblast and endothelial cells is required for spheroid formation as well as the maintenance of the tissue-like structure. Furthermore, HCC cells cultured as spheroids with non-parenchymal cells express more neo-angiogenesis-related markers (VEGFR2, VEGF, HIF-α), tumor-related inflammatory factors (CXCR4, CXCL12, TNF-α) and molecules-related to induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (TGFβ, Vimentin, MMP9) compared with organoids containing only HCC cells. These results demonstrate the importance of non-parenchymal cells in the cellular composition of HCC organoids. The novelty of the multicellular-based organotypic culture system strongly supports the integration of this approach in a high throughput approach to identified patient-specific HCC malignancy and accurate anti-tumor therapy screening after surgery.	
31853049        	Organoids in immunological research.            	Much of our knowledge regarding the interactions between epithelial tissues and the immune system has been gathered from animal models and co-cultures with cell lines. However, unique features of human cells cannot be modelled in mice, and cell lines are often transformed or genetically immortalized. Organoid technology has emerged as a powerful tool to maintain epithelial cells in a near-native state. In this Review, we discuss how organoids are being used in immunological research to understand the role of epithelial cell-immune cell interactions in tissue development and homeostasis, as well as in diseases such as cancer.	
28292848        	Intestinal epithelial organoids fuse to form self-organizing tubes in floating collagen gels.            	Multiple recent examples highlight how stem cells can self-organize in vitro to establish organoids that closely resemble their in vivo counterparts. Single Lgr5+ mouse intestinal stem cells can be cultured under defined conditions forming ever-expanding epithelial organoids that retain cell polarization, cell type diversity and anatomical organization of the in vivo epithelium. Although exhibiting a remarkable level of self-organization, the so called 'mini-guts' have a closed cystic structure of microscopic size. Here, we describe a simple protocol to generate macroscopic intestinal tubes from small cystic organoids. Embedding proliferating organoids within a contracting floating collagen gel allows them to align and fuse to generate macroscopic hollow structures ('tubes') that are lined with a simple epithelium containing all major cell types (including functional stem cells) of the small intestine. Cells lining the central contiguous lumen closely resemble the epithelial cells on luminal villi in vivo, whereas buds that protrude from the main tube into the surrounding matrix closely resemble crypts. Thus, the remarkable self-organizing properties of Lgr5+ stem cells extend beyond the level of the microscopic cystic organoid to the next, macroscopic, level of tube formation.                © 2017.

31155505        	Therapeutic Regeneration of Lymphatic and Immune Cell Functions upon Lympho-organoid Transplantation.            	Lymph nodes (LNs) are secondary lymphoid tissues that play a critical role in filtering the lymph and promoting adaptive immune responses. Surgical resection of LNs, radiation therapy, or infections may damage lymphatic vasculature and compromise immune functions. Here, we describe the generation of functional synthetic lympho-organoids (LOs) using LN stromal progenitors and decellularized extracellular matrix-based scaffolds, two basic constituents of secondary lymphoid tissues. We show that upon transplantation at the site of resected LNs, LOs become integrated into the endogenous lymphatic vasculature and efficiently restore lymphatic drainage and perfusion. Upon immunization, LOs support the activation of antigen-specific immune responses, thus acquiring properties of native lymphoid tissues. These findings provide a proof-of-concept strategy for the development of functional lympho-organoids suitable for restoring lymphatic and immune cell functions.

27539462        	Murine Colonic Organoid Culture System and Downstream Assay Applications.            	Colonic organoids, three-dimensional colonic crypts grown in vitro that show realistic microanatomy, have many potential applications for studying physiology, developmental biology, and pathophysiology of intestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Here, we describe detailed protocols for mouse colonic crypt isolation, organoid culture, and downstream applications. Specific culture strategies including growth factor enriched Matrigel and Wnt and R-spondin conditioned media serve as key factors for enhancing the growth and cost efficiency of colonic organoid cultures.	
29286377        	The Organoid Reconstitution Assay (ORA) for the Functional Analysis of Intestinal Stem and Niche Cells.            	The intestinal epithelium is characterized by an extremely rapid turnover rate. In mammals, the entire epithelial lining is renewed within 4 - 5 days. Adult intestinal stem cells reside at the bottom of the crypts of Lieberkühn, are earmarked by expression of the Lgr5 gene, and preserve homeostasis through their characteristic high proliferative rate1. Throughout the small intestine, Lgr5+ stem cells are intermingled with specialized secretory cells called Paneth cells. Paneth cells secrete antibacterial compounds (i.e., lysozyme and cryptdins/defensins) and exert a controlling role on the intestinal flora. More recently, a novel function has been discovered for Paneth cells, namely their capacity to provide niche support to Lgr5+ stem cells through several key ligands as Wnt3, EGF, and Dll12. When isolated ex vivo and cultured in the presence of specific growth factors and extracellular matrix components, whole intestinal crypts give rise to long-lived and self-renewing 3D structures called organoids that highly resemble the crypt-villus epithelial architecture of the adult small intestine3. Organoid cultures, when established from whole crypts, allow the study of self-renewal and differentiation of the intestinal stem cell niche, though without addressing the contribution of its individual components, namely the Lgr5+ and Paneth cells. Here, we describe a novel approach to the organoid assay that takes advantage of the ability of Paneth and Lgr5+ cells to associate and form organoids when co-cultured. This approach, here referred to as "organoid reconstitution assay" (ORA), allows the genetic and biochemical modification of Paneth or Lgr5+ stem cells, followed by reconstitution into organoids. As such, it allows the functional analysis of the two main components of the intestinal stem cell niche.	
29337182        	Human Pancreatic Tumor Organoids Reveal Loss of Stem Cell Niche Factor Dependence during Disease Progression.            	Despite recent efforts to dissect the inter-tumor heterogeneity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by determining prognosis-predictive gene expression signatures for specific subtypes, their functional differences remain elusive. Here, we established a pancreatic tumor organoid library encompassing 39 patient-derived PDACs and identified 3 functional subtypes based on their stem cell niche factor dependencies on Wnt and R-spondin. A Wnt-non-producing subtype required Wnt from cancer-associated fibroblasts, whereas a Wnt-producing subtype autonomously secreted Wnt ligands and an R-spondin-independent subtype grew in the absence of Wnt and R-spondin. Transcriptome analysis of PDAC organoids revealed gene-expression signatures that associated Wnt niche subtypes with GATA6-dependent gene expression subtypes, which were functionally supported by genetic perturbation of GATA6. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing of PDAC driver genes (KRAS, CDKN2A, SMAD4, and TP53) demonstrated non-genetic acquisition of Wnt niche independence during pancreas tumorigenesis. Collectively, our results reveal functional heterogeneity of Wnt niche independency in PDAC that is non-genetically formed through tumor progression.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

33068050        	Oncogenic KRAS-expressing organoids with biliary epithelial stem cell properties give rise to biliary tract cancer in mice.            	Biliary tract cancer (BTC) arises from biliary epithelial cells (BECs) and includes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), gallbladder cancer (GC), and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC). Although frequent KRAS mutations and epigenetic changes at the INK4A/ARF locus have been identified, the molecular pathogenesis of BTC is unclear and the development of corresponding anticancer agents remains inadequate. We isolated epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive BECs from the mouse intrahepatic bile duct, gallbladder, and extrahepatic bile duct and established organoids derived from these cells. Introduction of activated KRAS and homozygous deletion of Ink4a/Arf in the cells of each organoid type conferred the ability to form lethal metastatic adenocarcinoma with differentiated components and a pronounced desmoplastic reaction on cell transplantation into syngeneic mice, indicating that the manipulated cells correspond to BTC-initiating cells. The syngeneic mouse models recapitulate the pathological features of human IHCC, GC, and EHCC, and they should therefore prove useful for the investigation of BTC carcinogenesis and the development of new therapeutic strategies. Tumor cells isolated from primary tumors formed organoids in three-dimensional culture, and serial syngeneic transplantation of these cells revealed that their cancer stem cell properties were supported by organoid culture, but not by adherent culture. Adherent culture thus attenuated tumorigenic activity as well as the expression of both epithelial and stem cell markers, whereas the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related transcription factor genes and mesenchymal cell markers was induced. Our data show that organoid culture is important for maintenance of epithelial cell characteristics, stemness, and tumorigenic activity of BTC-initiating cells.

30955491        	An epithelial organoid model with Langerhans cells for assessing virus-host interactions.            	Persistent infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) may lead to cancer in mucosal and skin tissue. Consequently, HPV must have developed strategies to escape host immune surveillance. Nevertheless, most HPV infections are cleared by the infected host. Our laboratory investigates Langerhans cells (LCs), acting at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity. We hypothesize that this first line of defence is vital for potential HPV elimination. As an alternative to animal models, we use smaller-scale epithelial organoids grown from human primary keratinocytes derived from various anatomical sites. This approach is amenable to large sample sizes-an essential aspect for scientific rigour and statistical power. To evaluate LCs phenotypically and molecularly during the viral life cycle and onset of carcinogenesis, we have included an engineered myeloid cell line with the ability to acquire an LC phenotype. This model is accurately tailored for the crucial time-window of early virus elimination in a complex organism and will shed more light on our long-standing research question of how naturally occurring HPV variants influence disease development. It may also be applied to other microorganism-host interaction research or enquiries of epithelium immunobiology. Finally, our continuously updated pathogen-host analysis tool enables state-of-the-art bioinformatics analyses of next-generation sequencing data.

29383499        	Applications of Bioengineered 3D Tissue and Tumor Organoids in Drug Development and Precision Medicine: Current and Future.            	Over the past decade, advances in biomedical and tissue engineering technologies, such as cell culture techniques, biomaterials, and biofabrication, have driven increasingly widespread use of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture platforms and, subsequently, the use of organoids in a variety of research endeavors. Given the 3D nature of these organoid systems, and the frequent inclusion of extracellular matrix components, these constructs typically have more physiologically accurate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions than traditional 2D cell cultures. As a result, 3D organoids can serve as better model systems than their 2D counterparts. Moreover, as organoids can be biofabricated from highly functional human cells, they have certain advantages over animal models, being human in nature and more easily manipulated in the laboratory. In this review, we describe such organoid technologies and their deployment in drug development and precision medicine efforts. Organoid technologies are rapidly being developed for these applications and now represent a wide variety of tissue types and diseases. Evidence is emerging that organoids are poised for widespread adoption, not only in academia but also in the pharmaceutical industry and in clinical diagnostic applications, positioning them as indispensable tools in medicine.	
30061712        	Improved phosphoproteomic analysis for phosphosignaling and active-kinome profiling in Matrigel-embedded spheroids and patient-derived organoids.            	Many attempts have been made to reproduce the three-dimensional (3D) cancer behavior. For that purpose, Matrigel, an extracellular matrix from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cell, is widely used in 3D cancer models such as scaffold-based spheroids and patient-derived organoids. However, severe ion suppression caused by contaminants from Matrigel hampers large-scale phosphoproteomics. In the present study, we successfully performed global phosphoproteomics from Matrigel-embedded spheroids and organoids. Using acetone precipitations of tryptic peptides, we identified more than 20,000 class 1 phosphosites from HCT116 spheroids. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that phosphoproteomic status are significantly affected by the method used for the recovery from the Matrigel, i.e., Dispase or Cell Recovery Solution. Furthermore, we observed the activation of several phosphosignalings only in spheroids and not in adherent cells which are coincident with previous study using 3D culture. Finally, we demonstrated that our protocol enabled us to identify more than 20,000 and nearly 3,000 class 1 phosphosites from 1.4 mg and 150 μg of patient-derived organoid, respectively. Additionally, we were able to quantify phosphosites with high reproducibility (r = 0.93 to 0.95). Our phosphoproteomics protocol is useful for analyzing the phosphosignalings of 3D cancer behavior and would be applied for precision medicine with patient-derived organoids.	
31683901        	Recreating Tumour Complexity in a Dish: Organoid Models to Study Liver Cancer Cells and their Extracellular Environment.            	Primary liver cancer, consisting predominantly of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide. This high malignancy is related to the complex and dynamic interactions between tumour cells, stromal cells and the extracellular environment. Novel in vitro models that can recapitulate the tumour are essential in increasing our understanding of liver cancer. Herein, primary liver cancer-derived organoids have opened up new avenues due to their patient-specificity, self-organizing ability and potential recapitulation of many of the tumour properties. Organoids are solely of epithelial origin, but incorporation into co-culture models can enable the investigation of the cellular component of the tumour microenvironment. However, the extracellular component also plays a vital role in cancer progression and representation is lacking within current in vitro models. In this review, organoid technology is discussed in the context of liver cancer models through comparisons to other cell culture systems. In addition, the role of the tumour extracellular environment in primary liver cancer will be highlighted with an emphasis on its importance in in vitro modelling. Converging novel organoid-based models with models incorporating the native tumour microenvironment could lead to experimental models that can better recapitulate liver tumours in vivo.	
31597751        	Patient-derived organoids can predict response to chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.            	There is a clear and unmet clinical need for biomarkers to predict responsiveness to chemotherapy for cancer. We developed an in vitro test based on patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) from metastatic lesions to identify nonresponders to standard-of-care chemotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). In a prospective clinical study, we show the feasibility of generating and testing PDOs for evaluation of sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our PDO test predicted response of the biopsied lesion in more than 80% of patients treated with irinotecan-based therapies without misclassifying patients who would have benefited from treatment. This correlation was specific to irinotecan-based chemotherapy, however, and the PDOs failed to predict outcome for treatment with 5-fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin. Our data suggest that PDOs could be used to prevent cancer patients from undergoing ineffective irinotecan-based chemotherapy.

30061675        	Organoid cultures recapitulate esophageal adenocarcinoma heterogeneity providing a model for clonality studies and precision therapeutics.            	Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) incidence is increasing while 5-year survival rates remain less than 15%. A lack of experimental models has hampered progress. We have generated clinically annotated EAC organoid cultures that recapitulate the morphology, genomic, and transcriptomic landscape of the primary tumor including point mutations, copy number alterations, and mutational signatures. Karyotyping of organoid cultures has confirmed polyclonality reflecting the clonal architecture of the primary tumor. Furthermore, subclones underwent clonal selection associated with driver gene status. Medium throughput drug sensitivity testing demonstrates the potential of targeting receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream mediators. EAC organoid cultures provide a pre-clinical tool for studies of clonal evolution and precision therapeutics.	
30661959        	Organoid-Induced Differentiation of Conventional T Cells from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.            	The ability to generate T cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has the potential to transform autologous T cell immunotherapy by facilitating universal, off-the-shelf cell products. However, differentiation of human PSCs into mature, conventional T cells has been challenging with existing methods. We report that a continuous 3D organoid system induced an orderly sequence of commitment and differentiation from PSC-derived embryonic mesoderm through hematopoietic specification and efficient terminal differentiation to naive CD3+CD8αβ+ and CD3+CD4+ conventional T cells with a diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Introduction of an MHC class I-restricted TCR in PSCs produced naive, antigen-specific CD8αβ+ T cells that lacked endogenous TCR expression and showed anti-tumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Functional assays and RNA sequencing aligned PSC-derived T cells with primary naive CD8+ T cells.

26501191        	Ductal pancreatic cancer modeling and drug screening using human pluripotent stem cell- and patient-derived tumor organoids.            	There are few in vitro models of exocrine pancreas development and primary human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We establish three-dimensional culture conditions to induce the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into exocrine progenitor organoids that form ductal and acinar structures in culture and in vivo. Expression of mutant KRAS or TP53 in progenitor organoids induces mutation-specific phenotypes in culture and in vivo. Expression of TP53(R175H) induces cytosolic SOX9 localization. In patient tumors bearing TP53 mutations, SOX9 was cytoplasmic and associated with mortality. We also define culture conditions for clonal generation of tumor organoids from freshly resected PDAC. Tumor organoids maintain the differentiation status, histoarchitecture and phenotypic heterogeneity of the primary tumor and retain patient-specific physiological changes, including hypoxia, oxygen consumption, epigenetic marks and differences in sensitivity to inhibition of the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Thus, pancreatic progenitor organoids and tumor organoids can be used to model PDAC and for drug screening to identify precision therapy strategies.	
32932015        	Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Provide a Stromal Niche for Liver Cancer Organoids That Confers Trophic Effects and Therapy Resistance.            	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a key role in the cancer process, but the research progress is hampered by the paucity of preclinical models that are essential for mechanistic dissection of cancer cell-CAF interactions. Here, we aimed to establish 3-dimensional (3D) organotypic co-cultures of primary liver tumor-derived organoids with CAFs, and to understand their interactions and the response to treatment.                Liver tumor organoids and CAFs were cultured from murine and human primary liver tumors. 3D co-culture models of tumor organoids with CAFs and Transwell culture systems were established in vitro. A xenograft model was used to investigate the cell-cell interactions in vivo. Gene expression analysis of CAF markers in our hepatocellular carcinoma cohort and an online liver cancer database indicated the clinical relevance of CAFs.                To functionally investigate the interactions of liver cancer cells with CAFs, we successfully established murine and human 3D co-culture models of liver tumor organoids with CAFs. CAFs promoted tumor organoid growth in co-culture with direct cell-cell contact and in a Transwell system via paracrine signaling. Vice versa, cancer cells secrete paracrine factors regulating CAF physiology. Co-transplantation of CAFs with liver tumor organoids of mouse or human origin promoted tumor growth in xenograft models. Moreover, tumor organoids conferred resistance to clinically used anticancer drugs including sorafenib, regorafenib, and 5-fluorouracil in the presence of CAFs, or the conditioned medium of CAFs.                We successfully established murine and human 3D co-culture models and have shown robust effects of CAFs in liver cancer nurturing and treatment resistance.

28634942        	3D Hanging Drop Culture to Establish Prostate Cancer Organoids.            	Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture enables the growth of cells in a multidimensional and multicellular manner compared to conventional cell culture techniques. Especially in prostate cancer research there is a big need for more tissue-recapitulating models to get a better understanding of the mechanisms driving prostate cancer as well as to screen for more efficient drugs that can be used for treatment. In this chapter we describe a 3D hanging drop system that can be used to culture prostate cancer organoids as tumor epithelial monocultures and as epithelial-stromal cocultures.	
31086460        	Organoids of liver diseases: From bench to bedside.            	Understanding the occurrence, development, and treatment of liver diseases is the main goal of hepatopathology research. Liver diseases are not only diverse but also highly heterogeneous among individuals. At present, research on liver diseases is conducted mainly through cell culture, animal models, pathological specimens, etc. However, these methods cannot fully reveal the pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic characteristics of individualized liver diseases. Recent advances in three-dimensional cell culture technology (organoid culture techniques) include pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells that are cultured in vitro to form self-organizing properties, making it possible to achieve individualized liver disease research. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the development of liver organoids, the existing and potential applications of liver regenerative medicine, the pathogenesis of liver disease heterogeneity, and drug screening.	
33647915        	Comprehensive Analysis of microRNA Profiles in Organoids Derived from Human Colorectal Adenoma and Cancer.            	Exosomes are membrane-enclosed nanovesicles, which are increasingly being recognized as important cell communication components for their role in transmitting microRNAs (miRNAs). No previous study has addressed the exosomal miRNA profile in colorectal adenomas (CRAs) because the long-term culture of CRA is challenging. This study aimed to identify the miRNA signature in organoid exosomes derived from human CRA and colorectal cancer (CRC) samples.                Organoid cultures were developed from resected colorectal tissues of patients with CRA or CRC undergoing surgery or endoscopic mucosal resection. Exosomes were prepared from the conditioned medium of the organoids. miRNAs were prepared from the exosomes and their source organoids. The miRNA expression profiles were compared using microarray analysis. The impact of alteration of miRNA expression on cell proliferation was examined using miRNA mimics or inhibitors in HT-29 human CRC cells.                We established 6 organoid lines from CRC and 8 organoid lines from CRA. Exosomal miRNA signatures were different between the organoids derived from CRA and CRC. Both exosomal and cellular miR-1246 expressions were upregulated in CRC-derived organoids compared to their expression in CRA-derived organoids. Alteration of miR-1246 expression by the miR-1246 mimic or inhibitor increased or decreased cell proliferation in HT-29 cells, respectively.                We report for the first time the miRNA profiles of exosomes in CRA- and CRC-derived organoids. The upregulation of miR-1246 might play a role in increased cell proliferation in the process of CRA-carcinoma transition.                © 2021 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.	
30038414        	Genetically engineered cerebral organoids model brain tumor formation.            	Brain tumors are among the most lethal and devastating cancers. Their study is limited by genetic heterogeneity and the incompleteness of available laboratory models. Three-dimensional organoid culture models offer innovative possibilities for the modeling of human disease. Here we establish a 3D in vitro model called a neoplastic cerebral organoid (neoCOR), in which we recapitulate brain tumorigenesis by introducing oncogenic mutations in cerebral organoids via transposon- and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis. By screening clinically relevant mutations identified in cancer genome projects, we defined mutation combinations that result in glioblastoma-like and central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (CNS-PNET)-like neoplasms. We demonstrate that neoCORs are suitable for use in investigations of aspects of tumor biology such as invasiveness, and for evaluation of drug effects in the context of specific DNA aberrations. NeoCORs will provide a valuable complement to the current basic and preclinical models used to study brain tumor biology.	
31310602        	Morphophenotypic classification of tumor organoids as an indicator of drug exposure and penetration potential.            	The dynamics of tumor progression is driven by multiple factors, which can be exogenous to the tumor (microenvironment) or intrinsic (genetic, epigenetic or due to intercellular interactions). While tumor heterogeneity has been extensively studied on the level of cell genetic profiles or cellular composition, tumor morphological diversity has not been given as much attention. The limited analysis of tumor morphophenotypes may be attributed to the lack of accurate models, both experimental and computational, capable of capturing changes in tumor morphology with fine levels of spatial detail. Using a three-dimensional, agent-based, lattice-free computational model, we generated a library of multicellular tumor organoids, the experimental analogues of in vivo tumors. By varying three biologically relevant parameters-cell radius, cell division age and cell sensitivity to contact inhibition, we showed that tumor organoids with similar growth dynamics can express distinct morphologies and possess diverse cellular compositions. Taking advantage of the high-resolution of computational modeling, we applied the quantitative measures of compactness and accessible surface area, concepts that originated from the structural biology of proteins. Based on these analyses, we demonstrated that tumor organoids with similar sizes may differ in features associated with drug effectiveness, such as potential exposure to the drug or the extent of drug penetration. Both these characteristics might lead to major differences in tumor organoid's response to therapy. This indicates that therapeutic protocols should not be based solely on tumor size, but take into account additional tumor features, such as their morphology or cellular packing density.	
32962010        	A Human Organoid Model of Aggressive Hepatoblastoma for Disease Modeling and Drug Testing.            	Hepatoblastoma is the most common childhood liver cancer. Although survival has improved significantly over the past few decades, there remains a group of children with aggressive disease who do not respond to current treatment regimens. There is a critical need for novel models to study aggressive hepatoblastoma as research to find new treatments is hampered by the small number of laboratory models of the disease. Organoids have emerged as robust models for many diseases, including cancer. We have generated and characterized a novel organoid model of aggressive hepatoblastoma directly from freshly resected patient tumors as a proof of concept for this approach. Hepatoblastoma tumor organoids recapitulate the key elements of patient tumors, including tumor architecture, mutational profile, gene expression patterns, and features of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that are hallmarks of hepatoblastoma pathophysiology. Tumor organoids were successfully used alongside non-tumor liver organoids from the same patient to perform a drug screen using twelve candidate compounds. One drug, JQ1, demonstrated increased destruction of liver organoids from hepatoblastoma tumor tissue relative to organoids from the adjacent non-tumor liver. Our findings suggest that hepatoblastoma organoids could be used for a variety of applications and have the potential to improve treatment options for the subset of hepatoblastoma patients who do not respond to existing treatments.	
33431859        	Induced organoids derived from patients with ulcerative colitis recapitulate colitic reactivity.            	The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC), a major type of inflammatory bowel disease, remains unknown. No model exists that adequately recapitulates the complexity of clinical UC. Here, we take advantage of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to develop an induced human UC-derived organoid (iHUCO) model and compared it with the induced human normal organoid model (iHNO). Notably, iHUCOs recapitulated histological and functional features of primary colitic tissues, including the absence of acidic mucus secretion and aberrant adherens junctions in the epithelial barrier both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that the CXCL8/CXCR1 axis was overexpressed in iHUCO but not in iHNO. As proof-of-principle, we show that inhibition of CXCL8 receptor by the small-molecule non-competitive inhibitor repertaxin attenuated the progression of UC phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. This patient-derived organoid model, containing both epithelial and stromal compartments, will generate new insights into the underlying pathogenesis of UC while offering opportunities to tailor interventions to the individual patient.	
33578886        	Microfluidic Organoids-on-a-Chip: Quantum Leap in Cancer Research.            	Organ-like cell clusters, so-called organoids, which exhibit self-organized and similar organ functionality as the tissue of origin, have provided a whole new level of bioinspiration for ex vivo systems. Microfluidic organoid or organs-on-a-chip platforms are a new group of micro-engineered promising models that recapitulate 3D tissue structure and physiology and combines several advantages of current in vivo and in vitro models. Microfluidics technology is used in numerous applications since it allows us to control and manipulate fluid flows with a high degree of accuracy. This system is an emerging tool for understanding disease development and progression, especially for personalized therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment, which provide well-grounded, cost-effective, powerful, fast, and reproducible results. In this review, we highlight how the organoid-on-a-chip models have improved the potential of efficiency and reproducibility of organoid cultures. More widely, we discuss current challenges and development on organoid culture systems together with microfluidic approaches and their limitations. Finally, we describe the recent progress and potential utilization in the organs-on-a-chip practice.	
31592020        	Mathematical Models of Organoid Cultures.            	Organoids are engineered three-dimensional tissue cultures derived from stem cells and capable of self-renewal and self-organization into a variety of progenitors and differentiated cell types. An organoid resembles the cellular structure of an organ and retains some of its functionality, while still being amenable to in vitro experimental study. Compared with two-dimensional cultures, the three-dimensional structure of organoids provides a more realistic environment and structural organization of in vivo organs. Similarly, organoids are better suited to reproduce signaling pathway dynamics in vitro, due to a more realistic physiological environment. As such, organoids are a valuable tool to explore the dynamics of organogenesis and offer routes to personalized preclinical trials of cancer progression, invasion, and drug response. Complementary to experiments, mathematical and computational models are valuable instruments in the description of spatiotemporal dynamics of organoids. Simulations of mathematical models allow the study of multiscale dynamics of organoids, at both the intracellular and intercellular levels. Mathematical models also enable us to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for phenotypic variation and the response to external stimulation in a cost- and time-effective manner. Many recent studies have developed laboratory protocols to grow organoids resembling different organs such as the intestine, brain, liver, pancreas, and mammary glands. However, the development of mathematical models specific to organoids remains comparatively underdeveloped. Here, we review the mathematical and computational approaches proposed so far to describe and predict organoid dynamics, reporting the simulation frameworks used and the models' strengths and limitations.

33291603        	Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids for Drug Repositioning in Cancer Care: A Promising Approach in the Era of Tailored Treatment.            	Malignancies heterogeneity represents a critical issue in cancer care, as it often causes therapy resistance and tumor relapse. Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) miniaturized representations of selected tissues within a dish. Lately, organoid technology has been applied to oncology with growing success and Patients Derived Tumor Organoids (PDTOs) constitute a novel available tool which fastens cancer research. PDTOs are in vitro models of cancer, and importantly, they can be used as a platform to validate the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. For that reason, they are currently utilized in clinics as emerging in vitro screening technology to tailor the therapy around the patient, with the final goal of beating cancer resistance and recurrence. In this sense, PDTOs biobanking is widely used and PDTO-libraries are helping the discovery of novel anticancer molecules. Moreover, they represent a good model to screen and validate compounds employed for other pathologies as off-label drugs potentially repurposed for the treatment of tumors. This will open up novel avenues of care thus ameliorating the life expectancy of cancer patients. This review discusses the present advancements in organoids research applied to oncology, with special attention to PDTOs and their translational potential, especially for anti-cancer drug testing, including off-label molecules.	
31101720        	A human organoid system that self-organizes to recapitulate growth and differentiation of a benign mammary tumor.            	As 3D culture has become central to investigation of tissue biology, mammary epithelial organoids have emerged as powerful tools for investigation of epithelial cell polarization and carcinogenesis. However, most current protocols start from single cells suspended in Matrigel, which can also restrict cell differentiation and behavior. Here, we show that the noncancerous mammary cell line HMT-3522 S1, when allowed to spontaneously form cell aggregates ("spheroids") in medium without Matrigel, switches to a collective growth mode that recapitulates many attributes of "usual ductal hyperplasia" (UDH), a common benign mammary lesion. Interestingly, these spheroids undergo a complex maturation process reminiscent of embryonic development: solid-cell cords form their own basement membrane, grow on the surface of initially homogeneous cell aggregates, and form asymmetric lumina lined by two distinct cell types that express basal and luminal cytokeratins. This sequence of events provides a cellular mechanism that explains how the characteristic crescent-shaped, asymmetrical lumina form in UDH. Our results suggest that HMT-3522 S1 spheroids are useful as an in vitro model system to study UDH biology, glandular lumen formation, and stem cell biology of the mammary gland.	
29593296        	Automated brightfield morphometry of 3D organoid populations by OrganoSeg.            	Spheroid and organoid cultures are powerful in vitro models for biology, but size and shape diversity within the culture is largely ignored. To streamline morphometric profiling, we developed OrganoSeg, an open-source software that integrates segmentation, filtering, and analysis for archived brightfield images of 3D culture. OrganoSeg is more accurate and flexible than existing platforms, and we illustrate its potential by stratifying 5167 breast-cancer spheroid and 5743 colon and colorectal-cancer organoid morphologies. Organoid transcripts grouped by morphometric signature heterogeneity were enriched for biological processes not prominent in the original RNA sequencing data. OrganoSeg enables complete, objective quantification of brightfield phenotypes, which may give insight into the molecular and multicellular mechanisms of organoid regulation.	
28644395        	Optical Tracking and Digital Quantification of Beating Behavior in Bioengineered Human Cardiac Organoids.            	Organoid and organ-on-a-chip technologies are rapidly advancing towards deployment for drug and toxicology screening applications. Liver and cardiac toxicities account for the majority of drug candidate failures in human trials. Liver toxicity generally produces liver cell death, while cardiac toxicity causes adverse changes in heart beat kinetics. In traditional 2D cultures, beating kinetics can be measured by electrode arrays, but in some 3D constructs, quantifying beating kinetics can be more challenging. For example, real time measurements of calcium flux or contractile forces are possible, yet rather complex. In this communication article, we demonstrate a simple sensing system based on software code that optically analyzes video capture files of beating cardiac organoids, translates these files in representations of moving pixels, and quantifies pixel movement activity over time to generate beat kinetic plots. We demonstrate this system using bioengineered cardiac organoids under baseline and drug conditions. This technology offers a non-invasive, low-cost, and incredibly simple method for tracking and quantifying beating behavior in cardiac organoids and organ-on-a-chip systems for drug and toxicology screening.	
28628110        	Colonic organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells for modeling colorectal cancer and drug testing.            	With the goal of modeling human disease of the large intestine, we sought to develop an effective protocol for deriving colonic organoids (COs) from differentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Extensive gene and immunohistochemical profiling confirmed that the derived COs represent colon rather than small intestine, containing stem cells, transit-amplifying cells, and the expected spectrum of differentiated cells, including goblet and endocrine cells. We applied this strategy to iPSCs derived from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP-iPSCs) harboring germline mutations in the WNT-signaling-pathway-regulator gene encoding APC, and we generated COs that exhibit enhanced WNT activity and increased epithelial cell proliferation, which we used as a platform for drug testing. Two potential compounds, XAV939 and rapamycin, decreased proliferation in FAP-COs, but also affected cell proliferation in wild-type COs, which thus limits their therapeutic application. By contrast, we found that geneticin, a ribosome-binding antibiotic with translational 'read-through' activity, efficiently targeted abnormal WNT activity and restored normal proliferation specifically in APC-mutant FAP-COs. These studies provide an efficient strategy for deriving human COs, which can be used in disease modeling and drug discovery for colorectal disease.	
31209810        	Lactate Promotes Cancer Stem-like Property of Oral Sequamous Cell Carcinoma.            	Accumulation of lactate in tumor has been linked to poor prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but the underlying mechanism remained largely uncertain. Previous studies have suggested that presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) closely correlated with cellular malignancy of OSCC. Here, using 3D organoid culture model, we investigated whether lactate promoted CSCs phenotype in primary OSCC cells. We generated organoids using fresh OSCC specimens and verified that organoids recapitulated histopathology and cellular heterogeneity of parental tumor. Organoids were then transfected with a Wnt reporter to visualize Wnt activity. The sphere forming assay demonstrated that high Wnt activity functionally designated CSCs population in OSCC cells. Further investigations indicated that lactate treatment promoted Wnt activity and increased the expression of CSCs (i.e. CD133+ cells) in organoids. Moreover, silencing monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), the prominent path for lactate uptake in human tumor with siRNA significantly impaired organoid forming capacity of OSCC cells. Together, our study demonstrated that lactate can promote CSCs phenotype of OSCC, and MCT1 may be a therapeutic target against OSCC growth.	
33037322        	Establishing a living biobank of patient-derived organoids of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas.            	Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. There is an unmet need to develop strategies to detect PaCa at an early, operable stage and prevent its progression. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic PaCa precursors that comprise nearly 50% of pancreatic cysts detected incidentally via cross-sectional imaging. Since IPMNs can progress from low- and moderate-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and invasion, the study of these lesions offers a prime opportunity to develop early detection and prevention strategies. Organoids are an ideal preclinical platform to study IPMNs, and the objective of the current investigation was to establish a living biobank of patient-derived organoids (PDO) from IPMNs. IPMN tumors and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were successfully harvested from 15 patients with IPMNs undergoing pancreatic surgical resection at Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (Tampa, FL) between May of 2017 and March of 2019. Organoid cultures were also generated from cryopreserved tissues. Organoid count and size were determined over time by both Image-Pro Premier 3D Version 9.1 digital platform and Matlab application of a Circular Hough Transform algorithm, and histologic and genomic characterization of a subset of the organoids was performed using immunohistochemistry and targeted sequencing, respectively. The success rates for organoid generation from IPMN tumor and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were 81% and 87%, respectively. IPMN organoids derived from different epithelial subtypes showed different morphologies in vitro, and organoids recapitulated histologic and genomic characteristics of the parental IPMN tumor. In summary, this preclinical model has the potential to provide new opportunities to unveil mechanisms of IPMN progression to invasion and to shed insight into novel biomarkers for early detection and targets for chemoprevention.	
30343529        	High-throughput screening in colorectal cancer tissue-originated spheroids.            	Patient-derived cancer organoid culture is an important live material that reflects clinical heterogeneity. However, the limited amount of organoids available for each case as well as the considerable amount of time and cost to expand in vitro makes it impractical to perform high-throughput drug screening using organoid cultures from multiple patients. Here, we report an advanced system for the high-throughput screening of 2427 drugs using the cancer tissue-originated spheroid (CTOS) method. In this system, we apply the CTOS method in an ex vivo platform from xenograft tumors, using machines to handle CTOS and reagents, and testing a CTOS reference panel of multiple CTOS lines for the hit drugs. CTOS passages in xenograft tumors resulted in minimal changes of morphological and genomic status, and xenograft tumor generation efficiently expanded the number of CTOS to evaluate multiple drugs. Our panel of colorectal cancer CTOS lines exhibited diverse sensitivities to the hit compounds, demonstrating the usefulness of this system for investigating highly heterogeneous disease.                © 2018 The Authors.

31105265        	CARving up colorectal cancer organoids in vitro.            		
31036964        	Ongoing chromosomal instability and karyotype evolution in human colorectal cancer organoids.            	Chromosome segregation errors cause aneuploidy and genomic heterogeneity, which are hallmarks of cancer in humans. A persistent high frequency of these errors (chromosomal instability (CIN)) is predicted to profoundly impact tumor evolution and therapy response. It is unknown, however, how prevalent CIN is in human tumors. Using three-dimensional live-cell imaging of patient-derived tumor organoids (tumor PDOs), we show that CIN is widespread in colorectal carcinomas regardless of background genetic alterations, including microsatellite instability. Cell-fate tracking showed that, although mitotic errors are frequently followed by cell death, some tumor PDOs are largely insensitive to mitotic errors. Single-cell karyotype sequencing confirmed heterogeneity of copy number alterations in tumor PDOs and showed that monoclonal lines evolved novel karyotypes over time in vitro. We conclude that ongoing CIN is common in colorectal cancer organoids, and propose that CIN levels and the tolerance for mitotic errors shape aneuploidy landscapes and karyotype heterogeneity.	
33271860        	Metabolic Drug Response Phenotyping in Colorectal Cancer Organoids by LC-QTOF-MS.            	As metabolic rewiring is crucial for cancer cell proliferation, metabolic phenotyping of patient-derived organoids is desirable to identify drug-induced changes and trace metabolic vulnerabilities of tumor subtypes. We established a novel protocol for metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of colorectal cancer organoids by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) facing the challenge of capturing metabolic information from a minimal sample amount (<500 cells/injection) in the presence of an extracellular matrix (ECM). The best procedure of the tested protocols included ultrasonic metabolite extraction with acetonitrile/methanol/water (2:2:1, v/v/v) without ECM removal. To eliminate ECM-derived background signals, we implemented a data filtering procedure based on the p-value and fold change cut-offs, which retained features with signal intensities >120% compared to matrix-derived signals present in blank samples. As a proof-of-concept, the method was applied to examine the early metabolic response of colorectal cancer organoids to 5-fluorouracil treatment. Statistical analysis revealed dose-dependent changes in the metabolic profiles of treated organoids including elevated levels of 2'-deoxyuridine, 2'-O-methylcytidine, inosine and 1-methyladenosine and depletion of 2'-deoxyadenosine and specific phospholipids. In accordance with the mechanism of action of 5-fluorouracil, changed metabolites are mainly involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. The novel protocol provides a first basis for the assessment of metabolic drug response phenotypes in 3D organoid models.	
27539461        	Study Bacteria-Host Interactions Using Intestinal Organoids.            	The intestinal epithelial cells function to gain nutrients, retain water and electrolytes, and form an efficient barrier against foreign microbes and antigens. Researchers employed cell culture lines derived from human or animal cancer cells as experimental models in vitro for understanding of intestinal infections. However, most in vitro models used to investigate interactions between bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells fail to recreate the differentiated tissue components and structure observed in the normal intestine. The in vitro analysis of host-bacteria interactions in the intestine has been hampered by a lack of suitable intestinal epithelium culture systems. Here, we present a new experimental model using an organoid culture system to study bacterial infection.	
31191661        	CFTR Expression Analysis for Subtyping of Human Pancreatic Cancer Organoids.            	Organoid cultures of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have become a promising tool for tumor subtyping and individualized chemosensitivity testing. PDACs have recently been grouped into different molecular subtypes with clinical impact based on cytokeratin-81 (KRT81) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A). However, a suitable antibody for HNF1A is currently unavailable. The present study is aimed at establishing subtyping in PDAC organoids using an alternative marker.                A PDAC organoid biobank was generated from human primary tumor samples containing 22 lines. Immunofluorescence staining was established and done for 10 organoid lines for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and KRT81. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed for CFTR and HNF1A. A chemotherapeutic drug response analysis was done using gemcitabine, 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.                A biobank of patient-derived PDAC organoids was established. The efficiency was 71% (22/31) with 68% for surgical resections and 83% for fine needle aspirations. Organoids could be categorized into the established quasimesenchymal, exocrine-like, and classical subtypes based on KRT81 and CFTR immunoreactivity. CFTR protein expression was confirmed on the transcript level. CFTR and HNF1A transcript expression levels positively correlated (n = 10; r = 0.927; p = 0.001). PDAC subtypes of the primary tumors and the corresponding organoid lines were identical for most of the cases analyzed (6/7). Treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs revealed tendencies but no significant differences regarding drug responses.                Human PDAC organoids can be classified into known subtypes based on KRT81 and CFTR immunoreactivity. CFTR and HNF1A mRNA levels correlated well. Furthermore, subtype-specific immunoreactivity matched well between PDAC organoids and the respective primary tumor tissue. Subtyping of human PDACs using CFTR might constitute an alternative to HNF1A and should be further investigated.	
32198276        	Use of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and Kidney Organoids To Develop a Cysteamine/mTOR Inhibition Combination Therapy for Cystinosis.            	Mutations in CTNS-a gene encoding the cystine transporter cystinosin-cause the rare, autosomal, recessive, lysosomal-storage disease cystinosis. Research has also implicated cystinosin in modulating the mTORC1 pathway, which serves as a core regulator of cellular metabolism, proliferation, survival, and autophagy. In its severest form, cystinosis is characterized by cystine accumulation, renal proximal tubule dysfunction, and kidney failure. Because treatment with the cystine-depleting drug cysteamine only slows disease progression, there is an urgent need for better treatments.                To address a lack of good human-based cell culture models for studying cystinosis, we generated the first human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and kidney organoid models of the disorder. We used a variety of techniques to examine hallmarks of cystinosis-including cystine accumulation, lysosome size, the autophagy pathway, and apoptosis-and performed RNA sequencing on isogenic lines to identify differentially expressed genes in the cystinosis models compared with controls.                Compared with controls, these cystinosis models exhibit elevated cystine levels, increased apoptosis, and defective basal autophagy. Cysteamine treatment ameliorates this phenotype, except for abnormalities in apoptosis and basal autophagy. We found that treatment with everolimus, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, reduces the number of large lysosomes, decreases apoptosis, and activates autophagy, but it does not rescue the defect in cystine loading. However, dual treatment of cystinotic iPSCs or kidney organoids with cysteamine and everolimus corrects all of the observed phenotypic abnormalities.                These observations suggest that combination therapy with a cystine-depleting drug such as cysteamine and an mTOR pathway inhibitor such as everolimus has potential to improve treatment of cystinosis.

31761724        	Patient-Derived Organoids Predict Chemoradiation Responses of Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.            	Accumulating evidence indicates that patient-derived organoids (PDOs) can predict drug responses in the clinic, but the ability of PDOs to predict responses to chemoradiation in cancer patients remains an open question. Here we generate a living organoid biobank from patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACR) enrolled in a phase III clinical trial. Our co-clinical trial data confirm that rectal cancer organoids (RCOs) closely recapitulate the pathophysiology and genetic changes of corresponding tumors. Chemoradiation responses in patients are highly matched to RCO responses, with 84.43% accuracy, 78.01% sensitivity, and 91.97% specificity. These data imply that PDOs predict LARC patient responses in the clinic and may represent a companion diagnostic tool in rectal cancer treatment.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

31992334        	Hedgehog signaling promotes sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma patient-derived organoids.            	The mechanism underlying sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests that tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are a pivotal driving force. Both CD44 and Hedgehog signaling play crucial roles in TIC properties in HCC. In this study, we explored the roles of CD44 and Hedgehog signaling in sorafenib resistance and evaluated the therapeutic effect of cotreatment with sorafenib and Hedgehog signaling inhibitors in HCC patient-derived organoid (PDO) models to improve treatment efficacy.                We collected HCC specimens to establish PDO models. Cell viability and malignant transformation properties were investigated after treatment with different TIC-related inhibitors alone or in combination with sorafenib to evaluate the therapeutic effect in PDOs and cell lines by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Expression levels of Hedgehog signaling proteins and CD44 were monitored to reveal potential relationships.                We demonstrated that our HCC PDO models strongly maintained the histological features of the corresponding tumors and responded to drug treatment. Furthermore, CD44-positive HCC PDOs were obviously resistant to sorafenib, and sorafenib increased CD44 levels. A drug screen showed that compared with Notch, Hippo and Wnt signaling inhibitors, a Hedgehog signaling inhibitor (GANT61) potently suppressed HCC PDO cell viability. In addition, there was a highly synergistic effect in vitro and in vivo on the suppression of cell viability and malignant properties when sorafenib and GANT61 were added to CD44-positive HCC PDOs and cell lines, respectively. Furthermore, the upregulation of CD44 and Hedgehog signaling induced by sorafenib was reversed by GANT61.                GANT61 significantly suppressed Hedgehog signaling to reverse sorafenib resistance in CD44-positive HCC. The combination of sorafenib and Hedgehog signaling inhibitors might be effective in HCC patients with high CD44 levels as a personalized-medicine approach.	
32150173        	Universal and Efficient Electroporation Protocol for Genetic Engineering of Gastrointestinal Organoids.            	Electroporation is a common method for transfection with different kinds of molecules by electrical permeabilization of the plasma membrane. With the increasing use of organoids as a culturing method for primary patient material in the last years, efficient transfer methods of components for genetic engineering in this 3D culture system are in need. Especially for organoids, the efficiency of genetic manipulations depends on a successful transfection. Thus, this protocol was developed to facilitate the electroporation of organoids and to prove its universal functionality in different entities. Human colorectal, pancreatic, hepatic and gastric cancer organoids were successfully electroporated with small and large plasmids in comparison. Based on GFP encoding vectors, the transfection efficiency was determined by FACS. No extensive preparation of the cells or special, cost-intensive electroporation buffers are necessary, and the protocol can be performed within one day.	
29983891        	Cancer-predicting transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures revealed for ulcerative colitis in patient-derived epithelial organoids.            	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a prevalent form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) whose pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. Elucidating these mechanisms is important to reduce UC symptoms and to prevent UC progression into colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). Our goal was to develop and validate faithful, human-derived, UC models and analyze them at histologic, transcriptomic and epigenetic levels to allow mechanistic studies of UC and CAC pathogenesis. We generated patient-derived primary-organoid cultures from UC and non-IBD colonic epithelium. We phenotyped them histologically and used next-generation-sequencing approaches to profile whole transcriptomes and epigenomes of organoids and primary tissues. Tissue organization and expression of mucin 2 (MUC2) and lysozyme (LYZ) demonstrated histologic faithfulness of organoids to healthy and diseased colonic epithelium. Transcriptomic analyses showed increased expression of inflammatory pathways in UC patient-derived organoids and tissues. Profiling for active enhancers using the H3K27ac histone modification revealed UC-derived organoid enrichment for pathways indicative of gastrointestinal cancer, including S100 calcium-binding protein P (S100P), and revealed novel markers for GI cancer, including both LYZ and neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1). Immunolocalization showed increased levels of LYZ, S100P, and NPSR1 proteins in UC and CAC. In conclusion, primary colonic organoid cultures from UC and non-IBD patients can be established that faithfully represent diseased or normal colonic states. These models reveal precancerous molecular pathways that are already activated in UC. The findings demonstrate the suitability of primary organoids for dissecting UC and CAC pathogenic mechanisms and suggest new targets for therapeutic intervention.	
29263081        	Opportunities for organoids as new models of aging.            	The biology of aging is challenging to study, particularly in humans. As a result, model organisms are used to approximate the physiological context of aging in humans. However, the best model organisms remain expensive and time-consuming to use. More importantly, they may not reflect directly on the process of aging in people. Human cell culture provides an alternative, but many functional signs of aging occur at the level of tissues rather than cells and are therefore not readily apparent in traditional cell culture models. Organoids have the potential to effectively balance between the strengths and weaknesses of traditional models of aging. They have sufficient complexity to capture relevant signs of aging at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels, while presenting an experimentally tractable alternative to animal studies. Organoid systems have been developed to model many human tissues and diseases. Here we provide a perspective on the potential for organoids to serve as models for aging and describe how current organoid techniques could be applied to aging research.                © 2018 Hu et al.	
30674722        	Human primary liver cancer organoids reveal intratumor and interpatient drug response heterogeneity.            	Liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality and is distinguished by a relative paucity of chemotherapy options. It has been hypothesized that intratumor genetic heterogeneity may contribute to the high failure rate of chemotherapy. Here, we evaluated functional heterogeneity in a cohort of primary human liver cancer organoid lines. Each primary human liver cancer surgical specimen was used to generate multiple cancer organoid lines, obtained from distinct regions of the tumor. A total of 27 liver cancer lines were established and tested with 129 cancer drugs, generating 3,483 cell survival data points. We found a rich intratumor, functional (drug response) heterogeneity in our liver cancer patients. Furthermore, we established that the majority of drugs were either ineffective, or effective only in select organoid lines. In contrast, we found that a subset of drugs appeared pan-effective, displaying at least moderate activity in the majority of these cancer organoid lines. These drugs, which are FDA approved for indications other than liver cancers, deserve further consideration as either systemic or local therapeutics. Of note, molecular profiles, obtained for a reduced sample set, did not correlate with the drug response heterogeneity of liver cancer organoid lines. Taken together, these findings lay the foundation for in-depth studies of pan-effective drugs, as well as for functional personalized oncology approaches. Lastly, these functional studies demonstrate the utility of cancer organoid drug testing as part of a drug discovery pipeline.	
29959712        	Mouse-Derived Gastric Organoid and Immune Cell Co-culture for the Study of the Tumor Microenvironment.            	The interaction between the receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and ligand, programmed cell death 1 (PD-L1) is known to inhibit CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte proliferation, survival, and effector function. The result of this interaction leads to evasion of immune surveillance by tumors and subsequently cancer cell proliferation. Immunotherapy via PD-L1 blockade is used for a variety of malignancies, yet the prognostic value of immune checkpoint inhibition for the treatment of gastric cancer remains controversial. Thus, preclinical models that would predict the efficacy of such therapy in a subgroup of gastric cancer patients would be an advancement in the personalized treatment of this disease. Three-dimensional organoid cultures have not only been used to investigate the mechanisms regulating development and disease, but have also been used for high-throughput drug screening for targeted personalized therapy. Here we present the methodology for the co-culture of mouse-derived gastric cancer organoids with autologous immune cells specifically for the study of PD-L1/PD-1 interactions within the tumor microenvironment in vitro.	
28756233        	Organoid culture systems to study host-pathogen interactions.            	Recent advances in host-microbe interaction studies in organoid cultures have shown great promise and have laid the foundation for much more refined future studies using these systems. Modeling of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in cerebral organoids have helped us understand its association with microcephaly. Similarly, the pathogenesis of bacterial (Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile) and viral (Norovirus, Rotaviruses) infections have been precisely dissected in organoid cultures. Additionally, direct associations between microbial colonization of tissues and diseases like cancer have also been deciphered. Here we discuss the most recent and striking studies on host-microbe interactions in organoid cultures, highlighting various methods which can be used for developing microbe-organoid co-culture systems.

26907527        	Organoids as Models for Neoplastic Transformation.            	Cancer models strive to recapitulate the incredible diversity inherent in human tumors. A key challenge in accurate tumor modeling lies in capturing the panoply of homo- and heterotypic cellular interactions within the context of a three-dimensional tissue microenvironment. To address this challenge, researchers have developed organotypic cancer models (organoids) that combine the 3D architecture of in vivo tissues with the experimental facility of 2D cell lines. Here we address the benefits and drawbacks of these systems, as well as their most recent advances. In particular, we focus on the application of such models to the discovery of novel cancer drivers, the study of tumor biology, and the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer.	
32938988        	Modeling HIV-1 neuropathogenesis using three-dimensional human brain organoids (hBORGs) with HIV-1 infected microglia.            	HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is characterized by neuroinflammation and glial activation that, together with the release of viral proteins, trigger a pathogenic cascade resulting in synaptodendritic damage and neurodegeneration that lead to cognitive impairment. However, the molecular events underlying HIV neuropathogenesis remain elusive, mainly due to lack of brain-representative experimental systems to study HIV-CNS pathology. To fill this gap, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) human brain organoid (hBORG) model containing major cell types important for HIV-1 neuropathogenesis; neurons and astrocytes along with incorporation of HIV-infected microglia. Both infected and uninfected microglia infiltrated into hBORGs resulting in a triculture system (MG-hBORG) that mirrors the multicellular network observed in HIV-infected human brain. Moreover, the MG-hBORG model supported productive viral infection and exhibited increased inflammatory response by HIV-infected MG-hBORGs, releasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1β) and thereby mimicking the chronic neuroinflammatory environment observed in HIV-infected individuals. This model offers great promise for basic understanding of how HIV-1 infection alters the CNS compartment and induces pathological changes, paving the way for discovery of biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.	
32633046        	Genomic characteristics and drug screening among organoids derived from non-small cell lung cancer patients.            	Patient-derived organoid (PDO) models are highly valuable and have potentially widespread clinical applications. However, limited information is available regarding organoid models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to characterize the consistency between primary tumors in NSCLC and PDOs and to explore the applications of PDOs as preclinical models to understand and predict treatment response during lung cancer.                Fresh tumor samples were harvested for organoid culture. Primary tumor samples and PDOs were analyzed via whole-exome sequencing. Paired samples were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. There were 26 antineoplastic drugs tested in the PDOs. Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Titer Glo assay 7-10 days after drug treatment. A heatmap of log-transformed values of the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations was generated on the basis of drug responses of PDOs through nonlinear regression (curve fit). A total of 12 patients (stages I-III) were enrolled, and 7 paired surgical tumors and PDOs were analyzed.                PDOs retained the histological and genetic characteristics of the primary tumors. The concordance between tumors and PDOs in mutations in the top 20 NSCLC-related genes was >80% in five patients. Sample purity was significantly and positively associated with variant allele frequency (Pearson r = 0.82, P = 0.0005) and chromosome stability. The in vitro response to drug screening with PDOs revealed high correlation with the mutation profiles in the primary tumors.                PDOs are highly credible models for detecting NSCLC and for prospective prediction of the treatment response for personalized precision medicine.                Lung cancer organoid models could save precious time of drug testing on patients, and accurately select anticancer drugs according to the drug sensitivity results, so as to provide a powerful supplement and verification for the gene sequencing.                © 2020 The Authors.

33160014        	Organoid model: A new hope for pancreatic cancer treatment?            	Pancreatic cancer is a rapidly progressing disease with a poor prognosis. We still have many questions about the pathogenesis, early diagnosis and precise treatment of this disease. Organoids, a rapidly emerging technology, can simulate the characteristics of pancreatic tumors. Using the organoid model of pancreatic cancer, we can study and explore the characteristics of pancreatic cancer, thereby effectively guiding clinical practice and improving patient prognosis. This review introduces the development of organoids, comparisons of organoids with other preclinical models and the status of organoids in basic research and clinical applications for pancreatic cancer.

29957217        	Live imaging of cell division in 3D stem-cell organoid cultures.            	Examining cell behavior in its correct tissue context is a major challenge in cell biology. The recent development of mammalian stem cell-based organoid cultures offers exciting opportunities to visualize dynamic cellular events in a 3D tissue-like setting. We describe here an approach for live imaging of cell division processes in intestinal organoid cultures derived from human and mouse adult stem cells. These approaches can be extended to the analysis of cellular events in diseased tissue, such as patient-derived tumor organoids.                © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
32206037        	Breast cancer organoids from a patient with giant papillary carcinoma as a high-fidelity model.            	Papillary carcinoma is an uncommon type of breast cancer. Additionally, patients with huge breast papillary carcinoma are extremely rare in clinical practice. To improve therapeutic effect on such patients, it is urgent to explore biologically and clinically relevant models of the disease to discover effective drugs.                We collected surgical tumor specimens from a 63-year-old Chinese woman who has been diagnosed breast papillary carcinoma. The tumor was more than 15 cm in diameter, and applied to establish patient-derived papillary carcinoma organoids that could continuously propagate for more than 6 months.                The papillary carcinoma organoids matched the histological characteristics of orginal tumor by H&E staining identification, and maintained the expression of the breast cancer biomarkers by IHC, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) and antigen Ki-67 (Ki67). In addition, we performed a 3-D drug screening to examine the effects of endocrine drugs (Fulvestrant, Tamoxifen) and targeted therapy drugs (Palbociclib, Everolimus, BKM120) on breast papillary carcinoma in the mimic in vivo environment. The drug sensitivities of our breast papillary carcinoma organoids were investigated as follows, Fulvestrant (IC50 0.275 μmol), Palbociclib (IC50 2.21 μmol), BKM120 (IC50 3.81 μmol), Everolimus (IC50 4.45 μmol), Tamoxifen (IC50 19.13 μmol).                These results showed that an effective organoid platform for 3-D in vitro culture of breast cancer organoids from patients with breast papillary carcinoma could be used to identify possible treatments, and might be commonly applied to explore clinicopathological characteristics of breast papillary carcinoma.                © The Author(s) 2020.

32213029        	Pancreatic cancer-derived organoids - a disease modeling tool to predict drug response.            	Organotypic cultures derived from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) termed pancreatic ductal cancer organoids (PDOs) recapitulate the primary cancer and can be derived from primary or metastatic biopsies. Although isolation and culture of patient-derived pancreatic organoids were established several years ago, pros and cons for individualized medicine have not been comprehensively investigated to date.                We conducted a feasibility study, systematically comparing head-to-head patient-derived xenograft tumor (PDX) and PDX-derived organoids by rigorous immunohistochemical and molecular characterization. Subsequently, a drug testing platform was set up and validated in vivo. Patient-derived organoids were investigated as well.                First, PDOs faithfully recapitulated the morphology and marker protein expression patterns of the PDXs. Second, quantitative proteomes from the PDX as well as from corresponding organoid cultures showed high concordance. Third, genomic alterations, as assessed by array-based comparative genomic hybridization, revealed similar results in both groups. Fourth, we established a small-scale pharmacotyping platform adjusted to operate in parallel considering potential obstacles such as culture conditions, timing, drug dosing, and interpretation of the results. In vitro predictions were successfully validated in an in vivo xenograft trial. Translational proof-of-concept is exemplified in a patient with PDAC receiving palliative chemotherapy.                Small-scale drug screening in organoids appears to be a feasible, robust and easy-to-handle disease modeling method to allow response predictions in parallel to daily clinical routine. Therefore, our fast and cost-efficient assay is a reasonable approach in a predictive clinical setting.	
29415026        	Organoids with cancer stem cell-like properties secrete exosomes and HSP90 in a 3D nanoenvironment.            	Ability to form cellular aggregations such as tumorspheres and spheroids have been used as a morphological marker of malignant cancer cells and in particular cancer stem cells (CSC). However, the common definition of the types of cellular aggregation formed by cancer cells has not been available. We examined morphologies of 67 cell lines cultured on three dimensional morphology enhancing NanoCulture Plates (NCP) and classified the types of cellular aggregates that form. Among the 67 cell lines, 49 cell lines formed spheres or spheroids, 8 cell lines formed grape-like aggregation (GLA), 8 cell lines formed other types of aggregation, and 3 cell lines formed monolayer sheets. Seven GLA-forming cell lines were derived from adenocarcinoma among the 8 lines. A neuroendocrine adenocarcinoma cell line PC-3 formed asymmetric GLA with ductal structures on the NCPs and rapidly growing asymmetric tumors that metastasized to lymph nodes in immunocompromised mice. In contrast, another adenocarcinoma cell line DU-145 formed spheroids in vitro and spheroid-like tumors in vivo that did not metastasize to lymph nodes until day 50 after transplantation. Culture in the 3D nanoenvironment and in a defined stem cell medium enabled the neuroendocrine adenocarcinoma cells to form slowly growing large organoids that expressed multiple stem cell markers, neuroendocrine markers, intercellular adhesion molecules, and oncogenes in vitro. In contrast, the more commonly used 2D serum-contained environment reduced intercellular adhesion and induced mesenchymal transition and promoted rapid growth of the cells. In addition, the 3D stemness nanoenvironment promoted secretion of HSP90 and EpCAM-exosomes, a marker of CSC phenotype, from the neuroendocrine organoids. These findings indicate that the NCP-based 3D environment enables cells to form stem cell tumoroids with multipotency and model more accurately the in vivo tumor status at the levels of morphology and gene expression.	
31078067        	Cellular Metabolic Heterogeneity In Vivo Is Recapitulated in Tumor Organoids.            	Heterogeneous populations within a tumor have varying metabolic profiles, which can muddle the interpretation of bulk tumor imaging studies of treatment response. Although methods to study tumor metabolism at the cellular level are emerging, these methods provide a single time point "snapshot" of tumor metabolism and require a significant time and animal burden while failing to capture the longitudinal metabolic response of a single tumor to treatment. Here, we investigated a novel method for longitudinal, single-cell tracking of metabolism across heterogeneous tumor cell populations using optical metabolic imaging (OMI), which measures autofluorescence of metabolic coenzymes as a report of metabolic activity. We also investigated whether in vivo cellular metabolic heterogeneity can be accurately captured using tumor-derived three-dimensional organoids in a genetically engineered mouse model of breast cancer. OMI measurements of response to paclitaxel and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor XL147 in tumors and organoids taken at single cell resolution revealed parallel shifts in metaboltruic heterogeneity. Interestingly, these previously unappreciated heterogeneous metabolic responses in tumors and organoids could not be attributed to tumor cell fate or varying leukocyte content within the microenvironment, suggesting that heightened metabolic heterogeneity upon treatment is largely due to heterogeneous metabolic shifts within tumor cells. Together, these studies show that OMI revealed remarkable heterogeneity in response to treatment, which could provide a novel approach to predict the presence of potentially unresponsive tumor cell subpopulations lurking within a largely responsive bulk tumor population, which might otherwise be overlooked by traditional measurements.

31097753        	A 3D bioprinter platform for mechanistic analysis of tumoroids and chimeric mammary organoids.            	The normal mammary microenvironment can suppress tumorigenesis and redirect cancer cells to adopt a normal mammary epithelial cell fate in vivo. Understanding of this phenomenon offers great promise for novel treatment and detection strategies in cancer, but current model systems make mechanistic insights into the process difficult. We have recently described a low-cost bioprinting platform designed to be accessible for basic cell biology laboratories. Here we report the use of this system for the study of tumorigenesis and microenvironmental redirection of breast cancer cells. We show our bioprinter significantly increases tumoroid formation in 3D collagen gels and allows for precise generation of tumoroid arrays. We also demonstrate that we can mimic published in vivo findings by co-printing cancer cells along with normal mammary epithelial cells to generate chimeric organoids. These chimeric organoids contain cancer cells that take part in normal luminal formation. Furthermore, we show for the first time that cancer cells within chimeric structures have a significant increase in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels as compared to bioprinted tumoroids. These results demonstrate the capacity of our 3D bioprinting platform to study tumorigenesis and microenvironmental control of breast cancer and highlight a novel mechanistic insight into the process of microenvironmental control of cancer.	
33633154        	A bladder cancer patient-derived xenograft displays aggressive growth dynamics in vivo and in organoid culture.            	Bladder cancer is among the most prevalent cancers worldwide. Currently, few bladder cancer models have undergone thorough characterization to assess their fidelity to patient tumors, especially upon propagation in the laboratory. Here, we establish and molecularly characterize CoCaB 1, an aggressive cisplatin-resistant muscle-invasive bladder cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and companion organoid system. CoCaB 1 was a subcutaneous PDX model reliably transplanted in vivo and demonstrated an acceleration in growth upon serial transplantation, which was reflected in organoid and 2D cell culture systems. Transcriptome analysis revealed progression towards an increasingly proliferative and stem-like expression profile. Gene expression differences between organoid and PDX models reflected expected differences in cellular composition, with organoids enriched in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism genes and deprived of extracellular components observed in PDXs. Both PDX and organoid models maintained the histological fidelity and mutational heterogeneity of their parental tumor. This study establishes the CoCaB 1 PDX and organoid system as companion representative tumor models for the development of novel bladder cancer therapies.	
32632882        	Personalized Identification of Optimal HIPEC Perfusion Protocol in Patient-Derived Tumor Organoid Platform.            	Chemotherapy dosing duration and perfusion temperature vary significantly in HIPEC protocols. This study investigates patient-derived tumor organoids as a platform to identify the most efficacious perfusion protocol in a personalized approach.                Peritoneal tumor tissue from 15 appendiceal and 8 colon cancer patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC were used for personalized organoid development. Organoids were perfused in parallel at 37 and 42 °C with low- and high-dose oxaliplatin (200 mg/m2 over 2 h vs. 460 mg/m2 over 30 min) and MMC (40 mg/3L over 2 h). Viability assays were performed and pooled for statistical analysis.                An adequate organoid number was generated for 75% (6/8) of colon and 73% (11/15) of appendiceal patients. All 42 °C treatments displayed lower viability than 37 °C treatments. On pooled analysis, MMC and 200 mg/m2 oxaliplatin displayed no treatment difference for either appendiceal or colon organoids (19% vs. 25%, p = 0.22 and 27% vs. 31%, p = 0.55, respectively), whereas heated MMC was superior to 460 mg/m2 oxaliplatin in both primaries (19% vs. 54%, p < 0.001 and 27% vs. 53%, p = 0.002, respectively). In both appendiceal and colon tumor organoids, heated 200 mg/m2 oxaliplatin displayed increased cytotoxicity as compared with 460 mg/m2 oxaliplatin (25% vs. 54%, p < 0.001 and 31% vs. 53%, p = 0.008, respectively).                Organoids treated with MMC or 200 mg/m2 heated oxaliplatin for 2 h displayed increased susceptibility in comparison with 30-min 460 mg/m2 oxaliplatin. Optimal perfusion protocol varies among patients, and organoid technology may offer a platform for tailoring HIPEC conditions to the individual patient level.	
29807351        	Cortical organoids: why all this hype?            	The development of organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells heralded a new area in studying human organ development and pathology outside of the human body. Triggered by the seminal work of pioneers in the field such as Yoshiki Sasai or Hans Clevers, organoid research has become one of the most rapidly developing fields in cell biology. The potential applications are manifold reaching from developmental studies to tissue regeneration and drug screening. In this review, we will concentrate on brain organoids of cortical identity. We will describe the 'state of the art' in generating cortical organoids and discuss potential applications. Finally, we will provide future perspectives including suggestions how further innovations can broaden the application of brain organoids.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

33638203        	Hepatobiliary organoids and their applications for studies of liver health and disease: are we there yet?            	Organoid culture systems have emerged as a frontier technology in liver and biliary research. These 3-dimensional (3D) cell cultures derived from pluripotent and adult hepatobiliary cells model organ structure and function. Building on gastrointestinal organoid establishment, the first hepatobiliary organoid cultures were generated from mouse LGR5+ liver progenitor cells. Subsequently, 3D hepatobiliary organoid cultures were developed from hepatocytes and cholangiocytes to model human and animal hepatobiliary health and disease. Hepatocyte organoids have been used to study Alagille syndrome, fatty liver disease, Wilson's disease, hepatitis B viral infection, and cystic fibrosis. Cholangiocyte organoids have been established to study normal cholangiocyte biology and primary sclerosing cholangitis, and to test organoid potential to form bile ducts and gallbladder in vitro. Hepatobiliary cancer organoids, termed tumoroids, have been established from frozen and fresh human tissues and used as a drug-testing platform and for biobanking of cancer samples. CRISPR-based gene modifications and organoid exposure to infectious agents have permitted the generation of organoid models of carcinogenesis. This review summarizes currently available adult cell-derived hepatobiliary organoid models and their applications. Challenges faced by this young technology will be discussed, including cellular immaturity of organoid-derived hepatocytes, co-culture development to better model complex tissue structure, imperfection of extracellular matrices, and absence of standardized protocols and model validation.

32824266        	Comparative Study of Organoids from Patient-Derived Normal and Tumor Colon and Rectal Tissue.            	Colon and rectal tumors, often referred to as colorectal cancer, show different gene expression patterns in studies that analyze whole tissue biopsies containing a mix of tumor and non-tumor cells. To better characterize colon and rectal tumors, we investigated the gene expression profile of organoids generated from endoscopic biopsies of rectal tumors and adjacent normal colon and rectum mucosa from therapy-naive rectal cancer patients. We also studied the effect of vitamin D on these organoid types. Gene profiling was performed by RNA-sequencing. Organoids from a normal colon and rectum had a shared gene expression profile that profoundly differed from that of rectal tumor organoids. We identified a group of genes of the biosynthetic machinery as rectal tumor organoid-specific, including those encoding the RNA polymerase II subunits POLR2H and POLR2J. The active vitamin D metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3/calcitriol upregulated stemness-related genes (LGR5, LRIG1, SMOC2, and MSI1) in normal rectum organoids, while it downregulated differentiation marker genes (TFF2 and MUC2). Normal colon and rectum organoids share similar gene expression patterns and respond similarly to calcitriol. Rectal tumor organoids display distinct and heterogeneous gene expression profiles, with differences with respect to those of colon tumor organoids, and respond differently to calcitriol than normal rectum organoids.	
25241035        	Single luminal epithelial progenitors can generate prostate organoids in culture.            	The intrinsic ability to exhibit self-organizing morphogenetic properties in ex vivo culture may represent a general property of tissue stem cells. Here we show that single luminal stem/progenitor cells can generate prostate organoids in a three-dimensional culture system in the absence of stroma. Organoids generated from CARNs (castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells) or normal prostate epithelia exhibit tissue architecture containing luminal and basal cells, undergo long-term expansion in culture and exhibit functional androgen receptor signalling. Lineage-tracing demonstrates that luminal cells are favoured for organoid formation and generate basal cells in culture. Furthermore, tumour organoids can initiate from CARNs after oncogenic transformation and from mouse models of prostate cancer, and can facilitate analyses of drug response. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the feasibility of organoid studies of human prostate tissue. Our studies underscore the progenitor properties of luminal cells, and identify in vitro approaches for studying prostate biology.

31107464        	Growth and Characterization of Irradiated Organoids from Mammary Glands.            	Organoids derived from the digested tissue are multicellular three-dimensional (3D) constructs that better recapitulate in vivo conditions than cell monolayers. Although they cannot completely model in vivo complexity, they retain some functionality of the original organ. In cancer models, organoids are commonly used to study tumor cell invasion. This protocol aims to develop and characterize organoids from the normal and irradiated mouse mammary gland tissue to evaluate the radiation response in normal tissues. These organoids can be applied to future in vitro cancer studies to evaluate tumor cell interactions with irradiated organoids. Mammary glands were resected, irradiated to 20 Gy and digested in a collagenase VIII solution. Epithelial organoids were separated via centrifugal differentiation, and 3D organoids were developed in 96-well low-adhesion microplates. Organoids expressed the characteristic epithelial marker cytokeratin 14. Macrophage interaction with the organoids was observed in co-culture experiments. This model may be useful for studying tumor-stromal interactions, infiltration of immune cells, and macrophage polarization within an irradiated microenvironment.	
29551162        	Organoids for Modeling Genetic Diseases.            	In less than a decade, organoid systems have emerged as an innovative and valid in vitro method to mimic in vivo pathophysiology. Organoids are 3D structures constituted by multiple organ-specific cell types that self-organize and can function as miniature organs. Organoids have quickly become an important tool for basic and translational research with wide applications for disease modeling, drug screening, drug optimization, and personalized and regenerative medicine. In this review, we summarize the recent utilization of organoids for modeling human genetic diseases, a research area with promising biomedical applications.                © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

32283573        	Progress in the application of organoids to breast cancer research.            	Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women. Breast cancer research is currently based mainly on animal models and traditional cell culture. However, the inherent species gap between humans and animals, as well as differences in organization between organs and cells, limits research advances. The breast cancer organoid can reproduce many of the key features of human breast cancer, thereby providing a new platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying the development, progression, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer. The application of organoid technology can also promote drug discovery and the design of individualized treatment strategies. Here, we discuss the latest advances in the use of organoid technology for breast cancer research.                © 2020 The Authors.

32180555        	ISX-9 manipulates endocrine progenitor fate revealing conserved intestinal lineages in mouse and human organoids.            	Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) survey the gut luminal environment and coordinate hormonal, immune and neuronal responses to it. They exhibit well-characterised physiological roles ranging from the control of local gut function to whole body metabolism, but little is known regarding the regulatory networks controlling their differentiation, especially in the human gut. The small molecule isoxazole-9 (ISX-9) has been shown to stimulate neuronal and pancreatic beta-cell differentiation, both closely related to EEC differentiation. Our aim was to use ISX-9 as a tool to explore EEC differentiation.                We investigated the effects of ISX-9 on EEC differentiation in mouse and human intestinal organoids, using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), fluorescent-activated cell sorting, immunostaining and single-cell RNA sequencing.                ISX-9 increased the number of neurogenin3-RFP (Ngn3)-positive endocrine progenitor cells and upregulated NeuroD1 and Pax4, transcription factors that play roles in mouse EEC specification. Single-cell analysis showed induction of Pax4 expression in a developmentally late Ngn3+ population of cells and potentiation of genes associated with progenitors biased toward serotonin-producing enterochromaffin (EC) cells. Further, we observed enrichment of organoids with functional EC cells that was partly dependent on stimulation of calcium signalling in a population of cells residing outside the crypt base. Inducible Pax4 overexpression, in ileal organoids, uncovered its importance as a component of early human endocrine specification and highlighted the potential existence of two major endocrine lineages, the early appearing enterochromaffin lineage and the later developing peptidergic lineage which contains classical gut hormone cell types.                Our data provide proof-of-concept for the controlled manipulation of specific endocrine lineages with small molecules, whilst also shedding new light on human EEC differentiation and its similarity to the mouse. Given their diverse roles, understanding endocrine lineage plasticity and its control could have multiple therapeutic implications.                Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32232483        	An intestinal organoid-based platform that recreates susceptibility to T-cell-mediated tissue injury.            	A goal in precision medicine is to use patient-derived material to predict disease course and intervention outcomes. Here, we use mechanistic observations in a preclinical animal model to design an ex vivo platform that recreates genetic susceptibility to T-cell-mediated damage. Intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. We found that intestinal GVHD in mice deficient in Atg16L1, an autophagy gene that is polymorphic in humans, is reversed by inhibiting necroptosis. We further show that cocultured allogeneic T cells kill Atg16L1-mutant intestinal organoids from mice, which was associated with an aberrant epithelial interferon signature. Using this information, we demonstrate that pharmacologically inhibiting necroptosis or interferon signaling protects human organoids derived from individuals harboring a common ATG16L1 variant from allogeneic T-cell attack. Our study provides a roadmap for applying findings in animal models to individualized therapy that targets affected tissues.                © 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.	
32632269        	An organoid-based drug screening identified a menin-MLL inhibitor for endometrial cancer through regulating the HIF pathway.            	Tumor organoids recapitulate pathological properties and would serve as an excellent ex vivo model for drug discovery. Here, we performed an unbiased drug screening on drivers-defined tumor organoids from mouse endometrial cancer, the most prevalent gynecological malignancy in human, with a small molecule library targeting epigenetic factors. Among them, menin-MLL inhibitors MI-136 and MI-463 scored. The therapeutic capacity of MI-136 was further validated in tumor organoids in vitro and an orthotopic model in vivo. CRISPR/cas9-mediated mutations of major components of the menin-MLL complex, Men1, Kmt2a and Ash2l, inhibited the growth of tumor organoids, suggesting that the complex was the target of MI-136. Transcriptome analysis showed that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway was the most significantly downregulated pathway by MI-136 treatment. Consistently, Men1, Kmt2a, and Ash2l knockout also repressed the expressions of the HIF target genes. Loss of Hif1a or Hif1b partially phenocopied the inhibition of the menin-MLL complex by MI-136 or mutations in term of tumor organoid growth. Further, we found that MEN1 was upregulated in human endometrial cancers, which were tightly correlated with the expression levels of HIF1A, and associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, MI-136 also significantly inhibited the growth of endometrial cancer organoids derived from patients. Thus, our study identified MI-136 as a potential inhibitor for endometrial cancer through regulating the HIF pathway, a novel molecular mechanism distinguished from those in AML and prostate cancer.	
29945941        	Integrative multi-omics analysis of intestinal organoid differentiation.            	Intestinal organoids accurately recapitulate epithelial homeostasis in vivo, thereby representing a powerful in vitro system to investigate lineage specification and cellular differentiation. Here, we applied a multi-omics framework on stem cell-enriched and stem cell-depleted mouse intestinal organoids to obtain a holistic view of the molecular mechanisms that drive differential gene expression during adult intestinal stem cell differentiation. Our data revealed a global rewiring of the transcriptome and proteome between intestinal stem cells and enterocytes, with the majority of dynamic protein expression being transcription-driven. Integrating absolute mRNA and protein copy numbers revealed post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Probing the epigenetic landscape identified a large number of cell-type-specific regulatory elements, which revealed Hnf4g as a major driver of enterocyte differentiation. In summary, by applying an integrative systems biology approach, we uncovered multiple layers of gene expression regulation, which contribute to lineage specification and plasticity of the mouse small intestinal epithelium.                © 2018 The Authors.

28124153        	Gastric Organoids: An Emerging Model System to Study Helicobacter pylori Pathogenesis.            	Helicobacter research classically uses fixed human tissue, animal models or cancer cell lines. Each of these study objects has its advantages and has brought central insights into the infection process. Nevertheless, in model systems for basic and medical research, there is a gap between two-dimensional and most often transformed cell cultures and three-dimensional, highly organized tissues. In recent years, stem cell research has provided the means to fill this gap. The identification of the niche factors that support growth, expansion and differentiation of stem cells in vitro has allowed the development of three-dimensional culture systems called organoids. Gastric organoids are grown from gastric stem cells and are organized epithelial structures that comprise all the differentiated cell types of the stomach. They can be expanded without apparent limitation and are amenable to a wide range of standard laboratory techniques. Here, we review different stem cell-derived organoid model systems useful for Helicobacter pylori research and outline their advantages for infection studies.

28220493        	Dawn of the organoid era: 3D tissue and organ cultures revolutionize the study of development, disease, and regeneration.            	Novel and updated approaches of culturing cells in 3D are rapidly advancing our understanding of development, health, and disease. As tissues have been found to behave more realistically in 3D than in 2D cultures, organoid technology in combination with recent advances in the isolation and generation of stem cells, has rapidly become a promising concept in developmental and regenerative research. The development of all kinds of tissues can now be studied "in a dish," allowing more detailed observations of stem cell maintenance, morphogens, and differentiation. This review explores how organoids have revolutionized academic research over the last 4 decades, and how they may continue to do so. It also addresses remaining hurdles in 3D cell culturing, and how they may be overcome.                © 2017 The Authors. BioEssays Published by WILEY Periodicals, Inc.	
32714922        	Congruence of Transcription Programs in Adult Stem Cell-Derived Jejunum Organoids and Original Tissue During Long-Term Culture.            	The emergence of intestinal organoids, as a stem cell-based self-renewable model system, has led to many studies on intestinal development and cell-cell signaling. However, potential issues regarding the phenotypic stability and reproducibility of the methodology during culture still needs to be addressed for different organoids. Here we investigated the transcriptomes of jejunum organoids derived from the same pig as well as batch-to-batch variation of organoids derived from different pigs over long-term passage. The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, including small intestine specific genes, for at least 17 passages. Minor differences in gene expression were observed between individual organoid cultures. In contrast, most small intestine-specific genes were not expressed in the jejunum cell line IPEC-J2, which also showed gene expression consistent with cancer phenotypes. We conclude that intestinal organoids provide a robust and stable model for translational research with clear advantages over transformed cells.

32702796        	[Application of Organoids in Lung Cancer Precision Medicine].            	Precision medicine is an approach to rational treatment selection in the overall management of lung cancer nowadays. The introduction of the patient-derived organoid (PDO) model has established the "black-box" decision-making system from the perspective of in-vitro functional models. This may assist as a complement to the treatment selection strategy based on gene-drug correlation. Further validation must be done in multi-dimensional characteristics recapitulation of the primary tumor in organoids and in large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials. This article will give an introduction to the organoid model and review the application scenarios of organoids in the context of the precise treatment of existing lung cancer.	
32932592        	Development of Feline Ileum- and Colon-Derived Organoids and Their Potential Use to Support Feline Coronavirus Infection.            	Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) infect both wild and domestic cat populations world-wide. FCoVs present as two main biotypes: the mild feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and the fatal feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). FIPV develops through mutations from FECV during a persistence infection. So far, the molecular mechanism of FECV-persistence and contributing factors for FIPV development may not be studied, since field FECV isolates do not grow in available cell culture models. In this work, we aimed at establishing feline ileum and colon organoids that allow the propagation of field FECVs. We have determined the best methods to isolate, culture and passage feline ileum and colon organoids. Importantly, we have demonstrated using GFP-expressing recombinant field FECV that colon organoids are able to support infection of FECV, which were unable to infect traditional feline cell culture models. These organoids in combination with recombinant FECVs can now open the door to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which FECV can persist in the gut for a longer period of time and how transition to FIPV is achieved.	
29215633        	Measuring mutation accumulation in single human adult stem cells by whole-genome sequencing of organoid cultures.            	Characterization of mutational processes in adult stem cells (ASCs) will improve our understanding of aging-related diseases, such as cancer and organ failure, and may ultimately help prevent the development of these diseases. Here, we present a method for cataloging mutations in individual human ASCs without the necessity of using error-prone whole-genome amplification. Single ASCs are expanded in vitro into clonal organoid cultures to generate sufficient DNA for accurate whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis. We developed a data-analysis pipeline that identifies with high confidence somatic variants that accumulated in vivo in the original ASC. These genome-wide mutation catalogs are valuable resources for the characterization of the underlying mutational mechanisms. In addition, this protocol can be used to determine the effects of culture conditions or mutagen exposure on mutation accumulation in ASCs in vitro. Here, we describe a protocol for human liver ASCs that can be completed over a period of 3-4 months with hands-on time of ∼5 d.

33451982        	A CRISPR/Cas9-engineered ARID1A-deficient human gastric cancer organoid model reveals essential and non-essential modes of oncogenic transformation.            	Mutations in ARID1A rank amongst the most common molecular aberrations in human cancer. However, oncogenic consequences of ARID1A mutation in human cells remain poorly defined due to lack of forward genetic models. Here, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ARID1A knockout in primary TP53-/- human gastric organoids induced morphologic dysplasia, tumorigenicity and mucinous differentiation. Genetic Wnt/B-catenin activation rescued mucinous differentiation, but not hyperproliferation, suggesting alternative pathways of ARID1A KO-mediated transformation. ARID1A mutation induced transcriptional regulatory modules characteristic of MSI and EBV subtype human gastric cancer, including FOXM1-associated mitotic genes and BIRC5/survivin. Convergently, high-throughput compound screening indicated selective vulnerability of ARID1A-deficient organoids to inhibition of BIRC5/survivin, functionally implicating this pathway as an essential mediator of ARID1A KO-dependent early-stage gastric tumorigenesis. Overall, we define distinct pathways downstream of oncogenic ARID1A mutation, with non-essential Wnt-inhibited mucinous differentiation in parallel with essential transcriptional FOXM1/BIRC5-stimulated proliferation, illustrating the general utility of organoid-based forward genetic cancer analysis in human cells.

28757181        	Tumor Organoids as a Pre-clinical Cancer Model for Drug Discovery.            	Tumor organoids are 3D cultures of cancer cells that can be derived on an individual patient basis with a high success rate. This creates opportunities to build large biobanks with relevant patient material that can be used to perform drug screens and facilitate drug development. The high take rate will also allow side-by-side comparison to evaluate the translational potential of this model system to the patient. These tumors-in-a-dish can be established for a variety of tumor types including colorectal, pancreas, stomach, prostate, and breast cancers. In this review, we highlight what is currently known about tumor organoid culture, the advantages and challenges of the model system, compare it with other pre-clinical cancer models, and evaluate its value for drug development.

31748205        	Use of hPSC-derived 3D organoids and mouse genetics to define the roles of YAP in the development of the esophagus.            	Balanced progenitor activities are crucial for the development and maintenance of high turn-over organs such as the esophagus. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these progenitor activities in the esophagus remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that Yap is required for the proliferation of esophageal progenitor cells (EPCs) in the developing murine esophagus. We found that Yap deficiency reduces EPC proliferation and stratification whereas persistent Yap activation increases cell proliferation and causes aberrant stratification of the developing esophagus. We further demonstrated that the role of YAP signaling is conserved in the developing human esophagus by utilizing 3D human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived esophageal organoid culture. Taken together, our studies combining loss/gain-of-function murine models and hPSC differentiation support a key role for YAP in the self-renewal of EPCs and stratification of the esophageal epithelium.                © 2019.

33620068        	Lipid Profiling of Mouse Intestinal Organoids for studying APC Mutations.            	Inactivating mutations including both germline and somatic mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene drives most familial and sporadic colorectal cancers. Understanding the metabolic implications of this mutation will aid to establish its wider impact on cellular behaviour and potentially inform clinical decisions. However, to date, alterations in lipid metabolism induced by APC mutations remain unclear. Intestinal organoids have gained widespread popularity in studying colorectal cancer and chemotherapies, because their three-dimensional structure more accurately mimics an in vivo environment. Here, we aimed to investigate intra-cellular lipid disturbances induced by APC gene mutations in intestinal organoids using a reversed-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RP-UHPLC-MS)-based lipid profiling method. Lipids of the organoids grown from either wildtype (WT) or mice with Apc mutations (Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2Apcfl/fl) were extracted and analysed using RP-UHPLC-MS. Concentrations of phospholipids (e.g. PC(16:0/16:0), PC(18:1/20:0), PC(38:0), PC(18:1/22:1)), ceramides (e.g. Cer(d18:0/22:0), Cer(d42:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1)) and hexosylceramide (e.g. HexCer(d18:1/16:0), HexCer(d18:1/22:0))   were higher in Apcfl/fl organoids, whereas levels of sphingomyelins (e.g. SM(d18:1/14:0), SM(d18:1/16:0) ) were lower compared to WT. These observations indicate that cellular metabolism of sphingomyelin was upregulated, resulting in the cellular accumulation of ceramides and production of HexCer due to the absence of Apcfl/fl in the organoids. Our observations demonstrated lipid profiling of organoids and provided an enhanced insight into the effects of the APC mutations on lipid metabolism, making for a valuable addition to screening options of the organoid lipidome.

32258040        	Modeling Cell Communication in Cancer With Organoids: Making the Complex Simple.            	Homotypic and heterotypic interactions between cells are of crucial importance in multicellular organisms for the maintenance of physiological functions. Accordingly, changes in cell-to-cell communication contribute significantly to tumor development. Cancer cells engage the different components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) to support malignant proliferation, escape immune control, and favor metastatic spreading. The interaction between cancerous and non-cancerous cell types within tumors occurs in many ways, including physical contact and paracrine signaling. Furthermore, local and long-range transfer of biologically active molecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, and proteins) can be mediated by small extracellular vesicles (EVs) and this has been shown to influence many aspects of tumor progression. As it stands, there is a critical need for suitable experimental systems that enable modeling the cell-to-cell communications occurring in cancer. Given their intrinsic complexity, animal models represent the ideal system to study cell-to-cell interaction between different cell types; however, they might make difficult to assess individual contribution to a given phenotype. On the other hand, simplest experimental models (i.e., in vitro culture systems) might be of great use when weighing individual contributions to a given phenomenon, yet it is imperative that they share a considerable number of features with human cancer. Of the many culture systems available to the scientific community, patient-derived organoids already proved to faithfully recapitulate many of the traits of patients' disease, including genetic heterogeneity and response to therapy. The organoid technology offers several advantages over conventional monolayer cell cultures, including the preservation of the topology of cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions as observed in vivo. Several studies have shown that organoid cultures can be successfully used to study interaction between cancer cells and cellular components of the TME. Here, we discuss the potential of using organoids to model the interplay between cancer and non-cancer cells in order to unveil biological mechanisms involved in cancers initiation and progression, which might ultimately lead to the identification of novel intervention strategy for those diseases.

32500020        	Metabolic Heterogeneity in Patient Tumor-Derived Organoids by Primary Site and Drug Treatment.            	New tools are needed to match cancer patients with effective treatments. Patient-derived organoids offer a high-throughput platform to personalize treatments and discover novel therapies. Currently, methods to evaluate drug response in organoids are limited because they overlook cellular heterogeneity. In this study, non-invasive optical metabolic imaging (OMI) of cellular heterogeneity was characterized in breast cancer (BC) and pancreatic cancer (PC) patient-derived organoids. Baseline heterogeneity was analyzed for each patient, demonstrating that single-cell techniques, such as OMI, are required to capture the complete picture of heterogeneity present in a sample. Treatment-induced changes in heterogeneity were also analyzed, further demonstrating that these measurements greatly complement current techniques that only gauge average cellular response. Finally, OMI of cellular heterogeneity in organoids was evaluated as a predictor of clinical treatment response for the first time. Organoids were treated with the same drugs as the patient's prescribed regimen, and OMI measurements of heterogeneity were compared to patient outcome. OMI distinguished subpopulations of cells with divergent and dynamic responses to treatment in living organoids without the use of labels or dyes. OMI of organoids agreed with long-term therapeutic response in patients. With these capabilities, OMI could serve as a sensitive high-throughput tool to identify optimal therapies for individual patients, and to develop new effective therapies that address cellular heterogeneity in cancer.

29440675        	In vitro patient-derived 3D mesothelioma tumor organoids facilitate patient-centric therapeutic screening.            	Variability in patient response to anti-cancer drugs is currently addressed by relating genetic mutations to chemotherapy through precision medicine. However, practical benefits of precision medicine to therapy design are less clear. Even after identification of mutations, oncologists are often left with several drug options, and for some patients there is no definitive treatment solution. There is a need for model systems to help predict personalized responses to chemotherapeutics. We have microengineered 3D tumor organoids directly from fresh tumor biopsies to provide patient-specific models with which treatment optimization can be performed before initiation of therapy. We demonstrate the initial implementation of this platform using tumor biospecimens surgically removed from two mesothelioma patients. First, we show the ability to biofabricate and maintain viable 3D tumor constructs within a tumor-on-a-chip microfluidic device. Second, we demonstrate that results of on-chip chemotherapy screening mimic those observed in subjects themselves. Finally, we demonstrate mutation-specific drug testing by considering the results of precision medicine genetic screening and confirming the effectiveness of the non-standard compound 3-deazaneplanocin A for an identified mutation. This patient-derived tumor organoid strategy is adaptable to a wide variety of cancers and may provide a framework with which to improve efforts in precision medicine oncology.	
31905853        	PP2A Deficiency Enhances Carcinogenesis of Lgr5+ Intestinal Stem Cells Both in Organoids and In Vivo.            	In most cancers, cellular origin and the contribution of intrinsic and extrinsic factors toward transformation remain elusive. Cell specific carcinogenesis models are currently unavailable. To investigate cellular origin in carcinogenesis, we developed a tumorigenesis model based on a combination of carcinogenesis and genetically engineered mouse models. We show in organoids that treatment of any of three carcinogens, DMBA, MNU, or PhIP, with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) knockout induced tumorigenesis in Lgr5+ intestinal lineage, but not in differentiated cells. These transformed cells increased in stem cell signature, were upregulated in EMT markers, and acquired tumorigenecity. A mechanistic approach demonstrated that tumorigenesis was dependent on Wnt, PI3K, and RAS-MAPK activation. In vivo combination with carcinogen and PP2A depletion also led to tumor formation. Using whole-exome sequencing, we demonstrate that these intestinal tumors display mutation landscape and core driver pathways resembling human intestinal tumor in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These data provide a basis for understanding the interplay between extrinsic carcinogen and intrinsic genetic modification and suggest that PP2A functions as a tumor suppressor in intestine carcinogenesis.	
29209911        	MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging for Evaluation of Therapeutics in Colorectal Tumor Organoids.            	Patient-derived colorectal tumor organoids (CTOs) closely recapitulate the complex morphological, phenotypic, and genetic features observed in in vivo tumors. Therefore, evaluation of drug distribution and metabolism in this model system can provide valuable information to predict the clinical outcome of a therapeutic response in individual patients. In this report, we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to examine the spatial distribution of the drug irinotecan and its metabolites in CTOs from two patients. Irinotecan is a prodrug and is often prescribed as part of therapeutic regimes for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Irinotecan shows a time-dependent and concentration-dependent permeability and metabolism in the CTOs. More interestingly, the active metabolite SN-38 does not co-localize well with the parent drug irinotecan and the inactive metabolite SN-38G. The phenotypic effect of irinotecan metabolism was also confirmed by a viability study showing significantly reduced proliferation in the drug treated CTOs. MALDI-MSI can be used to investigate various pharmaceutical compounds in CTOs derived from different patients.

Lgr5 marks stem cells in digestive epithelial tissues by lineage tracing, and in vitro ever-expansion of Lgr5 stem cells form organoids, which can be directed to differentiate into functional somatic cells. Organoids derived from gastrointestinal epithelium even recapitulate the morphologic features of their in vivo counterpart. Culture conditions are also modified to establish cancer organoids from individual patients. With great genetic stability during derivation and expansion, organoids retain either single mutation in patients with inherited disease or multiple mutations of cancer tissues. Together with efficient gene-editing protocol, organoids are emerging as powerful in vitro disease models.                 © 2016 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.	
33575256        	A Semi-automated Organoid Screening Method Demonstrates Epigenetic Control of Intestinal Epithelial Differentiation.            	Intestinal organoids are an excellent model to study epithelial biology. Yet, the selection of analytical tools to accurately quantify heterogeneous organoid cultures remains limited. Here, we developed a semi-automated organoid screening method, which we applied to a library of highly specific chemical probes to identify epigenetic regulators of intestinal epithelial biology. The role of epigenetic modifiers in adult stem cell systems, such as the intestinal epithelium, is still undefined. Based on this resource dataset, we identified several targets that affected epithelial cell differentiation, including HDACs, EP300/CREBBP, LSD1, and type I PRMTs, which were verified by complementary methods. For example, we show that inhibiting type I PRMTs, which leads enhanced epithelial differentiation, blocks the growth of adenoma but not normal organoid cultures. Thus, epigenetic probes are powerful tools to study intestinal epithelial biology and may have therapeutic potential.

32044522        	Efficacy of primary liver organoid culture from different stages of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mouse model.            	Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which eventually leads to hepatocellular carcinoma. Although several animal models were developed to understand the mechanisms of NASH pathogenesis and progression, it remains obscure. A 3D organoid culture system can recapitulate organ structures and maintain gene expression profiles of original tissues. We therefore tried to generate liver organoids from different degrees [defined as mild (NASH A), moderate (NASH B) and severe (NASH C)] of methionine- and choline-deficient diet-induced NASH model mice and analyzed the difference of their architecture, cell components, organoid-forming efficacy, and gene expression profiles. Organoids from each stage of NASH model mice were successfully generated. Interestingly, epithelial-mesenchymal transition was observed in NASH C organoids. Expression of Collagen I and an activated hepatic stellite cell marker, α-sma was upregulated in the liver organoids from NASH B and C mice. The analysis of RNA sequencing revealed that several novel genes were upregulated in all NASH liver organoids. These results suggest that our generated liver organoids from different stages of NASH diseased mice might become a useful tool for in vitro studies of the molecular mechanism of NASH development and also for identifying novel biomarkers for early diagnosis of NASH disease.

31939100        	Organoid of ovarian cancer: genomic analysis and drug screening.            	Ovarian cancer is the most common malignant tumors of the female reproductive system, and its standard treatments are cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Great advances have been achieved in novel treatment strategies, including targeted therapy and immunotherapy. However, ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecological tumors due to therapeutic resistance and the gap between preclinical data and actual clinical efficacy. Organoids are a 3D culture model that markedly affects gene analysis, drug screening, and drug sensitivity determination of tumors, especially when used in targeted therapy and immunotherapy. In addition, organoid can lead to advances in the preclinical research of ovarian cancer due to its convenient cultivation, good genetic stability, and high homology with primary tumors.	
32881601        	3D Co-culture of Cancer-Associated Fibroblast with Oral Cancer Organoids.            	Limits of the available model have, in the long term, challenged the studies of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their interplay with cancer stem cells, one of the key driving forces of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the present study, the 3-dimensional organoid model was employed to investigate whether co-culture with paralleled CAFs promotes stem-like properties of OSCC. Experimentally, tumor organoids and paralleled CAFs were generated from patients with OSCC. Then, the CD44+ cells in organoids were sorted out by flow cytometry and co-cultured with CAFs in Matrigel. The results showed that co-culture with CAFs enhances the organoid-forming ability of CD44+ cells and that this effect was blocked when production or uptake of lactate in CAFs or CD44+ cells was inhibited. Furthermore, the expression levels of CD44 and OCT-4 were detected in organoids incubated with lactate, via immunofluorescence or Western blot assay. The results demonstrated that treatments with lactate promote the organoid-forming ability of CD44+ cells, as well as the expression of CD44 and OCT-4 at the protein level in OSCC organoids.	
32705648        	Generating and Utilizing Murine Cas9-Expressing Intestinal Organoids for Large-Scale Knockout Genetic Screening.            	Organoid culture faithfully reproduces the in vivo characteristics of the intestinal/colon epithelium and elucidates molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of stem cell compartment that, if altered, may lead tumorigenesis. CRISPR-Cas9 based editing technology has provided promising opportunities for targeted loss-of-function mutations at chosen sites in the genome of eukaryotes. Herein, we demonstrate a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis-based screening method using murine intestinal organoids by investigating the phenotypical morphology of Cas9-expressing murine intestinal organoids. Murine intestinal crypts can be isolated and seeded into Matrigel and grown into stable organoid lines. Organoids subsequently transduced and selected to generate Cas9 expressing organoids. These organoids can be further transduced with the second lentiviruses expressing guide RNA (gRNA) (s) and screened for 8-10 days using bright-field and fluorescent microscopy to determine possible morphological or phenotypical abnormalities. Via phenotypical screening analysis, the candidate knockouts can be selected based on differential abnormal growth pattern vs their untransduced or lenti-GFP transduced controls. Further assessment of these knockout organoids can be done via phalloidin and propidium iodide (PI) staining, proliferation assay and qRT-PCR and also biochemical analysis. This CRISPR/Cas9 organoid mutagenesis-based screening method provides a reliable and rapid approach for investigating large numbers of genes with unknown/poorly identified biological functions. Knockout intestinal organoids can be associated with the key biological function of the gene(s) in development, homeostasis, disease progression, tumorigenesis, and drug screening, thereby reducing and potentially replacing animal models.	
31814611        	Evaluating the Differentiation Capacity of Mouse Prostate Epithelial Cells Using Organoid Culture.            	The prostate epithelium is comprised predominantly of basal and luminal cells. In vivo lineage tracing has been utilized to define the differentiation capacity of mouse prostate basal and luminal cells during development, tissue-regeneration and transformation. However, evaluating cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of prostate epithelial differentiation capacity using a lineage tracing approach often requires extensive breeding and can be cost-prohibitive. In the prostate organoid assay, basal and luminal cells generate prostatic epithelium ex vivo. Importantly, primary epithelial cells can be isolated from mice of any genetic background or mice treated with any number of small molecules prior to, or after, plating into three-dimensional (3D) culture. Sufficient material for evaluation of differentiation capacity is generated after 7-10 days. Collection of basal-derived and luminal-derived organoids for (1) protein analysis by Western blot and (2) immunohistochemical analysis of intact organoids by whole-mount confocal microscopy enables researchers to evaluate the ex vivo differentiation capacity of prostate epithelial cells. When used in combination, these two approaches provide complementary information about the differentiation capacity of prostate basal and luminal cells in response to genetic or pharmacological manipulation.	
33377106        	High-throughput drug screening of fine-needle aspiration-derived cancer organoids.            	Generation of fine-needle aspiration (FNA)-derived cancer organoids has allowed us to develop a number of downstream applications. In this protocol, we start with organoids cultured in a semi-solid format. We dissociate organoids into single cells and then plate in a 384-well format for high-throughput drug screening. While this method must be fine-tuned for each individual organoid culture, it offers a format well suited for rapidly screening medium-sized drug/compound libraries (500-5,000 molecules) and generating dose-response curves to measure relative efficacy. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Lee et al. (2020) and Vilgelm et al. (2020).                © 2020 The Authors.	
26643275        	The Notch and Wnt pathways regulate stemness and differentiation in human fallopian tube organoids.            	The epithelial lining of the fallopian tube is of critical importance for human reproduction and has been implicated as a site of origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Here we report on the establishment of long-term, stable 3D organoid cultures from human fallopian tubes, indicative of the presence of adult stem cells. We show that single epithelial stem cells in vitro can give rise to differentiated organoids containing ciliated and secretory cells. Continuous growth and differentiation of organoids depend on both Wnt and Notch paracrine signalling. Microarray analysis reveals that inhibition of Notch signalling causes downregulation of stem cell-associated genes in parallel with decreased proliferation and increased numbers of ciliated cells and that organoids also respond to oestradiol and progesterone treatment in a physiological manner. Thus, our organoid model provides a much-needed basis for future investigations of signalling routes involved in health and disease of the fallopian tube.

32158973        	Establishment of patient-derived three-dimensional organoid culture in renal cell carcinoma.            	Renal cell carcinoma is a heterogeneous kidney cancer, and over 403,000 cases were reported worldwide in 2018. Current methods for studying renal cell carcinoma are limited to two-dimensional (2D) culture of primary cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. Numerous studies have suggested that 2D culture poorly represents the diversity, heterogeneity, and drug-resistance of primary tumors. The time and cost associated with patient-derived xenograft models poses a realistic barrier to their clinical utility. As a biomimetic model, patient-derived three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture can overcome these disadvantages and bridge the gap between in vitro cell culture and in vivo patient-derived xenograft models. Here, we establish a patient-derived 3D organoid culture system for clear cell renal cell carcinoma and demonstrate the biomimetic characteristics of our model with respect to both primary kidney cancer and conventional 2D culture.                Normal renal tissues and tumor tissues were collected from patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The dissociated cells were cultured as conventional 2D culture and 3D organoid culture. The biomimetic characteristic of the two cultures were compared.                Compared with 2D culture, the 3D organoid cultures retained the characteristic lipid-rich, clear cell morphology of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Carbonic anhydrase 9 and vimentin were validated as biomarkers of renal cell carcinoma. Expression of the two validated biomarkers was more enhanced in 3D organoid culture.                Patient-derived 3D organoid culture retains the characteristics of renal cell carcinoma with respect to morphology and biomarker expression.                © The Korean Urological Association, 2020.	
29539434        	Expansion of Adult Human Pancreatic Tissue Yields Organoids Harboring Progenitor Cells with Endocrine Differentiation Potential.            	Generating an unlimited source of human insulin-producing cells is a prerequisite to advance β cell replacement therapy for diabetes. Here, we describe a 3D culture system that supports the expansion of adult human pancreatic tissue and the generation of a cell subpopulation with progenitor characteristics. These cells display high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDHhi), express pancreatic progenitors markers (PDX1, PTF1A, CPA1, and MYC), and can form new organoids in contrast to ALDHlo cells. Interestingly, gene expression profiling revealed that ALDHhi cells are closer to human fetal pancreatic tissue compared with adult pancreatic tissue. Endocrine lineage markers were detected upon in vitro differentiation. Engrafted organoids differentiated toward insulin-positive (INS+) cells, and circulating human C-peptide was detected upon glucose challenge 1 month after transplantation. Engrafted ALDHhi cells formed INS+ cells. We conclude that adult human pancreatic tissue has potential for expansion into 3D structures harboring progenitor cells with endocrine differentiation potential.

33209645        	Patient-derived cell line, xenograft and organoid models in lung cancer therapy.            	Lung cancer accounts for most cancer-related deaths worldwide and has an overall 5-year survival rate of ~15%. Cell lines have played important roles in the study of cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets, as well as pre-clinical testing of novel drugs. However, most experimental therapies that have cleared preclinical testing using established cell lines have failed phase III clinical trials. This suggests that such models may not adequately recapitulate patient tumor biology and clinical outcome predictions. Here, we discuss and compare different pre-clinical lung cancer models, including established cell lines, patient-derived cell lines, xenografts and organoids, summarize the methodology for generating these models, and review their relative advantages and limitations in different oncologic research applications. We further discuss additional gaps in patient-derived pre-clinical models to better recapitulate tumor biology and improve their clinical predictive power.                2020 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

23507921        	Immunotherapeutic organoids: a new approach to cancer treatment.            	Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the treatment of cancer and other diseases. However, several limitations of antibody-based treatments, such as the cost of therapy and the achievement of sustained plasma levels, should be still addressed for their widespread use as therapeutics. The use of cell and gene transfer methods offers additional benefits by producing a continuous release of the antibody with syngenic glycosylation patterns, which makes the antibody potentially less immunogenic. In vivo secretion of therapeutic antibodies by viral vector delivery or ex vivo gene modified long-lived autologous or allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells may advantageously replace repeated injection of clinical-grade antibodies. Gene-modified autologous mesenchymal stem cells can be delivered subcutaneously embedded in a non-immunogenic synthetic extracellular matrix-based scaffold that guarantees the survival of the cell inoculum. The scaffold would keep cells at the implantation site, with the therapeutic protein acting at distance (immunotherapeutic organoid), and could be retrieved once the therapeutic effect is fulfilled. In the present review we highlight the practical importance of living cell factories for in vivo secretion of recombinant antibodies.	
32984947        	Establishment of PDX-derived salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cell lines using organoid culture method.            	To generate a reliable preclinical model system exhibiting the molecular features of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) whose biology is still unclear due to the paucity of stable cell cultures. To develop new in vitro and in vivo models of ACC, the techniques of organoid culture and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX), which have attracted attention in other malignancies in recent years, were applied. Tumor specimens from surgically resected salivary ACC were proceeded for the preparation of PDX and organoid culture. The orthotopic transplantation of patient-derived or PDX-derived organoids was demonstrated into submandibular glands of NSG mice and those histology was evaluated. PDX-derived organoid cells were evaluated for the presence of MYB-mediated fusion genes and proceeded for in vitro drug sensitivity assay. Human ACC-derived organoids were successfully generated in three-dimensional culture and confirmed the ability of these cells to form tumors by orthotopic injection. Short-term organoid cell cultures from two individual ACC PDX tumors were also established that maintain the characteristic MYBL1 translocation and histological features of the original parent and PDX tumors. Finally, the establishment of drug sensitivity tests on these short-term cultured cells was confirmed using three different agents. This is the first to report an approach for the generation of human ACC-derived organoids as in vitro and in vivo cancer models, providing insights into understanding of the ACC biology and creating personalized therapy design for patients with ACC.                © 2020 Union for International Cancer Control.	
33137568        	Modeling cancer progression using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cells and organoids.            	Conventional cancer cell lines and animal models have been mainstays of cancer research. More recently, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and hPSC-derived organoid technologies, together with genome engineering approaches, have provided a complementary platform to model cancer progression. Here, we review the application of these technologies in cancer modeling with respect to the cell-of-origin, cancer propagation, and metastasis. We further discuss the benefits and challenges accompanying the use of hPSC models for cancer research and discuss their broad applicability in drug discovery, biomarker identification, decoding molecular mechanisms, and the deconstruction of clonal and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. In summary, hPSC-derived organoids provide powerful models to recapitulate the pathogenic states in cancer and to perform drug discovery.                Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

29472484        	Patient-derived organoids model treatment response of metastatic gastrointestinal cancers.            	Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have recently emerged as robust preclinical models; however, their potential to predict clinical outcomes in patients has remained unclear. We report on a living biobank of PDOs from metastatic, heavily pretreated colorectal and gastroesophageal cancer patients recruited in phase 1/2 clinical trials. Phenotypic and genotypic profiling of PDOs showed a high degree of similarity to the original patient tumors. Molecular profiling of tumor organoids was matched to drug-screening results, suggesting that PDOs could complement existing approaches in defining cancer vulnerabilities and improving treatment responses. We compared responses to anticancer agents ex vivo in organoids and PDO-based orthotopic mouse tumor xenograft models with the responses of the patients in clinical trials. Our data suggest that PDOs can recapitulate patient responses in the clinic and could be implemented in personalized medicine programs.

33478323        	Oral Organoids: Progress and Challenges.            	Oral organoids are complex 3-dimensional structures that develop from stem cells or organ-specific progenitors through a process of self-organization and re-create architectures and functionalities similar to in vivo organs and tissues in the oral and maxillofacial region. Recently, striking advancements have been made in the construction and application of oral organoids of the tooth, salivary gland, and tongue. Dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells isolated from tooth germs or derived from pluripotent stem cells could generate tooth germ-like organoids by self-organization in a specific culture system. Tooth organoids can also be constructed based on tissue engineering principles by seeding stem cells on a scaffold with the bioregulatory functions of odontogenic differentiation. Two main approaches have been used to construct salivary gland organoids: 1) incubation of salivary gland-derived stem/progenitor cells in a 3-dimensional culture system to form the structure of the gland through mimicking regenerative processes and 2) inducing of pluripotent stem cells to generate embryonic salivary glands by replicating the development process. Taste bud organoids can be generated by embedding isolated circumvallate papilla tissue in Matrigel with a mixture of growth factors, while lingual epithelial organoids have been constructed using lingual stem cells in a suitable culture system containing specific signaling molecules. These oral organoids usually maintain the main functions and characteristic structures of the corresponding organ to a certain extent. Furthermore, using cells isolated from patients, oral organoids could replicate specific diseases such as maxillofacial tumors and tooth dysplasia. Until now, oral organoids have been applied in the study of mechanisms of tooth development, pathology and regeneration of the salivary gland, and precision therapeutics for tongue cancer. These findings strongly demonstrate that the organoid technique is a novel paradigm for the study of the development, pathology, and regeneration of oral and maxillofacial tissue.	
31367270        	Utilizing gastric cancer organoids to assess tumor biology and personalize medicine.            	While the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer (GC) have declined due to public health programs, it remains the third deadliest cancer worldwide. For patients with early disease, innovative endoscopic and complex surgical techniques have improved survival. However, for patients with advanced disease, there are limited treatment options and survival remains poor. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more effective therapies. Since novel therapies require extensive preclinical testing prior to human trials, it is important to identify methods to expedite this process. Traditional cancer models are restricted by the inability to accurately recapitulate the primary human tumor, exorbitant costs, and the requirement for extended periods of development time. An emerging in vitro model to study human disease is the patient-derived organoid, which is a three-dimensional system created from fresh surgical or biopsy tissues of a patient's gastric tumor. Organoids are cultured in plastic wells and suspended in a gelatinous matrix, providing a substrate for extension and growth in all dimensions. They are rapid-growing and highly representative of the molecular landscape, histology, and morphology of the various subtypes of GC. Organoids uniquely model tumor initiation and growth, including steps taken by normal stomach cells to transform into invasive, intestinal-type tumor cells. Additionally, they provide ample material for biobanking and screening novel therapies. Lastly, organoids are a promising model for personalized therapy and warrant further investigation in drug sensitivity studies for GC patients.	
30337647        	Neurogenin3 phosphorylation controls reprogramming efficiency of pancreatic ductal organoids into endocrine cells.            	β-cell replacement has been proposed as an effective treatment for some forms of diabetes, and in vitro methods for β-cell generation are being extensively explored. A potential source of β-cells comes from fate conversion of exocrine pancreatic cells into the endocrine lineage, by overexpression of three regulators of pancreatic endocrine formation and β-cell identity, Ngn3, Pdx1 and MafA. Pancreatic ductal organoid cultures have recently been developed that can be expanded indefinitely, while maintaining the potential to differentiate into the endocrine lineage. Here, using mouse pancreatic ductal organoids, we see that co-expression of Ngn3, Pdx1 and MafA are required and sufficient to generate cells that express insulin and resemble β-cells transcriptome-wide. Efficiency of β-like cell generation can be significantly enhanced by preventing phosphorylation of Ngn3 protein and further augmented by conditions promoting differentiation. Taken together, our new findings underline the potential of ductal organoid cultures as a source material for generation of β-like cells and demonstrate that post-translational regulation of reprogramming factors can be exploited to enhance β-cell generation.	
25603995        	Prostate cancer organoids: a potential new tool for testing drug sensitivity.            	Recent technical advances have enabled for the first time, reliable in vitro culture of prostate cancer samples as prostate cancer organoids. This breakthrough provides the significant possibility of high throughput drug screening covering the spectrum of prostate cancer phenotypes seen clinically. These advances will enable precision medicine to become a reality, allowing patient samples to be screened for effective therapeutics ex vivo, with tailoring of treatments specific to that individual. This will hopefully lead to enhanced clinical outcomes, avoid morbidity due to ineffective therapies and improve the quality of life in men with advanced prostate cancer.	
28881646        	Modeling African American prostate adenocarcinoma by inducing defined genetic alterations in organoids.            	Genomic studies are rapidly identifying genetic alterations in human cancer, but functional validation of such alterations has been slow. Here, using human prostate cancer as a model, we have assessed the feasibility of engineering defined genetic alterations in well-known cancer driver genes to transform benign prostate epithelial organoids derived from African American men. Benign human prostate organoids were transduced with lentiviruses expressing MYC, shPTEN, shTP53 and AR, alone and in various combinations, to recapitulate prostate cancer development. Organoids expressing MYC, shPTEN, shTP53 and AR (denoted MPPA); MYC, shPTEN and shTP53 (MPP); or MYC (M) were significantly larger, had higher proliferation rates and demonstrated pathologically transformed morphology compared to organoids transduced with control lentivirus. Alterations in MYC, PTEN and TP53 also affected the rate of organoid basal-to-luminal differentiation in vitro. MPPA and MPP organoids expressed the clinical prostate cancer marker AMACR and developed prostate adenocarcinoma when grafted under the renal capsule in mice. These data indicate that genetic alterations commonly observed in human prostate cancer can be rapidly modeled in human organoid culture. Prostate cancer organoids provide a useful pre-clinical model for the evaluation of new candidate cancer genes, cancer disparities, and potentially for testing of novel therapeutic agents.	
31666667        	Patient-derived organoids as a potential model to predict response to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors.            	Selection of cancer patients for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors remains a challenge due to tumour heterogeneity and variable biomarker detection. PD-L1 expression in 24 surgical chordoma specimen was determined immunohistochemically with antibodies 28-8 and E1L3N. The ability of patient-derived organoids to detect treatment effects of nivolumab was explored by quantitative and qualitative immunofluorescence and FACS analysis. The more sensitive antibody, E1L3N (ROC = 0.896, p = 0.001), was associated with greater tumour diameters (p = 0.014) and detected both tumour cells and infiltrating lymphocytes in 54% of patients, but only 1-15% of their cells. Organoids generated from PD-L1-positive patients contained both tumour cells and PD-1/CD8-positive lymphocytes and responded to nivolumab treatment with marked dose-dependent diameter reductions of up to 50% and increased cell death in both PD-L1-positive and negative organoids. Patient-derived organoids may be valuable to predict individual responses to immunotherapy even in patients with low or no immunohistochemical PD-L1 expression.	
27246018        	Lentivirus-Based Stable Gene Delivery into Intestinal Organoids.            	Lentivirus-based gene delivery works efficiently for the majority of mammalian cells cultured under standard two-dimensional conditions. By contrast, intestinal epithelial organoids embedded into three-dimensional extracellular matrix appear to be resistant to lentiviral transduction. We observed that Matrigel, a matrix that reconstitutes a basement membrane and is indispensable for cell survival and proliferation, prevents lentiviruses from binding to intestinal cells. In this chapter, we describe a simple method of a highly efficient gene transduction into intestinal organoids. This method involves organoid dispersion into single intestinal epithelial cells, mixing these individual cells with lentiviral particles, plating on Matrigel, and subsequent re-embedding into Matrigel. Under these conditions, the majority of the cells are exposed to the virus in the absence of the matrix barrier while remaining attached to the matrix. Using a GFP-labeled lentivirus, we demonstrate that this method allows for highly efficient infection of intestinal organoids after overnight incubation of Matrigel-attached cells with lentiviral particles.	
33158842        	Genetically Defined, Syngeneic Organoid Platform for Developing Combination Therapies for Ovarian Cancer.            	The paucity of genetically informed, immunocompetent tumor models impedes evaluation of conventional, targeted, and immune therapies. By engineering mouse fallopian tube epithelial organoids using lentiviral gene transduction and/or CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, we generated multiple high-grade serous tubo-ovarian cancer (HGSC) models exhibiting mutational combinations seen in patients with HGSC. Detailed analysis of homologous recombination (HR)-proficient (Trp53-/-;Ccne1OE;Akt2OE;KrasOE ), HR-deficient (Trp53-/-;Brca1-/-;MycOE ), and unclassified (Trp53-/-;Pten-/-;Nf1-/- ) organoids revealed differences in in vitro properties (proliferation, differentiation, and "secretome"), copy-number aberrations, and tumorigenicity. Tumorigenic organoids had variable sensitivity to HGSC chemotherapeutics, and evoked distinct immune microenvironments that could be modulated by neutralizing organoid-produced chemokines/cytokines. These findings enabled development of a chemotherapy/immunotherapy regimen that yielded durable, T cell-dependent responses in Trp53-/-;Ccne1OE;Akt2OE;Kras HGSC; in contrast, Trp53-/-;Pten-/-;Nf1-/- tumors failed to respond. Mouse and human HGSC models showed genotype-dependent similarities in chemosensitivity, secretome, and immune microenvironment. Genotype-informed, syngeneic organoid models could provide a platform for the rapid evaluation of tumor biology and therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: The lack of genetically informed, diverse, immunocompetent models poses a major barrier to therapeutic development for many malignancies. Using engineered fallopian tube organoids to study the cell-autonomous and cell-nonautonomous effects of specific combinations of mutations found in HGSC, we suggest an effective combination treatment for the currently intractable CCNE1-amplified subgroup.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 211.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32483658        	Artificial Construction of Immune Tissues/Organoids and Their Application for Immunological Intervention.            	Human-type lymphoid tissue organoids, which stably function in our body for a certain period of time or longer, may have a great potential as immune-stimulatory or immune-regulatory devices and could be utilized in the future for the treatment of various diseases such as cancer, severe infection, autoimmunity and congenital as well as acquired immunodeficiency resulting from severe infections or aging. In this review, we discuss about rationality and trials of the synthesis of immunologically functional lymphoid tissue organoids mainly in mouse. We have been recently trying to construct immunologically functioning human-type organoids, and the efforts are also briefly described.	
31694307        	Patient-Derived Head and Neck Cancer Organoids Recapitulate EGFR Expression Levels of Respective Tissues and Are Responsive to EGFR-Targeted Photodynamic Therapy.            	Patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are currently treated with surgery and/or radio- and chemotherapy. Despite these therapeutic interventions, 40% of patients relapse, urging the need for more effective therapies. In photodynamic therapy (PDT), a light-activated photosensitizer produces reactive oxygen species that ultimately lead to cell death. Targeted PDT, using a photosensitizer conjugated to tumor-targeting molecules, has been explored as a more selective cancer therapy. Organoids are self-organizing three-dimensional structures that can be grown from both normal and tumor patient-material and have recently shown translational potential. Here, we explore the potential of a recently described HNSCC-organoid model to evaluate Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-targeted PDT, through either antibody- or nanobody-photosensitizer conjugates. We find that EGFR expression levels differ between organoids derived from different donors, and recapitulate EGFR expression levels of patient material. EGFR expression levels were found to correlate with the response to EGFR-targeted PDT. Importantly, organoids grown from surrounding normal tissues showed lower EGFR expression levels than their tumor counterparts, and were not affected by the treatment. In general, nanobody-targeted PDT was more effective than antibody-targeted PDT. Taken together, patient-derived HNSCC organoids are a useful 3D model for testing in vitro targeted PDT.	
29552622        	The Esophageal Organoid System Reveals Functional Interplay Between Notch and Cytokines in Reactive Epithelial Changes.            	Aberrations in the esophageal proliferation-differentiation gradient are histologic hallmarks in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and gastroesophageal reflux disease. A reliable protocol to grow 3-dimensional (3D) esophageal organoids is needed to study esophageal epithelial homeostasis under physiological and pathologic conditions.                We modified keratinocyte-serum free medium to grow 3D organoids from endoscopic esophageal biopsies, immortalized human esophageal epithelial cells, and murine esophagi. Morphologic and functional characterization of 3D organoids was performed following genetic and pharmacologic modifications or exposure to EoE-relevant cytokines. The Notch pathway was evaluated by transfection assays and by gene expression analyses in vitro and in biopsies.                Both murine and human esophageal 3D organoids displayed an explicit proliferation-differentiation gradient. Notch inhibition accumulated undifferentiated basal keratinocytes with deregulated squamous cell differentiation in organoids. EoE patient-derived 3D organoids displayed normal epithelial structure ex vivo in the absence of the EoE inflammatory milieu. Stimulation of esophageal 3D organoids with EoE-relevant cytokines resulted in a phenocopy of Notch inhibition in organoid 3D structures with recapitulation of reactive epithelial changes in EoE biopsies, where Notch3 expression was significantly decreased in EoE compared with control subjects.                Esophageal 3D organoids serve as a novel platform to investigate regulatory mechanisms in squamous epithelial homeostasis in the context of EoE and other diseases. Notch-mediated squamous cell differentiation is suppressed by cytokines known to be involved in EoE, suggesting that this may contribute to epithelial phenotypes associated with disease. Genetic and pharmacologic manipulations establish proof of concept for the utility of organoids for future studies and personalized medicine in EoE and other esophageal diseases.	
32218271        	Development of Prostate Cancer Organoid Culture Models in Basic Medicine and Translational Research.            	Prostate cancer (PC) is the most prevalent cancer in men and the second main cause of cancer-related death in Western society. The lack of proper PC models that recapitulate the molecular and genomic landscape of clinical disease has hampered progress toward translational research to understand the disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic responses in each patient. Although several models have been developed, they hardly emulated the complicated PC microenvironment. Precision medicine is an emerging approach predicting appropriate therapies for individual cancer patients by means of various analyses of individual genomic profiling and targeting specific cancer pathways. In PC, precision medicine also has the potential to impose changes in clinical practices. Here, we describe the various PC models with special focus on PC organoids and their values in basic medicine, personalized therapy, and translational researches in vitro and in vivo, which could help to achieve the full transformative power of cancer precision medicine.	
33388439        	Hydrogel-based colorectal cancer organoid co-culture models.            	The lack of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in patient-derived organoid (PDO) models is a major limitation as CAFs contribute to tumor progression and drug resistance. In the present study, we addressed this problem by establishing in vitro conditions that enable the co-culture of colorectal cancer (CRC) PDO with patient-derived CAFs. Considering that the CRC extracellular matrix is high in hyaluronan and collagen I, we hypothesized that hyaluronan-gelatin hydrogels may serve as a suitable alternative 3D matrix to traditionally used basement membrane extracts to support the co-culture of CRC PDO and CAFs. We report the development of in vitro models consisting of CRC PDO encapsulated within a well-defined three-dimensional (3D) hyaluronan-gelatin hydrogel and co-cultured with patient-derived CAFs. Through RNA- and whole -exome sequencing, we first show that these hydrogels are capable of maintaining key molecular characteristics of the original patient tumors in CRC PDO but not support the culture of CAFs. Further, based on our findings that CRC PDO culture medium poorly supports CAF viability, we developed a co-culture strategy that maintains the viability of both CRC PDO and CAFs. We found that even in the absence of growth factors conventionally used to support CRC PDO culture, CAFs were able to maintain the proliferation of the cultured CRC PDO in the hydrogels and restore distinct biological pathways absent in the PDO culture alone but present in patient tissues. Lastly, we demonstrate that these CRC PDO-CAFs co-culture models are suitable for evaluating standard-of-care drugs, making them potentially very useful for realizing personalized cancer medicine.

29883385        	Organoids Provide an Important Window on Inflammation in Cancer.            	Inflammation is a primary driver of cancer initiation and progression. However, the complex and dynamic nature of an inflammatory response make this a very difficult process to study. Organoids are a new model system where complex multicellular structures of primary cells can be grown in a 3D matrix to recapitulate the biology of the parent tissue. This experimental model offers several distinct advantages over alternatives including the ability to be genetically engineered, implanted in vivo and reliably derived from a wide variety of normal and cancerous tissue from patients. Furthermore, long-term organoid cultures reproduce many features of their source tissue, including genetic and epigenetic alterations and drug sensitivity. Perhaps most significantly, cancer organoids can be cocultured in a variety of different systems with a patients&rsquo; own immune cells, uniquely permitting the study of autologous cancer-immune cell interactions. Experiments with such systems promise to shed light on the mechanisms governing inflammation-associated cancer while also providing prognostic information on an individual patient&rsquo;s responsiveness to immunotherapeutic anti-cancer drugs. Thanks to their ability to capture important features of the complex relationship between a cancer and its microenvironment, organoids are poised to become an essential tool for unraveling the mechanisms by which inflammation promotes cancer.	
28459449        	In vivo genome editing and organoid transplantation models of colorectal cancer and metastasis.            	In vivo interrogation of the function of genes implicated in tumorigenesis is limited by the need to generate and cross germline mutant mice. Here we describe approaches to model colorectal cancer (CRC) and metastasis, which rely on in situ gene editing and orthotopic organoid transplantation in mice without cancer-predisposing mutations. Autochthonous tumor formation is induced by CRISPR-Cas9-based editing of the Apc and Trp53 tumor suppressor genes in colon epithelial cells and by orthotopic transplantation of Apc-edited colon organoids. ApcΔ/Δ;KrasG12D/+;Trp53Δ/Δ (AKP) mouse colon organoids and human CRC organoids engraft in the distal colon and metastasize to the liver. Finally, we apply the orthotopic transplantation model to characterize the clonal dynamics of Lgr5+ stem cells and demonstrate sequential activation of an oncogene in established colon adenomas. These experimental systems enable rapid in vivo characterization of cancer-associated genes and reproduce the entire spectrum of tumor progression and metastasis.	
30450540        	A multi-site metastasis-on-a-chip microphysiological system for assessing metastatic preference of cancer cells.            	Metastatic disease remains one of the primary reasons for cancer-related deaths, yet the majority of in vitro cancer models focus on the primary tumor sites. Here, we describe a metastasis-on-a-chip device that houses multiple bioengineered three-dimensional (3D) organoids, established by a 3D photopatterning technique employing extracellular matrix-derived hydrogel biomaterials. Specifically, cancer cells begin in colorectal cancer (CRC) organoid, which resides in a single microfluidic chamber connected to multiple downstream chambers in which liver, lung, and endothelial constructs are housed. Under recirculating fluid flow, tumor cells grow in the primary site, eventually enter circulation, and can be tracked via fluorescent imaging. Importantly, we describe that in the current version of this platform, HCT116 CRC cells preferentially home to the liver and lung constructs; the corresponding organs of which CRC metastases arise the most in human patients. We believe that in subsequent studies this platform can be implemented to better understand the mechanisms underlying metastasis, perhaps resulting in the identification of targets for intervention.                © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
31778145        	Organoid model of mammographic density displays a higher frequency of aberrant colony formations with radiation exposure.            	Aberrant three-dimensional (3D) colony organization of premalignant human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) is one of the indices of dysplasia. An experiment has been designed where the stiffness of the microenvironment, in 3D culture, has been set at either low or high level of mammographic density (MD) and the organoid models are exposed to 50 cGy X-ray radiation. This study utilizes published bioinformatics tools to quantify the frequency of aberrant colony formations by the combined stressors of stiffness and X-ray exposure. One of the goals is to develop a quantitative assay for evaluating the risk factors associated with women with high MD exposed to X-ray radiation.                Analysis of 3D colony formations indicate that high stiffness, within the range of high MD, and X-ray radiation have an approximately additive effect on increasing the frequency of aberrant colony formations. Since both stiffness and X-ray radiation are DNA-damaging stressors, the additive effect of these stressors is also independently validated by profiling activin A-secreted protein. Secretion of activin A is known to be higher in tissues with a high MD as well as tumor cells. In addition, we show that increased stiffness of the microenvironment also induces phosphorylation of γH2AX-positive foci. The study uses two HMECs derived from a diseased tissue (e.g. MCF10A) and reduction mammoplasty of normal breast tissue (e.g. 184A1) to further demonstrate similar traits in the frequency of aberrant colony organization.

30534474        	Organoid technology in disease modelling, drug development, personalized treatment and regeneration medicine.            	Organoid technology bridges the gap between conventional two-dimensional cell line culture and in vivo models. The near-physiological technology can virtually recapitulates organ development and human diseases, such as infectious diseases, genetic abnormality and even cancers. In addition, organoids can more accurately predict drug responses, and serve as an excellent platform for drug development, including efficacy evaluation, toxicity testing and pharmacokinetics analysis. Furthermore, organoids can also be exploited to explore the possible optimized treatment strategies for each individual patient. Besides, organoid technology is a promising strategy for regeneration medicine and transplantation use, which can overcome the deficiency in the supply of healthy donor tissues and inherent immunological rejection through establishing isogenic organoids from minuscule amounts of patient biopsies. Collectively, organoids hold enormous potential for clinical applications and bring basic research closer to clinical practice. In this review, we described common organoid lines, summarized the potential clinical applications, and outlined the current limitations.	
31690670        	Organoids Reveal That Inherent Radiosensitivity of Small and Large Intestinal Stem Cells Determines Organ Sensitivity.            	Tissue survival responses to ionizing radiation are nonlinear with dose, rather yielding tissue-specific descending curves that impede straightforward analysis of biologic effects. Apoptotic cell death often occurs at low doses, while at clinically relevant intermediate doses, double-strand break misrepair yields mitotic death that determines outcome. As researchers frequently use a single low dose for experimentation, such strategies may inaccurately depict inherent tissue responses. Cutting edge radiobiology has adopted full dose survival profiling and devised mathematical algorithms to fit curves to observed data to generate highly reproducible numerical data that accurately define clinically relevant inherent radiosensitivities. Here, we established a protocol for irradiating organoids that delivers radiation profiles simulating the organ of origin. This technique yielded highly similar dose-survival curves of small and large intestinal crypts in vivo and their cognate organoids analyzed by the single-hit multi-target (SHMT) algorithm, outcomes reflecting the inherent radiation profile of their respective Lgr5+ stem cell populations. As this technological advance is quantitative, it will be useful for accurate evaluation of intestinal (patho)physiology and drug screening. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings establish standards for irradiating organoids that deliver radiation profiles that phenocopy the organ of origin.See related commentary by Muschel et al., p. 927.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

29434290        	Induction of differentiation of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells to functional hepatocytes using an organoid culture system.            	Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. It is thought to originate from cholangiocytes, which are the component cells of intrahepatic bile ducts. However, as patients with viral hepatitis often develop IHCC, it has been suggested that transformed hepatocytes may play a role in IHCC development. To investigate whether IHCC cells can be converted to functional hepatocytes, we established organoids derived from human IHCC and cultured them under conditions suitable for hepatocyte differentiation. IHCC organoids after hepatocyte differentiation acquired functions of mature hepatocytes such as albumin secretion, bile acid production and increased CYP3A4 activity. Studies using a mouse model of IHCC indicate that Wnt3a derived from macrophages recruited upon inflammation in the liver may promote the malignant transformation of hepatocytes to IHCC cells. The results of the present study support the recently proposed hypothesis that IHCC cells are derived from hepatocytes.

We review the state-of-the-art in bone and marrow tissue engineering (BMTE) and hematological cancer tissue engineering (HCTE) in light of the recent interest in bone marrow environment and pathophysiology of hematological cancers. This review focuses on engineered BM tissue and organoids as in vitro models of hematological cancer therapeutics, along with identification of BM components and their integration as synthetically engineered BM mimetic scaffolds. In addition, the review details interaction dynamics of various BM and hematologic cancer (HC) cell types in co-culture systems of engineered BM tissues/phantoms as well as their relation to drug resistance and cytotoxicity. Interaction between hematological cancer cells and their niche, and the difference with respect to the healthy niche microenvironment narrated. Future perspectives of BMTE for in vitro disease models, BM regeneration and large scale ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells for transplantation and therapy are explained. We conclude by overviewing the clinical application of biomaterials in BM and HC pathophysiology and its challenges and opportunities.	
30936566        	Specification of positional identity in forebrain organoids.            	Human brain organoids generated with current technologies recapitulate histological features of the human brain, but they lack a reproducible topographic organization. During development, spatial topography is determined by gradients of signaling molecules released from discrete signaling centers. We hypothesized that introduction of a signaling center into forebrain organoids would specify the positional identity of neural tissue in a distance-dependent manner. Here, we present a system to trigger a Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein gradient in developing forebrain organoids that enables ordered self-organization along dorso-ventral and antero-posterior positional axes. SHH-patterned forebrain organoids establish major forebrain subdivisions that are positioned with in vivo-like topography. Consistent with its behavior in vivo, SHH exhibits long-range signaling activity in organoids. Finally, we use SHH-patterned cerebral organoids as a tool to study the role of cholesterol metabolism in SHH signaling. Together, this work identifies inductive signaling as an effective organizing strategy to recapitulate in vivo-like topography in human brain organoids.	
29276469        	Using 3D Organoid Cultures to Model Intestinal Physiology and Colorectal Cancer.            	The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the intestine is a key determinant of differentiation and function; thus, preserving this architecture is an important consideration for studies of intestinal homeostasis and disease. Over the past decade, a number of systems for 3D intestinal organoid cultures have been developed and adapted to model a wide variety of biological phenomenon.                We discuss the current state of intestinal and colorectal cancer (CRC) 3D modeling, the most common methods for generating organoid cultures, and how these have yielded insights into intestinal physiology and tumor biology.                Organoids have been used to model numerous aspects of intestinal physiology and disease. Recent adaptations have further improved disease modeling and high-throughput therapeutic screening.                These studies show intestinal organoid models are a robust, highly tractable system which maintains many vital features of intestinal tissue, making them a pivotal step forward in the field of gastroenterology.	
31231611        	Pancreatic Cancer Organoids for Determining Sensitivity to Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal Inhibitors (BETi).            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a heterogeneous disease, therefore stratification of patients is essential to predict their responses to therapies and to choose the best treatment. PDAC-derived organoids were produced from PDTX and Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsies. A signature based on 16 genes targets of the c-MYC oncogene was applied to classify samples into two sub-groups with distinctive phenotypes named MYC-high and MYC-low. The analysis of 9 PDTXs and the corresponding derived organoids revealed that this signature which was previously designed from PDTX is transferable to the organoid model. Primary organoids from 24 PDAC patients were treated with NHWD-870 or JQ1, two inhibitors of c-MYC transcription. Notably, the comparison of their effect between the two sub-groups showed that both compounds are more efficient in MYC-high than in MYC-low samples, being NHWD-870 the more potent treatment. In conclusion, this study shows that the molecular signatures could be applied to organoids obtained directly from PDAC patients to predict the treatment response and could help to take the more appropriate therapeutic decision for each patient in a clinical timeframe.	
30401811        	Reversal of proliferation deficits caused by chromosome 16p13.11 microduplication through targeting NFκB signaling: an integrated study of patient-derived neuronal precursor cells, cerebral organoids and in vivo brain imaging.            	The molecular basis of how chromosome 16p13.11 microduplication leads to major psychiatric disorders is unknown. Here we have undertaken brain imaging of patients carrying microduplications in chromosome 16p13.11 and unaffected family controls, in parallel with iPS cell-derived cerebral organoid studies of the same patients. Patient MRI revealed reduced cortical volume, and corresponding iPSC studies showed neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation abnormalities and reduced organoid size, with the NPCs therein displaying altered planes of cell division. Transcriptomic analyses of NPCs uncovered a deficit in the NFκB p65 pathway, confirmed by proteomics. Moreover, both pharmacological and genetic correction of this deficit rescued the proliferation abnormality. Thus, chromosome 16p13.11 microduplication disturbs the normal programme of NPC proliferation to reduce cortical thickness due to a correctable deficit in the NFκB signalling pathway. This is the first study demonstrating a biologically relevant, potentially ameliorable, signalling pathway underlying chromosome 16p13.11 microduplication syndrome in patient-derived neuronal precursor cells.	
28847686        	Obstacles in Renal Regenerative Medicine: Metabolic and Epigenetic Parallels Between Cellular Reprogramming and Kidney Cancer Oncogenesis.            	Regenerative medicine has recently presented a revolutionary solution to end-stage kidney disease. Reprogramming patients' own cells generates induced pluripotent stem cells that are subsequently differentiated to "kidney organoid," a structure that is anatomically and functionally similar to the kidney. This approach holds the promise of a transplantable, immunocompetent, and functional kidney that could be produced in vitro. However, caution must be taken due to the molecular-level similarities between induced pluripotent stem cells and renal cell carcinomas. As such, if cell reprogramming is not tightly controlled, it can lead to carcinogenic changes.                Based on recent next-generation sequencing results and other supporting data, we identified three major molecular attributes of renal cell carcinoma: metabolic alterations, epigenetic changes, and miRNA-based alterations. Strikingly, these variations are mirrored in induced pluripotent stem cells, which are the main cell source of renal regenerative medicine. Our objective was to discuss the shared metabolic, epigenetic and miRNA-regulated characteristics and to abridge their significance in renal regenerative medicine.                English-language literature was retrieved through PubMed.                Authors collected the published evidence and evaluated the content based on independent literature findings. Articles were filtered to include only highly relevant, recent publications that presented reproducible results by authorities of the field.                The kidney represents a unique metabolic environment that could be hijacked by induced pluripotent stem cells or by partially differentiated cells for oncogenic transformation. Future differentiation protocols must produce kidney organoids that are fully engaged in filtration function.                A new technology can produce mini-kidneys or kidney organoids. This review discusses some of the challenges this technology has to face, including its high oncogenic potential. Understanding these similarities will lead to the safe creation of new functional kidney units in patients with kidney failure.                Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier B.V.

33408713        	Stem Cells and Organoid Technology in Precision Medicine in Inflammation: Are We There Yet?            	Individualised cellular models of disease are a key tool for precision medicine to recapitulate chronic inflammatory processes. Organoid models can be derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or from primary stem cells ex vivo. These models have been emerging over the past decade and have been used to reconstruct the respective organ-specific physiology and pathology, at an unsurpassed depth. In cancer research, patient-derived cancer organoids opened new perspectives in predicting therapy response and provided novel insights into tumour biology. In precision medicine of chronic inflammatory disorders, stem-cell based organoid models are currently being evaluated in pre-clinical pharmacodynamic studies (clinical studies in a dish) and are employed in clinical studies, e.g., by re-transplanting autologous epithelial organoids to re-establish intestinal barrier integrity. A particularly exciting feature of iPSC systems is their ability to provide insights into organ systems and inflammatory disease processes, which cannot be monitored with clinical biopsies, such as immune reactions in neurodegenerative disorders. Refinement of differentiation protocols, and next-generation co-culturing methods, aimed at generating self-organised, complex tissues in vitro, will be the next logical steps. In this mini-review, we critically discuss the current state-of-the-art stem cell and organoid technologies, as well as their future impact, potential and promises in combating immune-mediated chronic diseases.

30552408        	Isolation of Biopsy-Derived, Human Cervical Keratinocytes Propagated as Monolayer and Organoid Cultures.            	The successful isolation and propagation of patient-derived keratinocytes from cervical lesions constitute a more appropriate model of cervical disease than traditional cervical cancer-derived cell lines such as SiHa and CaSki. Our aim was to streamline the growth of patient-obtained, cervical keratinocytes into a reproducible process. We performed an observational case series study with 60 women referred to colposcopy for a diagnostic biopsy. Main outcome measures were how many samples could be passaged at least once (n = 11), and where enough cells could be established, to precisely define their proliferation profile over time (n = 3). Altering cell culture conditions over those reported by other groups markedly improved outcomes. We were also successful in making freeze backs which could be resuscitated to successfully propagate multi-layered, organoids from cervical keratinocytes (n = 3). For best results, biopsy-intrinsic factors such as size and tissue digestion appear to be major variables. This seems to be the first systematic report with a well characterized and defined sample size, detailed protocol, and carefully assessed cell yield and performance. This research is particularly impactful for constituting a sample repository-on-demand for appropriate disease modelling and drug screening under the umbrella of personalized health.

31070828        	New frontiers in modeling tuberous sclerosis with human stem cell-derived neurons and brain organoids.            	Recent advances in human stem cell and genome engineering have enabled the generation of genetically defined human cellular models for brain disorders. These models can be established from a patient's own cells and can be genetically engineered to generate isogenic, controlled systems for mechanistic studies. Given the challenges of obtaining and working with primary human brain tissue, these models fill a critical gap in our understanding of normal and abnormal human brain development and provide an important complement to animal models. Recently, there has been major progress in modeling the neuropathophysiology of the canonical "mTORopathy" tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) with such approaches. Studies using two- and three-dimensional cultures of human neurons and glia have provided new insights into how mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes impact human neural development and function. Here we discuss recent progress in human stem cell-based modeling of TSC and highlight challenges and opportunities for further efforts in this area.                © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Intestinal organoids grown from adult stem cells have emerged as prototype 3D organotypic models for studying tissue renewal and homeostasis. Owing to their strict dependence on Wnt signaling, intestinal organoids offer an unprecedented opportunity to examine Wnt pathway regulation in normal physiology and cancer. We review how alterations in growth factor dependency and organoid morphology can be exploited to identify Wnt signaling mechanisms, characterize mutated pathway components, and predict responses of patient-derived tumors to targeted therapy. We discuss current deficits in the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships that are to be considered when interpreting mutation-induced changes in organoid morphology.

32411709        	Organoid-Transplant Model Systems to Study the Effects of Obesity on the Pancreatic Carcinogenesis in vivo.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality among adults in developed countries. The discovery of the most common genetic alterations as well as the development of organoid models of pancreatic cancer have provided insight into the fundamental pathways driving tumor progression from a normal cell to non-invasive precursor lesion and finally to widely metastatic disease, offering new opportunities for identifying the key driver of cancer evolution. Obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Several epidemiological studies have shown the positive association between obesity and cancer-related morbidity/mortality, as well as poorer prognosis and treatment outcome. Despite strong evidence indicates a link between obesity and cancer incidence, the molecular basis of the initiating events remains largely elusive. This is mainly due to the lack of an accurate and reliable model of pancreatic carcinogenesis that mimics human obesity-associated PDAC, making data interpretation difficult and often confusing. Here we propose a feasible and manageable organoid-based preclinical tool to study the effects of obesity on pancreatic carcinogenesis. Therefore, we tracked the effects of obesity on the natural evolution of PDAC in a genetically defined transplantable model of the syngeneic murine pancreatic preneoplastic lesion (mP) and tumor (mT) derived-organoids that recapitulates the progression of human disease from early preinvasive lesions to metastatic disease. Our results suggest that organoid-derived transplant in obese mice represents a suitable system to study early steps of pancreatic carcinogenesis and supports the hypothesis that inflammation induced by obesity stimulates tumor progression and metastatization during pancreatic carcinogenesis.

33173975        	Butyrate enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy via FOXO3A in colorectal cancer patient‑derived organoids.            	Enhancing the radioresponsiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) is essential for local control and prognosis. However, consequent damage to surrounding healthy cells can lead to treatment failure. We hypothesized that short‑chain fatty acids (SCFAs) could act as radiosensitizers for cancer cells, allowing the administration of a lower and safer dose of radiation. To test this hypothesis, the responses of three‑dimensional‑cultured organoids, derived from CRC patients, to radiotherapy, as well as the effects of combined radiotherapy with the SCFAs butyrate, propionate and acetate as candidate radiosensitizers, were evaluated via reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and organoid viability assay. Of the three SCFAs tested, only butyrate suppressed the proliferation of the organoids. Moreover, butyrate significantly enhanced radiation‑induced cell death and enhanced treatment effects compared with administration of radiation alone. The radiation‑butyrate combination reduced the proportion of Ki‑67 (proliferation marker)‑positive cells and decreased the number of S phase cells via FOXO3A. Meanwhile, 3/8 CRC organoids were found to be non‑responsive to butyrate with lower expression levels of FOXO3A compared with the responsive cases. Notably, butyrate did not increase radiation‑induced cell death and improved regeneration capacity after irradiation in normal organoids. These results suggest that butyrate could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy while protecting the normal mucosa, thus highlighting a potential strategy for minimizing the associated toxicity of radiotherapy.	
26395140        	Modeling mouse and human development using organoid cultures.            	In vitro three-dimensional (3D) cultures are emerging as novel systems with which to study tissue development, organogenesis and stem cell behavior ex vivo. When grown in a 3D environment, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) self-organize into organoids and acquire the right tissue patterning to develop into several endoderm- and ectoderm-derived tissues, mimicking their in vivo counterparts. Tissue-resident adult stem cells (AdSCs) also form organoids when grown in 3D and can be propagated in vitro for long periods of time. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in the generation of pluripotent stem cell- and AdSC-derived organoids, highlighting their potential for enhancing our understanding of human development. We will also explore how this new culture system allows disease modeling and gene repair for a personalized regenerative medicine approach.                 © 2015.

Patient-derived cancer organoids hold great potential to accurately model and predict therapeutic responses. Efficient organoid isolation methods that minimize post-collection manipulation of tissues would improve adaptability, accuracy, and applicability to both experimental and real-time clinical settings. Here we present a simple and minimally invasive fine-needle aspiration (FNA)-based organoid culture technique using a variety of tumor types including gastrointestinal, thyroid, melanoma, and kidney. This method isolates organoids directly from patients at the bedside or from resected tissues, requiring minimal tissue processing while preserving the histologic growth patterns and infiltrating immune cells. Finally, we illustrate diverse downstream applications of this technique including in vitro high-throughput chemotherapeutic screens, in situ immune cell characterization, and in vivo patient-derived xenografts. Thus, routine clinical FNA-based collection techniques represent an unappreciated substantial source of material that can be exploited to generate tumor organoids from a variety of tumor types for both discovery and clinical applications.

32294323        	Generation and Characterization of Patient-Derived Head and Neck, Oral, and Esophageal Cancer Organoids.            	Esophageal cancers comprise adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, two distinct histologic subtypes. Both are difficult to treat and among the deadliest human malignancies. We describe protocols to initiate, grow, passage, and characterize patient-derived organoids (PDO) of esophageal cancers, as well as squamous cell carcinomas of oral/head-and-neck and anal origin. Formed rapidly (<14 days) from a single-cell suspension embedded in basement membrane matrix, esophageal cancer PDO recapitulate the histology of the original tumors. Additionally, we provide guidelines for morphological analyses and drug testing coupled with functional assessment of cell response to conventional chemotherapeutics and other pharmacological agents in concert with emerging automated imaging platforms. Predicting drug sensitivity and potential therapy resistance mechanisms in a moderate-to-high throughput manner, esophageal cancer PDO are highly translatable in personalized medicine for customized esophageal cancer treatments. © 2020 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

26828484        	Lingual Epithelial Stem Cells and Organoid Culture of Them.            	As tongue cancer is one of the major malignant cancers in the world, understanding the mechanism of maintenance of lingual epithelial tissue, which is known to be the origin of tongue cancer, is unquestionably important. However, the actual stem cells that are responsible for the long-term maintenance of the lingual epithelium have not been identified. Moreover, a simple and convenient culture method for lingual epithelial stem cells has not yet been established. Recently, we have shown that Bmi1-positive cells, residing at the second or third layer of the epithelial cell layer at the base of the interpapillary pit (IPP), were slow-cycling and could supply keratinized epithelial cells for over one year, indicating that Bmi1-positive cells are long-term lingual epithelial stem cells. In addition, we have developed a novel lingual epithelium organoid culture system using a three-dimensional matrix and growth factors. Here, we discuss current progress in the identification of lingual stem cells and future applications of the lingual culture system for studying the regulatory mechanisms of the lingual epithelium and for regenerative medicine.	
25706875        	Modeling colorectal cancer using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated engineering of human intestinal organoids.            	Human colorectal tumors bear recurrent mutations in genes encoding proteins operative in the WNT, MAPK, TGF-β, TP53 and PI3K pathways. Although these pathways influence intestinal stem cell niche signaling, the extent to which mutations in these pathways contribute to human colorectal carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here we use the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing system to introduce multiple such mutations into organoids derived from normal human intestinal epithelium. By modulating the culture conditions to mimic that of the intestinal niche, we selected isogenic organoids harboring mutations in the tumor suppressor genes APC, SMAD4 and TP53, and in the oncogenes KRAS and/or PIK3CA. Organoids engineered to express all five mutations grew independently of niche factors in vitro, and they formed tumors after implantation under the kidney subcapsule in mice. Although they formed micrometastases containing dormant tumor-initiating cells after injection into the spleen of mice, they failed to colonize in the liver. In contrast, engineered organoids derived from chromosome-instable human adenomas formed macrometastatic colonies. These results suggest that 'driver' pathway mutations enable stem cell maintenance in the hostile tumor microenvironment, but that additional molecular lesions are required for invasive behavior.

32898601        	Differentiated cancer cell-originated lactate promotes the self-renewal of cancer stem cells in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids.            	Tumors harbor diverse compartments of cells with distinct metabolic properties and phenotypes, but the mechanism by which metabolic commensalism among distinct subsets of cancer cells affects tumor progression remains unclear. Colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported to consist of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and differentiated cancer cells (non-CSCs). In the present study, organoid models were employed to show that CSCs and non-CSCs in CRC were characterized by distinct metabolic phenotypes. Treatment with either non-CSC-derived conditioned medium or exogenous lactate enhanced organoid-forming and tumor-initiating capacity of CSCs. In tumor regeneration assays with co-implanted CSCs and non-CSCs, the tumor-initiating activity was reduced when either monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4 in non-CSCs or MCT1 in CSCs was silenced or inhibited. Mechanistically, oxiadative phosphorylation-derived reactive oxygen species in CSCs activated AKT-Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which could be induced by lactate from non-CSCs. Overall, these results suggest that CSCs and non-CSCs possess distinct metabolic profiles and, unexpectedly, non-CSC-originated lactate promotes self-renewal of CSCs and thus contributes to CRC progression. Our findings establish a rationale for developing novel therapies targeting the metabolic commensalism between different cell populations in CRC.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

28132888        	Differentiation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells to Mammary-like Organoids.            	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can give rise to multiple cell types and hold great promise in regenerative medicine and disease-modeling applications. We have developed a reliable two-step protocol to generate human mammary-like organoids from iPSCs. Non-neural ectoderm-cell-containing spheres, referred to as mEBs, were first differentiated and enriched from iPSCs using MammoCult medium. Gene expression profile analysis suggested that mammary gland function-associated signaling pathways were hallmarks of 10-day differentiated mEBs. We then generated mammary-like organoids from 10-day mEBs using 3D floating mixed gel culture and a three-stage differentiation procedure. These organoids expressed common breast tissue, luminal, and basal markers, including estrogen receptor, and could be induced to produce milk protein. These results demonstrate that human iPSCs can be directed in vitro toward mammary lineage differentiation. Our findings provide an iPSC-based model for studying regulation of normal mammary cell fate and function as well as breast disease development.                Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

33135109        	Organoid based personalized medicine: from bench to bedside.            	Three-dimensional cultured organoids have become a powerful in vitro research tool that preserves genetic, phenotypic and behavioral trait of in vivo organs, which can be established from both pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells. Organoids derived from adult stem cells can be established directly from diseased epithelium and matched normal tissues, and organoids can also be genetically manipulated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Applications of organoids in basic research involve the modeling of human development and diseases, including genetic, infectious and malignant diseases. Importantly, accumulating evidence suggests that biobanks of patient-derived organoids for many cancers and cystic fibrosis have great value for drug development and personalized medicine. In addition, organoids hold promise for regenerative medicine. In the present review, we discuss the applications of organoids in the basic and translational research.	
33532470        	Avatar acceptability: views from the Australian Cystic Fibrosis community on the use of personalised organoid technology to guide treatment decisions.            	Patient-oriented research approaches that reflect the needs and priorities of those most affected by health research outcomes improves translation of research findings into practice. Targeted therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) are now a viable treatment option for some eligible individuals despite the heterogeneous patient-specific therapeutic response. This has necessitated development of a clinical tool that predicts treatment response for individual patients. Patient-derived mini-organs (organoids) have been at the forefront of this development. However, little is known about their acceptability in CF patients and members of the public.                We used a cross-sectional observational design to conduct an online survey in people with CF, their carers and community comparisons. Acceptability was examined in five domains: 1) willingness to use organoids, 2) perceived advantages and disadvantages of organoids, 3) acceptable out-of-pocket costs, 4) turnaround time and 5) source of tissue.                In total, 188 participants completed the questionnaire, including adults with CF and parents of children with CF (90 (48%)), and adults without CF and parents of children without CF (98 (52%)). Use of organoids to guide treatment decisions in CF was acceptable to 86 (95%) CF participants and 98 (100%) community participants. The most important advantage was that organoids may improve treatment selection, improving the patient's quality of life and life expectancy. The most important disadvantage was that the organoid recommended treatment might be unavailable or too expensive.                These findings indicate acceptance of patient-derived organoids as a tool to predict treatment response by the majority of people surveyed. This may indicate successful future implementation into healthcare systems.                Copyright ©ERS 2021.	
29503086        	Renal Subcapsular Transplantation of PSC-Derived Kidney Organoids Induces Neo-vasculogenesis and Significant Glomerular and Tubular Maturation In Vivo.            	Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived kidney organoids may facilitate disease modeling and the generation of tissue for renal replacement. Long-term application, however, will require transferability between hPSC lines and significant improvements in organ maturation. A key question is whether time or a patent vasculature is required for ongoing morphogenesis. Here, we show that hPSC-derived kidney organoids, derived in fully defined medium conditions and in the absence of any exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor, develop host-derived vascularization. In vivo imaging of organoids under the kidney capsule confirms functional glomerular perfusion as well as connection to pre-existing vascular networks in the organoids. Wide-field electron microscopy demonstrates that transplantation results in formation of a glomerular basement membrane, fenestrated endothelial cells, and podocyte foot processes. Furthermore, compared with non-transplanted organoids, polarization and segmental specialization of tubular epithelium are observed. These data demonstrate that functional vascularization is required for progressive morphogenesis of human kidney organoids.                Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

31223292        	Establishment and Morphological Characterization of Patient-Derived Organoids from Breast Cancer.            	Patient-derived organoids (PDO) technology represents an emerging tool for the study of tumor biology and drug responsiveness, thus being useful to design personalized medicine approaches. Despite several studies and clinical trials are ongoing using PDO from colorectal and pancreatic cancer, only few research papers have been published exploiting PDO from breast cancer. Here, we have developed a new protocol to establish PDO from surgical and biopsy samples. Furthermore, we have set up also the methodologies adopted for culture and morphological evaluations.                Surgical and core biopsy specimens collected from 33 patients with diagnosis of breast cancer have been processed using the protocols here described obtaining PDO from cancerous and healthy mammary tissue (when available) in a quick and easy way with good yields. The more critical aspects influencing the yield were the characteristic of the tissue of origin (healthy vs tumor tissue) and the amount of material obtained after enzymatic digestion process. Success rate from healthy samples was about 20,83%, while this percentage was higher in samples from cancer tissue (i.e. 87,5%). Also the morphological characterization of breast cancer PDO by brightfield and transmission electron microscopy has been reported.                Despite obtaining some organoids from a surgical or biopsy specimen is not a difficult procedure, the establishment of a stable organoid line able to grow and replicate, suitable for long-term biobank storage, is not so obvious. A novel, simple and quick procedure to obtain PDO from surgical and biopsy samples is here proposed to achieve high success rate .	
33099835        	A simple metastatic brain cancer model using human embryonic stem cell-derived cerebral organoids.            	Every year, hundreds of thousands of people die because of metastatic brain cancer. Most metastatic cancer research uses 2D cell culture or animal models, but they have a few limitations, such as difficulty reproducing human tissue structures. This study developed a simple 3D in vitro model to better replicate brain metastasis using human cancer cells and human embryonic stem cell-derived cerebral organoids (metastatic brain cancer cerebral organoid [MBCCO]). The MBCCO model successfully reproduced metastatic cancer processes, including cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration, in addition to cell-cell interactions. Using the MBCCO model, we demonstrated that lung-specific X protein (LUNX) plays an important role in cell proliferation and migration or invasion. We also observed astrocyte accumulation around and their interaction with cancer cells through connexin 43 in the MBCCO model. We analyzed whether the MBCCO model can be used to screen drugs by measuring the effects of gefitinib, a well-known anticancer agent. We also examined the toxicity of gefitinib using normal cerebral organoids (COs). Therefore, the MBCCO model is a powerful tool for modeling human metastatic brain cancer in vitro and can also be used to screen drugs.                © 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.	
32421698        	Patient-derived oral mucosa organoids as an in vitro model for methotrexate induced toxicity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.            	We have recently established a protocol to grow wildtype human oral mucosa organoids. These three-dimensional structures can be maintained in culture long-term, do not require immortalization, and recapitulate the multilayered composition of the epithelial lining of the oral mucosa. Here, we validate the use of this model to study the effect of Leucovorin (LV) on Methotrexate (MTX)-induced toxicity. MTX is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although effective, the use of MTX often results in severe side-effects, including oral mucositis, which is characterized by epithelial cell death. Here, we show that organoids are sensitive to MTX, and that the addition of LV reduces MTX toxicity, in both a concentration- and timing-dependent manner. Additionally, we show that a 24 hour 'pretreatment' with LV reduces MTX-induced cell death, suggesting that such a pretreatment could decrease mucositis in patients. Taken together, we provide the first in vitro model to study the effect of MTX on wildtype oral mucosa cells. Our findings underscore the relevance of the clinically applied LV regimen and highlight the potential of this model to further optimize modifications in dosing and timing of Leucovorin on oral mucosa cells.	
33613198        	Organoid Models of Glioblastoma and Their Role in Drug Discovery.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating adult brain cancer with high rates of recurrence and treatment resistance. Cellular heterogeneity and extensive invasion of surrounding brain tissues are characteristic features of GBM that contribute to its intractability. Current GBM model systems do not recapitulate some of the complex features of GBM and have not produced sufficiently-effective treatments. This has cast doubt on the effectiveness of current GBM models and drug discovery paradigms. In search of alternative pre-clinical GBM models, various 3D organoid-based GBM model systems have been developed using human cells. The scalability of these systems and potential to more accurately model characteristic features of GBM, provide promising new avenues for pre-clinical GBM research and drug discovery efforts. Here, we review the current suite of organoid-GBM models, their individual strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their future applications with an emphasis on compound screening.

33572899        	Establishment and Long-Term Expansion of Small Cell Lung Cancer Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids.            	Differential chemo-sensitivity of cancer cells, which is attributed to the cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variation of cancer cells, is considered to be the main reason for tumor recurrence after chemotherapy. Here, we generated small cell lung cancer patient-derived tumor organoids and subjected them to long-term expansion with the addition of WNT3A or R-spondin1. We confirmed that the organoids have similar genetic profiles, molecular characteristics, and morphological architectures to the corresponding patient tumor tissue during and after long-term expansion. Interestingly, the cellular heterogeneity of organoids is reflected in their differential response to cisplatin or etoposide. We propose to utilize the organoids as small cell lung cancer patient avatar models that would be ideal for investigating the mechanisms underlying tumor recurrence after chemotherapy, and would ultimately help to develop personalized medicine.	
30393802        	Tumor-on-a-chip platform to investigate progression and drug sensitivity in cell lines and patient-derived organoids.            	Most cancer treatment strategies target cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and intravasation of tumor cells in an attempt to limit tumor growth and metastasis. An in vitro platform to assess tumor progression and drug sensitivity could provide avenues to enhance our understanding of tumor metastasis as well as precision medicine. We present a microfluidic platform that mimics biological mass transport near the arterial end of a capillary in the tumor microenvironment. A central feature is a quiescent perfused 3D microvascular network created prior to loading tumor cells or patient-derived tumor organoids in an adjacent compartment. The physiological delivery of nutrients and/or drugs to the tumor then occurs through the vascular network. We demonstrate the culture, growth, and treatment of tumor cell lines and patient-derived breast cancer organoids. The platform provides the opportunity to simultaneously and dynamically observe hallmark features of tumor progression including cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell migration, and tumor cell intravasation. Additionally, primary breast tumor organoids are viable in the device for several weeks and induce robust sprouting angiogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our platform for drug discovery and personalized medicine by analyzing the response to chemo- and anti-angiogenic therapy. Precision medicine-based cancer treatments can only be realized if individual tumors can be rapidly assessed for therapeutic sensitivity in a clinically relevant timeframe (⪅14 days). Our platform indicates that this goal can be achieved and provides compelling opportunities to advance precision medicine for cancer.

33582211        	Non-matrigel scaffolds for organoid cultures.            	Organoids are three-dimensional cell cultures mostly from tissue-resident or embryonic stem cells (one or multiple) on hydrogels along with defined growth factors. Currently, matrigel is the most commonly employed matrix for 3D organoid cultures. However, certain undesirable attributes of matrigel have paved the way for several other natural and synthetic hydrogel scaffolds for organoid cultures. In this review, we discuss the constraints of matrigel and describe other alternative scaffolds that have been used for organoid cultures. Given the potential of organoids in a plethora of therapeutic and pharmaceutical applications, it is indeed imperative to develop defined and customized hydrogels other than the matrigel.

27060462        	Measurement of Rhodamine 123 in Three-Dimensional Organoids: A Novel Model for P-Glycoprotein Inhibitor Screening.            	P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as the most important efflux transporter in intestines, plays the key role to determine the bioavailability of many drugs. The three-dimensional (3D) organoid model is suitable to imitate small intestinal epithelium. In this study, a rapid, sensitive and efficient method to measure rhodamine 123 (Rh123, P-gp substrate) in 3D organoids was developed to analyse P-gp-mediated drug transport. Ultrasonic cell disruptor was used to smash the organoid, and automatic microplate reader was used for detecting the concentration of Rh123 (λex /λem = 485/520 nm). Moreover, verapamil, quinidine and mitotane were used to make validation about this newly developed approach. All three P-gp inhibitors significantly inhibited the transport of Rh123 into 3D organoids. Therefore, the above-mentioned method could serve as a new model for P-gp inhibitor screening in a high-throughput way.                 © 2016 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).	
31452509        	Tailored tetravalent antibodies potently and specifically activate Wnt/Frizzled pathways in cells, organoids and mice.            	Secreted Wnt proteins regulate development and adult tissue homeostasis by binding and activating cell-surface Frizzled receptors and co-receptors including LRP5/6. The hydrophobicity of Wnt proteins has complicated their purification and limited their use in basic research and as therapeutics. We describe modular tetravalent antibodies that can recruit Frizzled and LRP5/6 in a manner that phenocopies the activities of Wnts both in vitro and in vivo. The modular nature of these synthetic Frizzled and LRP5/6 Agonists, called FLAgs, enables tailored engineering of specificity for one, two or multiple members of the Frizzled family. We show that FLAgs underlie differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, sustain organoid growth, and activate stem cells in vivo. Activation of Wnt signaling circuits with tailored FLAgs will enable precise delineation of functional outcomes directed by distinct receptor combinations and could provide a new class of therapeutics to unlock the promise of regenerative medicine.                © 2019, Tao et al.	
30792186        	Human colon organoids reveal distinct physiologic and oncogenic Wnt responses.            	Constitutive Wnt activation upon loss of Adenoma polyposis coli (APC) acts as main driver of colorectal cancer (CRC). Targeting Wnt signaling has proven difficult because the pathway is crucial for homeostasis and stem cell renewal. To distinguish oncogenic from physiological Wnt activity, we have performed transcriptome and proteome profiling in isogenic human colon organoids. Culture in the presence or absence of exogenous ligand allowed us to discriminate receptor-mediated signaling from the effects of CRISPR/Cas9-induced APC loss. We could catalog two nonoverlapping molecular signatures that were stable at distinct levels of stimulation. Newly identified markers for normal stem/progenitor cells and adenomas were validated by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. We found that oncogenic Wnt signals are associated with good prognosis in tumors of the consensus molecular subtype 2 (CMS2). In contrast, receptor-mediated signaling was linked to CMS4 tumors and poor prognosis. Together, our data represent a valuable resource for biomarkers that allow more precise stratification of Wnt responses in CRC.                © 2019 Michels et al.

32654505        	Organoid model of urothelial cancer: establishment and applications for bladder cancer research.            	3D cancer cell models are suitable for drug evaluation because they more precisely mimic tissue architecture than 2D cultures. To study cytotoxicity of anticancer agents, the most sensitive CellTiter-Glo 3D assay is used. However, this is an end point assay, so it is not possible to consider the variance of the starting material amount in the final reading. It is difficult to maintain an even plating density of 3D organoids for cytotoxicity analysis. We present a simple, 3D bladder cancer culture that can be maintained, cryopreserved and used for molecular and drug response studies. We applied a simple modification of the drug response assay for 3D cultures by measuring the background signal with the CellTiter Blue assay before drug application.	
30948332        	What gastroenterologists and hepatologists should know about organoids in 2019.            	Most of the research behind new medical advances is carried out using either animal models or cancer cells, which both have their disadvantage in particular with regard to medical applications such as personalized medicine and novel therapeutic approaches. However, recent advances in stem cell biology have enabled long-term culturing of organotypic intestinal or hepatic tissues derived from tissue resident or pluripotent stem cells. These 3D structures, denoted as organoids, represent a substantial advance in structural and functional complexity over traditional in vitro cell culture models that are often non-physiological and transformed. They can recapitulate the in vivo architecture, functionality and genetic signature of the corresponding tissue. The opportunity to model epithelial cell biology, epithelial turnover, barrier dynamics, immune-epithelial communication and host-microbe interaction more efficiently than previous culture systems, greatly enhance the translational potential of organotypic hepato-gastrointestinal culture systems. Thus there is increasing interest in using such cultured cells as a source for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and personalized medicine. This review will highlight some of the established and also some exciting novel perspectives on organoids in the fields of gastroenterology and hepatology.                Copyright © 2019.

32432209        	Bioengineered Tumor Organoids.            	Recent advances in biofabrication technologies, such as cell culture systems, and biomaterials have led to the development of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture platforms, such as tumor organoids. Tumor organoids are more physiologically accurate to the in vivo system, which they are intended to model, compared with traditional 2D cancer cell culture systems. Tumor organoids can mimic pathological and physical characteristics of tumors as well as maintain genetic stability of the cancer cells. Furthermore tumor organoids have advantage over animal models, being made from human cells and easily controlled in the laboratory to attain the desired tissue characteristics. In this section, we describe general tumor organoid technologies, the importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in model culture systems, and the use of tumor organoids in drug development and precision medicine. Organoid technologies continue to develop rapidly for applications in academic, clinical, and pharmaceutical settings.	
26436704        	Mini-gut organoids: reconstitution of the stem cell niche.            	In the adult mammalian body, self-renewal of tissue stem cells is regulated by extracellular niche environments in response to the demands of tissue organization. Intestinal stem cells expressing Lgr5 constantly self-renew in their specific niche at the crypt bottom to maintain rapid turnover of the epithelium. Niche-regulated stem cell self-renewal is perturbed in several mouse genetic models and during human tumorigenesis, suggesting roles for EGF, Wnt, BMP/TGF-β, and Notch signaling. In vitro niche reconstitution capitalizing on this knowledge has enabled the growth of single intestinal stem cells into mini-gut epithelial organoids comprising Lgr5(+) stem cells and all types of differentiated lineages. The mini-gut organoid culture platform is applicable to various types of digestive tissue epithelium from multiple species. The mechanism of self-renewal in organoids provides novel insights for organogenesis, regenerative medicine, and tumorigenesis of the digestive system.	
28634938        	3D Coculture of Mammary Organoids with Fibrospheres: A Model for Studying Epithelial-Stromal Interactions During Mammary Branching Morphogenesis.            	Mammary gland is composed of branched epithelial structure embedded within a complex stroma formed by several stromal cell types, including fibroblasts, and extracellular matrix (ECM). Development of mammary gland is tightly regulated by bidirectional epithelial-stromal interactions that include paracrine signaling, ECM remodeling and mechanosensing. Importantly, these interactions play crucial role in mammary gland homeostasis and when deregulated they contribute to tumorigenesis. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying epithelial-stromal interactions is critical for elucidating regulation of normal mammary gland development and homeostasis and revealing novel strategies for breast cancer therapy. To this end, several three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models have been developed to study these interactions in vitro. In this chapter, a novel 3D organoid-fibrosphere coculture model of mammary gland is described with the capacity for studying not only the qualitative and quantitative aspects of interactions between mammary fibroblasts and epithelial organoids but also their radius and directionality.	
28648364        	Differentiation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells into Colonic Organoids via Transient Activation of BMP Signaling.            	Gastric and small intestinal organoids differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have revolutionized the study of gastrointestinal development and disease. Distal gut tissues such as cecum and colon, however, have proved considerably more challenging to derive in vitro. Here we report the differentiation of human colonic organoids (HCOs) from hPSCs. We found that BMP signaling is required to establish a posterior SATB2+ domain in developing and postnatal intestinal epithelium. Brief activation of BMP signaling is sufficient to activate a posterior HOX code and direct hPSC-derived gut tube cultures into HCOs. In vitro, HCOs express colonic markers and contained colon-specific cell populations. Following transplantation into mice, HCOs undergo morphogenesis and maturation to form tissue that exhibits molecular, cellular, and morphologic properties of human colon. Together these data show BMP-dependent patterning of human hindgut into HCOs, which will be valuable for studying diseases including colitis and colon cancer.

32889597        	Human Gastrointestinal Organoid Models for Studying Microbial Disease and Cancer.            	One of the major discoveries in stem cell research in the past decade embraces the development of "organs in a dish," also known as "organoids." Organoids are three-dimensional cellular structures derived from primary stem cells of different organ-specific cell types which are capable of self-renewal and maintenance of the parental lineages. Researchers have developed in vitro organoid models to mimic in vivo host-microbial interactions and disease. In this review, we focus on the use of gastrointestinal organoids as models of microbial disease and cancer.	
31818951        	Pancreatic cancer organoids recapitulate disease and allow personalized drug screening.            	We report the derivation of 30 patient-derived organoid lines (PDOs) from tumors arising in the pancreas and distal bile duct. PDOs recapitulate tumor histology and contain genetic alterations typical of pancreatic cancer. In vitro testing of a panel of 76 therapeutic agents revealed sensitivities currently not exploited in the clinic, and underscores the importance of personalized approaches for effective cancer treatment. The PRMT5 inhibitor EZP015556, shown to target MTAP (a gene commonly lost in pancreatic cancer)-negative tumors, was validated as such, but also appeared to constitute an effective therapy for a subset of MTAP-positive tumors. Taken together, the work presented here provides a platform to identify novel therapeutics to target pancreatic tumor cells using PDOs.	
28794468        	The miR-183 family cluster alters zinc homeostasis in benign prostate cells, organoids and prostate cancer xenografts.            	The miR-183 cluster, which is comprised of paralogous miRs-183, -96 and -182, is overexpressed in many cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa). Prior studies showed that overexpression of individual pre-miRs-182, -96 and -183 in prostate cells decreased zinc import, which is a characteristic feature of PCa tumours. Zinc is concentrated in healthy prostate 10-fold higher than any other tissue, and an >80% decrease in zinc is observed in PCa specimens. Here, we studied the effect of overexpression of the entire 4.8 kb miR-183 family cluster, including the intergenic region which contains highly conserved genomic regions, in prostate cells. This resulted in overexpression of mature miR-183 family miRs at levels that mimic cancer-related changes. Overexpression of the miR-183 cluster reduced zinc transporter and intracellular zinc levels in benign prostate cells, PCa xenografts and fresh prostate epithelial organoids. Microarray analysis of miR-183 family cluster overexpression in prostate cells showed an enrichment for cancer-related pathways including adhesion, migration and wound healing. An active secondary transcription start site was identified within the intergenic region of the miR-183 cluster, which may regulate expression of miR-182. Taken together, this study shows that physiologically relevant expression of the miR-183 family regulates zinc levels and carcinogenic pathways in prostate cells.	
23951338        	Basement membrane-rich organoids with functional human blood vessels are permissive niches for human breast cancer metastasis.            	Metastatic breast cancer is the leading cause of death by malignancy in women worldwide. Tumor metastasis is a multistep process encompassing local invasion of cancer cells at primary tumor site, intravasation into the blood vessel, survival in systemic circulation, and extravasation across the endothelium to metastasize at a secondary site. However, only a small percentage of circulating cancer cells initiate metastatic colonies. This fact, together with the inaccessibility and structural complexity of target tissues has hampered the study of the later steps in cancer metastasis. In addition, most data are derived from in vivo models where critical steps such as intravasation/extravasation of human cancer cells are mediated by murine endothelial cells. Here, we developed a new mouse model to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying late steps of the metastatic cascade. We have shown that a network of functional human blood vessels can be formed by co-implantation of human endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells, embedded within a reconstituted basement membrane-like matrix and inoculated subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice. The ability of circulating cancer cells to colonize these human vascularized organoids was next assessed in an orthotopic model of human breast cancer by bioluminescent imaging, molecular techniques and immunohistological analysis. We demonstrate that disseminated human breast cancer cells efficiently colonize organoids containing a functional microvessel network composed of human endothelial cells, connected to the mouse circulatory system. Human breast cancer cells could be clearly detected at different stages of the metastatic process: initial arrest in the human microvasculature, extravasation, and growth into avascular micrometastases. This new mouse model may help us to map the extravasation process with unprecedented detail, opening the way for the identification of relevant targets for therapeutic intervention.	
31684200        	Generation of Organized Porcine Testicular Organoids in Solubilized Hydrogels from Decellularized Extracellular Matrix.            	Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue (ITT) prior to chemo/radiotherapy is now ethically accepted and is currently the only way to preserve fertility of prepubertal boys about to undergo cancer therapies. So far, three-dimensional culture of testicular cells isolated from prepubertal human testicular tissue was neither efficient nor reproducible to obtain mature spermatozoa, and ITT transplantation is not a safe option when there is a risk of cancer cell contamination of the testis. Hence, generation of testicular organoids (TOs) after cell selection is a novel strategy aimed at restoring fertility in these patients. Here, we created TOs using hydrogels developed from decellularized porcine ITT and compared cell numbers, organization and function to TOs generated in collagen only hydrogel. Organotypic culture of porcine ITT was used as a control. Rheological and mass spectrometry analyses of both hydrogels highlighted differences in terms of extracellular matrix stiffness and composition, respectively. Sertoli cells (SCs) and germ cells (GCs) assembled into seminiferous tubule-like structures delimited by a basement membrane while Leydig cells (LCs) and peritubular cells localized outside. TOs were maintained for 45 days in culture and secreted stem cell factor and testosterone demonstrating functionality of SCs and LCs, respectively. In both TOs GC numbers decreased and SC numbers increased. However, LC numbers decreased significantly in the collagen hydrogel TOs (p < 0.05) suggesting a better preservation of growth factors within TOs developed from decellularized ITT and thus a better potential to restore the reproductive capacity.	
33126085        	5-Aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic activity in patient-derived cholangiocarcinoma organoids.            	Accurate diagnosis of the disease extension of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is often difficult in clinical practice. The diagnostic yield of conventional pre-operative imaging or endoscopic procedures is sometimes insufficient for the evaluation of longitudinal spreading of CCA. Here we investigated the usefulness of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) for the pre- or intra-operative diagnosis of CCA, using patient-derived organoids.                Four CCA- and two adjacent tissue-derived organoids were established. After 5-ALA treatment, we assessed their photodynamic activity using fluorescence microscopy.                CCA organoids established from different patients showed diverse morphology in contrast to monolayer structures of non-tumor organoids, and had the ability to form subcutaneous tumors in immunodeficient mice. CCA organoids demonstrated remarkably high photodynamic activity based on higher accumulation of protoporphyrin IX as a metabolite of 5-ALA compared to non-tumor organoids (40-71% vs. < 4%, respectively). Importantly, cancer cell-specific high photodynamic activity distinguished the organoids originated from biliary stenotic lesions from those of non-stenotic lesions in a CCA patient. The high photodynamic activity did not depend on the expression profile of heme biosynthesis genes.                Distinct 5-ALA-based photodynamic activity could have diagnostic potential for the discrimination of CCA from non-tumor tissues.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	
32014099        	[Organoids from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma].            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a rapidly evolving and most frequently fatal disease. Despite the enormous progress in understanding the mechanisms related to PDAC pathogenesis, the impact on patient management has not yet been possible. Pancreatic organoids can be generated from small amounts of tissue. One of the most promising applications of organoids is that they can serve as a platform for selecting the right drugs for each patient. This approach has the potential to identify individual therapeutic vulnerabilities by allowing the personalization of treatments. However, these analyzes require several weeks before obtaining enough organoids from the same individual, to carry out the tests with several drugs, and to analyze the results, which limits its use in current clinical practice for the patients with a PDAC, whose it must be remembered that half die within 6 months of diagnosis. To overcome this obstacle, we assessed the ability of transcriptomic molecular signatures to identify patients with a particular sensitivity profile to a given treatment. The approaches based on transcriptomic profiling have the enormous advantage of using very little biological material and thus significantly reducing the time to arrive at the selection of more effective drugs to each patient.                © 2020 médecine/sciences – Inserm.	
32084388        	CRISPR-Based Adenine Editors Correct Nonsense Mutations in a Cystic Fibrosis Organoid Biobank.            	Adenine base editing (ABE) enables enzymatic conversion from A-T into G-C base pairs. ABE holds promise for clinical application, as it does not depend on the introduction of double-strand breaks, contrary to conventional CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering. Here, we describe a cystic fibrosis (CF) intestinal organoid biobank, representing 664 patients, of which ~20% can theoretically be repaired by ABE. We apply SpCas9-ABE (PAM recognition sequence: NGG) and xCas9-ABE (PAM recognition sequence: NGN) on four selected CF organoid samples. Genetic and functional repair was obtained in all four cases, while whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of corrected lines of two patients did not detect off-target mutations. These observations exemplify the value of large, patient-derived organoid biobanks representing hereditary disease and indicate that ABE may be safely applied in human cells.

31636494        	Drug discovery in psychopharmacology: from 2D models to cerebral organoids .            	Psychiatric disorders are a heterogeneous group of mental illnesses associated with a high social and economic burden on patients and society. The complex symptomatology of these disorders, coupled with our limited understanding of the structural and functional abnormalities affecting the brains of neuropsychiatric patients, has made it difficult to develop effective medical treatment strategies. With the advent of reprogramming technologies and recent developments in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-based protocols for differentiation into defined neuronal cultures and 3-dimensional cerebral organoids, a new era of preclinical disease modeling has begun which could revolutionize drug discovery in psychiatry. This review provides an overview of iPS cell-based disease models in psychiatry and how these models contribute to our understanding of pharmacological drug action. We also propose a refined iPSC-based drug discovery pipeline, ranging from cell-based stratification of patients through improved screening and validation steps to more precise psychopharmacology. .                © 2019, AICH – Servier Group﻿Copyright © 2019 AICH – Servier Group.

28949254        	A novel biosensor based on intestinal 3D organoids for detecting the function of BCRP.            	Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), a key drug efflux transporter, significantly affects the therapeutic efficacy of many drugs. Thus, screening specific BCRP inhibitors and distinguishing between substrates and non-substrates of BCRP are valuable in drug discovery and development. This study presents a novel BCRP biosensor based on intestinal 3D organoids for rapid and sensitive detection of BCRP function. First, the crypts were isolated from mouse small intestine, and cultured in advanced DMEM/F12 medium to develop intestinal 3D organoids. Second, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that BCRP protein in the organoids presented a similar expression and physiologic position to the small intestinal epithelium. Finally, the cultured organoids were treated in BCRP fluorogenic probe substrate Hoechst 33342 with or without BCRP inhibitor Ko143 and YHO-13177. The fluorescence intensity of Hoechst 33342 released from inner of the organoids was detected by microplate reader and the concentrations were calculated. Ko143 and YHO-13177 significantly inhibited the BCRP-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport in the 3D organoids. Consequently, a rapid and efficient biosensor has been successfully established to study BCRP, especially screening BCRP inhibitors in a high-throughput way.	
30009668        	Long-Term Engraftment Promotes Differentiation of Alveolar Epithelial Cells from Human Embryonic Stem Cell Derived Lung Organoids.            	Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived 3D human lung organoids (HLOs) provide a promising model to study human lung development and disease. HLOs containing proximal or/and immature distal airway epithelial cells have been successfully generated in vitro, such as early staged alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells (SPC+/SOX9+) and immature alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells (HOPX+/SOX9+). When HLOs were transplanted into immunocompromised mice for further differentiation in vivo, only few distal epithelial cells could be observed. In this study, we transplanted different stages of HLOs into immunocompromised mice to assess whether HLOs could expand and mature in vivo. We found that short-term transplanted HLOs contained lung progenitor cells (NKX2.1+, SOX9+, and P63+), but not SPC+ AT2 cells or AQP5+ AT1 cells. Meanwhile, long-term engrafted HLOs could differentiate into lung distal bipotent progenitor cells (PDPN+/SPC+/SOX9+), AT2 cells (SPC+, SPB+), and immature AT1 cells (PDPN+, AQP5-). However, HLOs at late in vitro stage turned into mature AT1-like cells (AQP5+/SPB-/SOX9-) in vivo. Immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that transplanted HLOs contained mesenchymal cells (collagen I+), vasculature (ACTA2+), neuroendocrine-like cells (PGP9.5+), and nerve fiber structures (myelin sheath structure). Together, these data reveal that hESC-derived HLOs would be useful for human lung development modeling, and transplanted HLOs could mimic lung organ-like structures in vivo by possessing vascular network and neuronal network.	
33159857        	An Organoid Biobank of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Enables Genotype-Phenotype Mapping.            	Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) that consists of neuroendocrine tumor and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a lethal but under-investigated disease owing to its rarity. To fill the scarcity of clinically relevant models of GEP-NEN, we here established 25 lines of NEN organoids and performed their comprehensive molecular characterization. GEP-NEN organoids recapitulated pathohistological and functional phenotypes of the original tumors. Whole-genome sequencing revealed frequent genetic alterations in TP53 and RB1 in GEP-NECs, and characteristic chromosome-wide loss of heterozygosity in GEP-NENs. Transcriptome analysis identified molecular subtypes that are distinguished by the expression of distinct transcription factors. GEP-NEN organoids gained independence from the stem cell niche irrespective of genetic mutations. Compound knockout of TP53 and RB1, together with overexpression of key transcription factors, conferred on the normal colonic epithelium phenotypes that are compatible with GEP-NEN biology. Altogether, our study not only provides genetic understanding of GEP-NEN, but also connects its genetics and biological phenotypes.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33223522        	Gastric organoids-an in vitro model system for the study of gastric development and road to personalized medicine.            	Gastric cancer ranks as the fifth most common human malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer related deaths. Depending on tumor stage, endoscopic or surgical resection supported by perioperative chemotherapy is the only curative option for patients. Due to late clinical manifestation and missing reliable biomarkers, early detection is challenging and overall survival remains poor. Organoids are cell aggregates cultured in three-dimensions that grow with similar characteristics as their tissue-of-origin. Due to their self-renewal and proliferative capacity, organoids can be maintained long term in culture and expanded in many cases in an unlimited fashion. Patient-derived organoid (PDO) libraries function as living biobanks, allowing the in depth analysis of tissue specific function, development and disease. The recent successful establishment of gastric cancer PDOs opens up new perspectives for multiple translational clinical applications. Here, we review different adult stem cell derived gastric organoid model systems and focus on their establishment, phenotypic and genotypic characterizations as well as their use in predicting therapy response.	
32654970        	The future of cerebral organoids in drug discovery.            	Until the discovery of human embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells, biotechnology companies were severely limited in the number of human tissues that they could model in large-scale in vitro studies. Until this point, companies have been limited to immortalized cancer lines or a small number of primary cell types that could be extracted and expanded. Nowadays, protocols continue to be developed in the stem cell field, enabling researchers to model an ever-growing library of cell types in controlled, large-scale screens. One differentiation method in particular- cerebral organoids- shows substantial potential in the field of neuroscience and developmental neurobiology. Cerebral organoid technology is still in an early phase of development, and there are several challenges that are currently being addressed by academic and industrial researchers alike. Here we briefly describe some of the early adopters of cerebral organoids, several of the challenges that they are likely facing, and various technologies that are currently being implemented to overcome them.

31138796        	Blimp1+ cells generate functional mouse sebaceous gland organoids in vitro.            	Most studies on the skin focus primarily on the hair follicle and interfollicular epidermis, whereas little is known regarding the homeostasis of the sebaceous gland (SG). The SG has been proposed to be replenished by different pools of hair follicle stem cells and cells that resides in the SG base, marked by Blimp1. Here, we demonstrate that single Blimp1+ cells isolated from mice have the potential to generate SG organoids in vitro. Mimicking SG homeostasis, the outer layer of these organoids is composed of proliferating cells that migrate inward, undergo terminal differentiation and generating lipid-filled sebocytes. Performing confocal microscopy and mass-spectrometry, we report that these organoids exhibit known markers and a lipidomic profile similar to SGs in vivo. Furthermore, we identify a role for c-Myc in sebocyte proliferation and differentiation, and determine that SG organoids can serve as a platform for studying initial stages of acne vulgaris, making this a useful platform to identify potential therapeutic targets.	
29743570        	Enterovirus 71 infection of human airway organoids reveals VP1-145 as a viral infectivity determinant.            	Human enteroviruses frequently cause severe diseases in children. Human enteroviruses are transmitted via the fecal-oral route and respiratory droplets, and primary replication occurs in the gastro-intestinal and respiratory tracts; however, how enteroviruses infect these sites is largely unknown. Human intestinal organoids have recently proven to be valuable tools for studying enterovirus-host interactions in the intestinal tract. In this study, we demonstrated the susceptibility of a newly developed human airway organoid model for enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. We showed for the first time in a human physiological model that EV71 replication kinetics are strain-dependent. A glutamine at position 145 of the VP1 capsid protein was identified as a key determinant of infectivity, and residues VP1-98K and VP1-104D were identified as potential infectivity markers. The results from this study provide new insights into EV71 infectivity in the human airway epithelia and demonstrate the value of organoid technology for virus research.	
32883331        	Modeling tumor development and metastasis using paired organoids derived from patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases.            	Tumor metastasis accounts for the majority of cancer-related deaths; it is therefore important to develop preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate disease progression. Here, we generated paired organoids derived from primary tumors and matched liver metastases in the same colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Despite the fact that paired organoids exhibit comparable gene expression and cell morphology, organoids from metastatic lesions demonstrate more aggressive phenotypes, tumorigenesis, and metastatic capacity than those from primary lesions. Transcriptional analyses of the paired organoids reveal signature genes and pathways altered during the progression of CRC, including SOX2. Further study shows that inducible knockdown of SOX2 attenuated invasion, proliferation, and liver metastasis outgrowth. Taken together, we use patient-derived paired primary and metastatic cancer organoids to model CRC metastasis and illustrate that SOX2 is associated with CRC progression and may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of CRC.	
27422270        	Organoid-on-a-chip and body-on-a-chip systems for drug screening and disease modeling.            	In recent years, advances in tissue engineering and microfabrication technologies have enabled rapid growth in the areas of in vitro organoid development as well as organoid-on-a-chip platforms. These 3D model systems often are able to mimic human physiology more accurately than traditional 2D cultures and animal models. In this review, we describe the progress that has been made to generate organ-on-a-chip platforms and, more recently, more complex multi-organoid body-on-a-chip platforms and their applications. Importantly, these systems have the potential to dramatically impact biomedical applications in the areas of drug development, drug and toxicology screening, disease modeling, and the emerging area of personalized precision medicine.

31964836        	CagA-ASPP2 complex mediates loss of cell polarity and favors H. pylori colonization of human gastric organoids.            	The main risk factor for stomach cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide, is infection with Helicobacter pylori bacterial strains that inject cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA). As the first described bacterial oncoprotein, CagA causes gastric epithelial cell transformation by promoting an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype that disrupts junctions and enhances motility and invasiveness of the infected cells. However, the mechanism by which CagA disrupts gastric epithelial cell polarity to achieve its oncogenicity is not fully understood. Here we found that the apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 2 (ASPP2), a host tumor suppressor and an important CagA target, contributes to the survival of cagA-positive H. pylori in the lumen of infected gastric organoids. Mechanistically, the CagA-ASPP2 interaction is a key event that promotes remodeling of the partitioning-defective (PAR) polarity complex and leads to loss of cell polarity of infected cells. Blockade of cagA-positive H. pylori ASPP2 signaling by inhibitors of the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling pathway-identified by a high-content imaging screen-or by a CagA-binding ASPP2 peptide, prevents the loss of cell polarity and decreases the survival of H. pylori in infected organoids. These findings suggest that maintaining the host cell-polarity barrier would reduce the detrimental consequences of infection by pathogenic bacteria, such as H. pylori, that exploit the epithelial mucosal surface to colonize the host environment.

28589925        	Mesenchymal stem cells support growth and organization of host-liver colorectal-tumor organoids and possibly resistance to chemotherapy.            	Despite having yielded extensive breakthroughs in cancer research, traditional 2D cell cultures have limitations in studying cancer progression and metastasis and screening therapeutic candidates. 3D systems can allow cells to grow, migrate, and interact with each other and the surrounding matrix, resulting in more realistic constructs. Furthermore, interactions between host tissue and developing tumors influence the susceptibility of tumors to drug treatments. Host-liver colorectal-tumor spheroids composed of primary human hepatocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and colon carcinoma HCT116 cells were created in simulated microgravity rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. The cells were seeded on hyaluronic acid-based microcarriers, loaded with liver-specific growth factors and ECM components. Only in the presence of MSC, large tumor foci rapidly formed inside the spheroids and increased in size steadily over time, while not greatly impacting albumin secretion from hepatocytes. The presence of MSC appeared to drive self-organization and formation of a stroma-like tissue surrounding the tumor foci and hepatocytes. Exposure to a commonly used chemotherapeutic 5-FU showed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity. However, if tumor organoids were allowed to mature in the RWV, they were less sensitive to the drug treatment. These data demonstrate the potential utility of liver tumor organoids for cancer progression and drug response modeling.

31956531        	Characterizing optical coherence tomography speckle fluctuation spectra of mammary organoids during suppression of intracellular motility.            	An understanding of how the mammary gland responds to toxicant and drug exposures can shed light on mechanisms of breast cancer initiation/progression and therapeutic effectiveness, respectively. In this study, we employed noninvasive, label-free and high-throughput optical coherence tomography speckle fluctuation spectroscopy (OCT-SFS) to track exposure-response relationships in three-dimensional (3D) mammary epithelial organoid models.                OCT-SFS is sensitive to relatively high speed (~0.16-8 µm/min) motions of subcellular light scattering components occurring over short (~2-114 s) time scales, termed "intracellular motility." In this study, OCT speckle fluctuation spectra are quantified by two metrics: the intracellular motility amplitude, M, and frequency-dependent motility roll-off, α. OCT-SFS was performed on human mammary organoid models comprised of pre-malignant MCF10DCIS.com cells or MCF7 adenocarcinoma cells over 6 days of exposure to either a microtubule inhibitor (Paclitaxel, Taxol) or a myosin II inhibitor (Blebbistatin). Raw values of α and M were normalized to a dynamic range corresponding to fixed (0%) and live/homeostatic (100%) organoids for each cell line.                In this work, we observed a significant decrease in both M and α of MCF10DCIS.com organoids after 24 hours of exposure to Taxol (P<0.001), and a significant decrease only in α for MCF7 organoids after 48 hours of exposure (P<0.0001). We also observed a significant decrease in both M and α of MCF7 organoids at the longest exposure time of 6 days to Blebbistatin (P<0.0001), and a significant decrease only in M for MCF10DCIS.com organoids after 24 hours of exposure (P<0.01).                OCT-SFS revealed cell line-specific response patterns, in terms of intracellular motility, to different motility suppression mechanisms. This provides a foundation for future OCT-SFS studies of longitudinal responses of the mammary gland in toxicology and drug research.                2020 Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

32460166        	Patient-derived pancreatic tumour organoids identify therapeutic responses to oncolytic adenoviruses.            	Pancreatic patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are a well-established model for studying pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) carcinogenesis and are potential predictors of clinical responses to chemotherapy. Oncolytic virotherapy is envisioned as a novel treatment modality for pancreatic cancer, and candidate viruses are being tested in clinical trials. Here, we explore the feasibility of using PDOs as a screening platform for the oncolytic adenovirus (OA) response.                Organoids were established from healthy pancreas and PDAC tissues and assessed for infectivity, oncoselectivity, and patient-dependent sensitivity to OA. Antitumour effects were studied in vivo in organoid xenografts. Further evaluation of oncolytic responses was conducted in organoids derived from orthotopic models or metastastic tissues.                Oncolytic adenoviruses display good selectivity, with replication only in organoids derived from PDAC tumours. Furthermore, responses of PDOs to a set of OAs reveal individual differences in cytotoxicity as well as in synergism with standard chemotherapy. Adenoviral cytotoxicity in PDOs is predictive of antitumour efficacy in a subcutaneous xenograft setting. Organoids from orthotopic tumours and metastases in nude mice mirror the viral preference of PDOs, indicating that PDO sensitivity to OAs could be informative about responses in both primary tumours and metastatic foci.                Our data imply that pancreatic PDOs can serve as predictive tools for screening for sensitivity to OA.                Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
31065051        	Human gut derived-organoids provide model to study gluten response and effects of microbiota-derived molecules in celiac disease.            	Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten exposure. The contribution of the adaptive immune response to CD pathogenesis has been extensively studied, but the absence of valid experimental models has hampered our understanding of the early steps leading to loss of gluten tolerance. Using intestinal organoids developed from duodenal biopsies from both non-celiac (NC) and celiac (CD) patients, we explored the contribution of gut epithelium to CD pathogenesis and the role of microbiota-derived molecules in modulating the epithelium's response to gluten. When compared to NC, RNA sequencing of CD organoids revealed significantly altered expression of genes associated with gut barrier, innate immune response, and stem cell functions. Monolayers derived from CD organoids exposed to gliadin showed increased intestinal permeability and enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to NC controls. Microbiota-derived bioproducts butyrate, lactate, and polysaccharide A improved barrier function and reduced gliadin-induced cytokine secretion. We concluded that: (1) patient-derived organoids faithfully express established and newly identified molecular signatures characteristic of CD. (2) microbiota-derived bioproducts can be used to modulate the epithelial response to gluten. Finally, we validated the use of patient-derived organoids monolayers as a novel tool for the study of CD.	
31638925        	Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) as a novel in vitro model for neuroblastoma tumours.            	Neuroblastoma (NB) is a paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system.

The lack of in vitro models able to recapitulate the intrinsic heterogeneity of primary NB tumours has hindered progress in understanding disease pathogenesis and therapy response.                Here we describe the establishment of 6 patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from cells of NB tumour biopsies capable of self-organising in a structure resembling the tissue of origin.                PDOs recapitulate the histological architecture typical of the NB tumour. Moreover, PDOs expressed NB specific markers such as neural cell adhesion molecules, NB84 antigen, synaptophysin (SYP), chromogranin A (CHGA) and neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM (CD56). Analyses of whole genome genotyping array revealed that PDOs maintained patient-specific chromosomal aberrations such as MYCN amplification, deletion of 1p and gain of chromosome 17q. Furthermore, the PDOs showed stemness features and retained cellular heterogeneity reflecting the high heterogeneity of NB tumours.                We were able to create a novel preclinical model for NB exhibiting self-renewal property and allowing to obtain a reservoir of NB patients' biological material useful for the study of NB molecular pathogenesis and to test drugs for personalised treatments.	
33452397        	Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles for photothermal ablation of colorectal cancer organoids.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment is currently hindered by micrometastatic relapse that cannot be removed completely during surgery and is often chemotherapy resistant. Targeted theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) that can produce heat for ablation and enable tumor visualization via their fluorescence offer advantages for detection and treatment of disseminated small nodules. A major hurdle in clinical translation of nanoparticles is their interaction with the 3D tumor microenvironment. To address this problem tumor organoid technology was used to evaluate the ablative potential of CD44-targeted polymer nanoparticles using hyaluronic acid (HA) as the targeting agent and coating it onto hybrid donor acceptor polymer particles (HDAPPs) to form HA-HDAPPs. Additionally, nanoparticles composed from only the photothermal polymer, poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole-4,7-diyl] (PCPDTBSe), were also coated with HA, to form HA-BSe NPs, and evaluated in 3D. Monitoring of nanoparticle transport in 3D organoids revealed uniform diffusion of non-targeted HDAPPs in comparison to attenuated diffusion of HA-HDAPPs due to nanoparticle-matrix interactions. Computational diffusion profiles suggested that HA-HDAPPs transport may not be accounted for by diffusion alone, which is indicative of nanoparticle/cell matrix interactions. Photothermal activation revealed that only HA-BSe NPs were able to significantly reduce tumor cell viability in the organoids. Despite limited transport of the CD44-targeted theranostic nanoparticles, their targeted retention provides increased heat for enhanced photothermal ablation in 3D, which is beneficial for assessing nanoparticle therapies prior to in vivo testing.	
25315765        	Metastatic tumor evolution and organoid modeling implicate TGFBR2 as a cancer driver in diffuse gastric cancer.            	Gastric cancer is the second-leading cause of global cancer deaths, with metastatic disease representing the primary cause of mortality. To identify candidate drivers involved in oncogenesis and tumor evolution, we conduct an extensive genome sequencing analysis of metastatic progression in a diffuse gastric cancer. This involves a comparison between a primary tumor from a hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome proband and its recurrence as an ovarian metastasis.                Both the primary tumor and ovarian metastasis have common biallelic loss-of-function of both the CDH1 and TP53 tumor suppressors, indicating a common genetic origin. While the primary tumor exhibits amplification of the Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene, the metastasis notably lacks FGFR2 amplification but rather possesses unique biallelic alterations of Transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2), indicating the divergent in vivo evolution of a TGFBR2-mutant metastatic clonal population in this patient. As TGFBR2 mutations have not previously been functionally validated in gastric cancer, we modeled the metastatic potential of TGFBR2 loss in a murine three-dimensional primary gastric organoid culture. The Tgfbr2 shRNA knockdown within Cdh1-/-; Tp53-/- organoids generates invasion in vitro and robust metastatic tumorigenicity in vivo, confirming Tgfbr2 metastasis suppressor activity.                We document the metastatic differentiation and genetic heterogeneity of diffuse gastric cancer and reveal the potential metastatic role of TGFBR2 loss-of-function. In support of this study, we apply a murine primary organoid culture method capable of recapitulating in vivo metastatic gastric cancer. Overall, we describe an integrated approach to identify and functionally validate putative cancer drivers involved in metastasis.	SRA                                            SRP044347
33182346        	The Organoid Era Permits the Development of New Applications to Study Glioblastoma.            	Glioblastoma (GB) is the most frequent and aggressive type of glioma. The lack of reliable GB models, together with its considerable clinical heterogeneity, has impaired a comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms that lead to tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and response to treatments. Recently, 3D cultures have opened the possibility to overcome these challenges and cerebral organoids are emerging as a leading-edge tool in GB research. The opportunity to easily engineer brain organoids via gene editing and to perform co-cultures with patient-derived tumor spheroids has enabled the analysis of cancer development in a context that better mimics brain tissue architecture. Moreover, the establishment of biobanks from GB patient-derived organoids represents a crucial starting point to improve precision medicine therapies. This review exemplifies relevant aspects of 3D models of glioblastoma, with a specific focus on organoids and their involvement in basic and translational research.	
33497645        	Three-dimensional in vitro tissue culture models of brain organoids.            	Brain organoids are three-dimensional self-assembled structures that are derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). They can recapitulate the spatiotemporal organization and function of the brain, presenting a robust system for in vitro modeling of brain development, evolution, and diseases. Significant advances in biomaterials, microscale technologies, gene editing technologies, and stem cell biology have enabled the construction of human specific brain structures in vitro. However, the limitations of long-term culture, necrosis, and hypoxic cores in different culture models obstruct brain organoid growth and survival. The in vitro models should facilitate oxygen and nutrient absorption, which is essential to generate complex organoids and provides a biomimetic microenvironment for modeling human brain organogenesis and human diseases. This review aims to highlight the progress in the culture devices of brain organoids, including dish, bioreactor, and organ-on-a-chip models. With the modulation of bioactive molecules and biomaterials, the generated organoids recapitulate the key features of the human brain in a more reproducible and hyperoxic fashion. Furthermore, an outlook for future preclinical studies and the genetic modifications of brain organoids is presented.                Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

27676432        	Organoids: Modeling Development and the Stem Cell Niche in a Dish.            	Organoids are three-dimensional in-vitro-grown cell clusters with near-native microanatomy that arise from self-organizing mammalian pluripotent or adult stem cells. Although monolayer stem cell cultures were established more than 40 years ago, organoid technology has recently emerged as an essential tool for both fundamental and biomedical research. For developmental biologists, organoids provide powerful means for ex vivo modeling of tissue morphogenesis and organogenesis. Here we discuss how organoid cultures of the intestine and other tissues have been established and how they are utilized as an in vitro model system for stem cell research and developmental biology.

31795490        	Potent Antitumor Activity of Liposomal Irinotecan in an Organoid- and CRISPR-Cas9-Based Murine Model of Gallbladder Cancer.            	Gallbladder cancer is associated with a dismal prognosis, and accurate in vivo models will be elemental to improve our understanding of this deadly disease and develop better treatment options. We have generated a transplantation-based murine model for gallbladder cancer that histologically mimics the human disease, including the development of distant metastasis. Murine gallbladder-derived organoids are genetically modified by either retroviral transduction or transfection with CRISPR/Cas9 encoding plasmids, thereby allowing the rapid generation of complex cancer genotypes. We characterize the model in the presence of two of the most frequent oncogenic drivers-Kras and ERBB2-and provide evidence that the tumor histology is highly dependent on the driver oncogene. Further, we demonstrate the utility of the model for the preclinical assessment of novel therapeutic approaches by showing that liposomal Irinotecan (Nal-IRI) is retained in tumor cells and significantly prolongs the survival of gallbladder cancer-bearing mice compared to conventional irinotecan.	
32934023        	ERG-Mediated Coregulator Complex Formation Maintains Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.            	The TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is the most common genomic rearrangement in human prostate cancer. However, in established adenocarcinoma, it is unknown how the ERG oncogene promotes a cancerous phenotype and maintains downstream androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways. In this study, we utilized a murine prostate organoid system to explore the effects of ERG on tumorigenesis and determined the mechanism underlying prostate cancer dependence on ERG. Prostate organoids lacking PTEN and overexpressing ERG (Pten-/- R26-ERG) faithfully recapitulated distinct stages of prostate cancer disease progression. In this model, deletion of ERG significantly dampened AR-dependent gene expression. While ERG was able to reprogram the AR cistrome in the process of prostate carcinogenesis, ERG knockout in established prostate cancer organoids did not drastically alter AR binding, H3K27ac enhancer, or open chromatin profiles at these reprogrammed sites. Proteomic analysis of DNA-bound AR complexes demonstrated that ERG deletion causes a loss of recruitment of critical AR coregulators and basal transcriptional machinery, including NCOA3 and RNA polymerase II, but does not alter AR binding itself. Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism of ERG oncogene addiction in prostate cancer, whereby ERG facilitates AR signaling by maintaining coregulator complexes at AR bound sites across the genome. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings exploit murine organoid models to uncover the mechanism of ERG-mediated tumorigenesis and subsequent oncogenic dependencies in prostate cancer.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31906589        	Patient-Derived Colorectal Cancer Organoids Upregulate Revival Stem Cell Marker Genes following Chemotherapeutic Treatment.            	Colorectal cancer stem cells have been proposed to drive disease progression, tumour recurrence and chemoresistance. However, studies ablating leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5)-positive stem cells have shown that they are rapidly replenished in primary tumours. Following injury in normal tissue, LGR5+ stem cells are replaced by a newly defined, transient population of revival stem cells. We investigated whether markers of the revival stem cell population are present in colorectal tumours and how this signature relates to chemoresistance. We examined the expression of different stem cell markers in a cohort of patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids and correlated expression with sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment. Our findings revealed that there was inter-tumour variability in the expression of stem cell markers. Clusterin (CLU), a marker of the revival stem cell population, was significantly enriched following 5-FU treatment and expression correlated with the level of drug resistance. Patient outcome data revealed that CLU expression is associated with both lower patient survival and an increase in disease recurrence. This suggests that CLU is a marker of drug resistance and may identify cells that drive colorectal cancer progression.	
27364469        	Organoids from adult liver and pancreas: Stem cell biology and biomedical utility.            	The liver and pancreas are critical organs maintaining whole body metabolism. Historically, the expansion of adult-derived cells from these organs in vitro has proven challenging and this in turn has hampered studies of liver and pancreas stem cell biology, as well as being a roadblock to disease modelling and cell replacement therapies for pathologies in these organs. Recently, defined culture conditions have been described which allow the in vitro culture and manipulation of adult-derived liver and pancreatic material. Here we review these systems and assess their physiological relevance, as well as their potential utility in biomedicine.                Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
25338126        	Microencapsulation of therapeutic bispecific antibodies producing cells: immunotherapeutic organoids for cancer management.            	Regardless of the important therapeutic advances developed over the last years for the management of cancer, the fact is that many patients still suffer from a tremendous reduction on their quality of life due to lack of complete selectivity of conventionally administered chemotherapeutic drugs. In the search of more efficacious tumor-targeted therapies, the use of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) capable of simultaneous binding to tumor-associated antigens and to an activating receptor, such as CD3, has emerged as a promising approach. With the intention to complementing and improving this cancer immunotherapy, human HEK-293 cells have been genetically modified ex vivo to secrete a recombinant anti-CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) × anti-CD3 bsAb. After encapsulation in alginate-poly-l-lysine microcapsules, bsAb-secreting HEK-293 cells were monitorized for several weeks. This system has proved to be feasible for the maintenance of cell growth and recombinant antibody production giving proof-of-concept of its use as immunotherapeutic organoids in cancer treatment.	
33322840        	Patient-Derived Xenograft and Organoid Models for Precision Medicine Targeting of the Tumour Microenvironment in Head and Neck Cancer.            	Patient survival from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the seventh most common cause of cancer, has not markedly improved in recent years despite the approval of targeted therapies and immunotherapy agents. Precision medicine approaches that seek to individualise therapy through the use of predictive biomarkers and stratification strategies offer opportunities to improve therapeutic success in HNSCC. To enable precision medicine of HNSCC, an understanding of the microenvironment that influences tumour growth and response to therapy is required alongside research tools that recapitulate the features of human tumours. In this review, we highlight the importance of the tumour microenvironment in HNSCC, with a focus on tumour hypoxia, and discuss the fidelity of patient-derived xenograft and organoids for modelling human HNSCC and response to therapy. We describe the benefits of patient-derived models over alternative preclinical models and their limitations in clinical relevance and how these impact their utility in precision medicine in HNSCC for the discovery of new therapeutic agents, as well as predictive biomarkers to identify patients' most likely to respond to therapy.	
28578487        	Gambogic Acid Induces Cell Apoptosis and Inhibits MAPK Pathway in PTEN-/-/p53-/- Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro and Ex Vivo.            	To investigate the effect of gambogic acid (GA) on the growth and cell death of castrate resistant prostate cancer (PC) with phosphate and tension homology (PTEN) and p53 genes deleted in vitro and ex vivo, and elucidate the underlying possible molecular mechanisms.                PTEN-/-/p53-/- PC cells and Los Angeles prostate cancer-4 (LAPC-4) cells were treated with GA for 24 h and 48 h, then cell viability was determined by cell proliferation assay. PTEN-/-/p53-/- PC cells organoids number was calculated under GA treatment for 1 week. In addition, cell titer glo assay was performed to analyze 3 dimensional cell viability of patients derived xenografts (PDX) 170.2 organoids. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptotic cells treated with GA. And confocal image was performed to detect the apoptotic mitochondrial morphological changes. Apoptotic cell death related protein levels were measured through Western blot (WB) in GA treated cells and organoids. The expression levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway related ribonucleic acid (RNAs) and proteins were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and WB, respectively.                The treatment of GA significantly reduced cell viability of PTEN-/-/p53-/- PC cells and LAPC-4 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In organoids, GA showed strong inhibition towards organoids' numbers and diameters and continuously led to a complete organoids inhibition with GA 150 nmol/L. Ex vivo results validated that GA 1 μmol/L inhibited 44.6% PDX170.2 organoids growth. As for mechanism, flow cytometry detected continuously increased apoptotic portion under GA treatment from 1.98% to 11.78% (6 h) and 29.94% (8 h, P<0.05). In addition, mitochondrial fragmentation emerged in GA treated cells indicated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway might be involved. Furthermore, WB detected caspases-3, -9 activation and light chain (LC)-3 conversion with GA treatment. WB revealed decreased activity of MAPK pathway and down-regulation of downstream c-fos oncogene RNA level was detected by RT-PCR before undergoing apoptosis (P<0.05).                GA was a potent anti-tumor compound as for PTEN-/-/p53-/- PC, which contributed to cell apoptosis via inhibition of the MAPK pathway and c-fos.	
25890569        	Re: Organoid cultures derived from patients with advanced prostate cancer.            		
31317052        	Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis identifies a putative epithelial stem cell population in human primary prostate cells in monolayer and organoid culture conditions.            	Human primary prostate epithelial (PrE) cells represent patient-derived in vitro models and are traditionally grown as a monolayer in two-dimensional culture. It has been recently demonstrated that expansion of primary cells into three-dimensional prostatic organoids better mimics prostate epithelial glands by recapitulating epithelial differentiation and cell polarity. Here, we sought to identify cell populations present in monolayer PrE cells and organoid culture, grown from the same patient, using single-cell RNA-sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a powerful tool to analyze transcriptome profiles of thousands of individual cells simultaneously, creating an in-depth atlas of cell populations within a sample. Organoids consisted of six distinct cell clusters (populations) of intermediate differentiation compared to only three clusters in the monolayer prostate epithelial cells. Integrated analysis of the datasets allowed for direct comparison of the monolayer and organoid samples and identified 10 clusters, including a distinct putative prostate stem cell population that was high in Keratin 13 (KRT13), Lymphocyte Antigen 6D (LY6D), and Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA). Many of the genes within the clusters were validated through RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence in PrE samples from 5 additional patients. KRT13+ cells were observed in discrete areas of the parent tissue and organoids. Pathway analyses and lack of EdU incorporation corroborated a stem-like phenotype based on the gene expression and quiescent state of the KRT13+ cluster. Other clusters within the samples were similar to epithelial populations reported within patient prostate tissues. In summary, these data show that the epithelial stem population is preserved in PrE cultures, with organoids uniquely expanding intermediate cell types not present in monolayer culture.	
33341445        	Unmet needs for relapsed or refractory Wilms tumour: Mapping the molecular features, exploring organoids and designing early phase trials - A collaborative SIOP-RTSG, COG and ITCC session at the first SIOPE meeting.            	Wilms tumour (WT) accounts for about 6% of all childhood cancers and overall survival of WT is about 90% in international protocols. However, for WT subgroups with much poorer prognoses, i.e. typically high-risk (unfavorable) histology and/or relapse, there is an unmet need to better understand the biology of WT and to translate biological findings into clinics through early phase clinical trials that evaluate innovative therapies. The main challenges are the small numbers of children suitable for early phase trials, the genetic heterogeneity of WT and the low number of somatic mutations that are currently considered 'druggable'. Accordingly, a joint meeting between clinical and biology experts from the international cooperative groups of the Renal Tumour Study Group of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology, the Renal Tumour Committee of the Children's Oncology Group and the European Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer consortium and parents representatives was organised during the first SIOPE meeting in Prague, 2019. We reviewed WT molecular features, ongoing/planned early phase trials and explored available knowledge on organoid technology. The key messages were: (1) relapsed WT should undergo whenever possible thorough molecular characterization and be enrolled in protocols or trials with systematic data collecting and reporting; (2) WT displays few known 'actionable' targets and currently no novel agent has appeared promising; (3) we need to improve the enrolment rate of WT candidates in early phase trials especially for the relatively small subgroup of relapses with an adverse prognostic signature; (4) despite some agnostic early phase trials existing, development of WT-focused trials are warranted; (5) growing organoids with parallel testing of drug panels seems feasible and may direct individual treatment and encourage clinical researchers to incorporate the most promising agents into early phase trials.

32086379        	Conformation-specific inhibitors of activated Ras GTPases reveal limited Ras dependency of patient-derived cancer organoids.            	The small GTPases H, K, and NRAS are molecular switches indispensable for proper regulation of cellular proliferation and growth. Several mutations in the genes encoding members of this protein family are associated with cancer and result in aberrant activation of signaling processes caused by a deregulated recruitment of downstream effector proteins. In this study, we engineered variants of the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of the C-Raf proto-oncogene, Ser/Thr kinase (CRAF). These variants bound with high affinity with the effector-binding site of Ras in an active conformation. Structural characterization disclosed how the newly identified RBD mutations cooperate and thereby enhance affinity with the effector-binding site in Ras compared with WT RBD. The engineered RBD variants closely mimicked the interaction mode of naturally occurring Ras effectors and acted as dominant-negative affinity reagents that block Ras signal transduction. Experiments with cancer cells showed that expression of these RBD variants inhibits Ras signaling, reducing cell growth and inducing apoptosis. Using these optimized RBD variants, we stratified patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids with known Ras mutational status according to their response to Ras inhibition. These results revealed that the presence of Ras mutations was insufficient to predict sensitivity to Ras inhibition, suggesting that not all of these tumors required Ras signaling for proliferation. In summary, by engineering the Ras/Raf interface of the CRAF-RBD, we identified potent and selective inhibitors of Ras in its active conformation that outcompete binding of Ras-signaling effectors.                © 2020 Wiechmann et al.

32047892        	An organoid-based carcinogenesis model induced by in vitro chemical treatment.            	Animal carcinogenesis models induced by environmental chemicals have been widely used for basic and applied cancer research. However, establishment of in vitro or ex vivo models is essential for molecular mechanistic elucidation of early events in carcinogenesis, leading to clarification of the total mode of action. In the present study, to establish an organoid-based chemical carcinogenesis model, mouse organoids were treated in vitro with 4 genotoxic chemicals, e.g. ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), acrylamide (AA), diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to examine their tumorigenicity after injection to nude mice. The four chemicals were reported to induce lung, liver or mammary carcinomas in mouse models. DMBA-treated mammary tissue-derived organoids with Trp53 heterozygous knockout exhibited tumorigenicity, but not those with wild-type Trp53, reflecting previous reports of corresponding animal models. Treatment of lung organoids with or without Trp53 knockout with EMS or AA resulted in carcinogenic histopathological characteristics, and the activation of oncogenic kinases was demonstrated in the nodules from the nude mouse subcutis. DEN-treated liver (biliary tract) organoids also had an increased number of similar changes. In conclusion, an ex vivo model for chemical carcinogenesis was established using normal mouse tissue-derived organoids. This model will be applied to detect early molecular events, leading to clarification of the mode of action of chemical carcinogenesis.                © The Author(s) 2020.

29084770        	Renal carcinoma/kidney progenitor cell chimera organoid as a novel tumorigenesis gene discovery model.            	Three-dimensional (3D) organoids provide a new way to model various diseases, including cancer. We made use of recently developed kidney-organ-primordia tissue-engineering technologies to create novel renal organoids for cancer gene discovery. We then tested whether our novel assays can be used to examine kidney cancer development. First, we identified the transcriptomic profiles of quiescent embryonic mouse metanephric mesenchyme (MM) and of MM in which the nephrogenesis program had been induced ex vivo The transcriptome profiles were then compared to the profiles of tumor biopsies from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients, and control samples from the same kidneys. Certain signature genes were identified that correlated in the developmentally induced MM and RCC, including components of the caveolar-mediated endocytosis signaling pathway. An efficient siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of Bnip3, Gsn, Lgals3, Pax8, Cav1, Egfr or Itgb2 gene expression was achieved in mouse RCC (Renca) cells. The live-cell imaging analysis revealed inhibition of cell migration and cell viability in the gene-KD Renca cells in comparison to Renca controls. Upon siRNA treatment, the transwell invasion capacity of Renca cells was also inhibited. Finally, we mixed E11.5 MM with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-expressing Renca cells to establish chimera organoids. Strikingly, we found that the Bnip3-, Cav1- and Gsn-KD Renca-YFP+ cells as a chimera with the MM in 3D organoid rescued, in part, the RCC-mediated inhibition of the nephrogenesis program during epithelial tubules formation. Altogether, our research indicates that comparing renal ontogenesis control genes to the genes involved in kidney cancer may provide new growth-associated gene screens and that 3D RCC-MM chimera organoids can serve as a novel model with which to investigate the behavioral roles of cancer cells within the context of emergent complex tissue structures.                © 2017.

25977509        	A bioassay to measure energy metabolism in mouse colonic crypts, organoids, and sorted stem cells.            	Evidence suggests that targeting cancer cell energy metabolism might be an effective therapeutic approach for selective ablation of malignancies. Using a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer, we have demonstrated that select environmental agents can alter colonic mitochondrial function by increasing respiration-induced proton leak, thereby inducing apoptosis, a marker of colon cancer risk. To further probe bioenergetics in primary intestinal cells, we developed methodology that can be modified and adapted to measure the bioenergetic profiles of colonic crypts, the basic functional unit of the colon, and colonic organoids, an ex vivo 3D culture of colonic crypts. Furthermore, in combination with the MoFlo Astrios High-Speed Cell Sorter, we were able to measure the bioenergetic profiles of colonic adult stem and daughter cells from Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creER(T2) transgenic mice. We examined the effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a full arylhydrocarbon receptor agonist, known to affect gastrointestinal function and cancer risk, on the bioenergetic profiles of intestinal epithelial cells. Mouse colonic crypts, organoids, or sorted single cells were seeded onto Matrigel-precoated Seahorse XF24 microplates for extracellular flux analysis. Temporal analyses revealed distinct energy metabolic profiles in crypts and organoids challenged with TCDD. Furthermore, sorted Lgr5(+) stem cells exhibited a Warburg-like metabolic profile. This is noteworthy because perturbations in stem cell dynamics are generally believed to represent the earliest step toward colon tumorigenesis. We propose that our innovative methodology may facilitate future in vivo/ex vivo metabolic studies using environmental agents affecting colonocyte energy metabolism.

28956107        	[Establishment of a living biobank : Improved guidance of precision cancer care with in vitro and in vivo cancer models].            	Precision oncology is a clinical approach aimed towards tailoring treatment strategies for patients based on the genetic profile of each patient's cancer. The integration of a living biobank, consisting of patient-derived tumor organoids and PDXs, with next generation sequencing approaches and high-throughput drug screening help to guide clinical decision-making and clinical trial development.                Tumor organoids derived from fresh tumor samples were used for in vitro and in vivo high-throughput drug testing.                Over a period of two years we established 56 in vitro tumor organoids and 19 in vivo xenografts from 18 different solid tumor types. Tumor morphology and molecular profiles show good concordance between the in vitro and in vivo models compared to their native tumor. High-throughput drug screening (up to 160 drugs) has been tested on eight tumor organoid lines. Seven of them underwent an additional combination drug screen. We nominated several targeted small molecules and novel combinations that have been validated in corresponding xenograft models.                This precision medicine approach outlines the integration of genomic data with drug screening from personalized preclinical cancer models to guide precision cancer care. It also fuels next generation research and has been implemented for clinical trial development.	
29917168        	Evaluation of anticancer agents using patient-derived tumor organoids characteristically similar to source tissues.            	Patient-derived tumor xenograft models represent a promising preclinical cancer model that better replicates disease, compared with traditional cell culture; however, their use is low-throughput and costly. To overcome this limitation, patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) were established from human lung, ovarian and uterine tumor tissues, among others, to accurately and efficiently recapitulate the tissue architecture and function. PDOs were able to be cultured for >6 months, and formed cell clusters with similar morphologies to their source tumors. Comparative histological and comprehensive gene expression analyses proved that the characteristics of PDOs were similar to those of their source tumors, even following long-term expansion in culture. At present, 53 PDOs have been established by the Fukushima Translational Research Project, and were designated as Fukushima PDOs (F‑PDOs). In addition, the in vivo tumorigenesis of certain F‑PDOs was confirmed using a xenograft model. The present study represents a detailed analysis of three F‑PDOs (termed REME9, 11 and 16) established from endometrial cancer tissues. These were used for cell growth inhibition experiments using anticancer agents. A suitable high-throughput assay system, with 96- or 384‑well plates, was designed for each F‑PDO, and the efficacy of the anticancer agents was subsequently evaluated. REME9 and 11 exhibited distinct responses and increased resistance to the drugs, as compared with conventional cancer cell lines (AN3 CA and RL95-2). REME9 and 11, which were established from tumors that originated in patients who did not respond to paclitaxel and carboplatin (the standard chemotherapy for endometrial cancer), exhibited high resistance (half-maximal inhibitory concentration >10 µM) to the two agents. Therefore, assay systems using F‑PDOs may be utilized to evaluate anticancer agents using conditions that better reflect clinical conditions, compared with conventional methods using cancer cell lines, and to discover markers that identify the pharmacological effects of anticancer agents.	
32374292        	Current and innovative approaches in the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: the role of transurethral resection of bladder tumor and organoids.            	Background Bladder cancer is the 7th most common cancer in men. About 75% of all bladder cancer are non-muscle invasive (NMIBC). The golden standard for definite diagnosis and first-line treatment of NMIBC is transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURB). Historically, the monopolar current was used first, today bipolar current is preferred by most urologists. Following TURB, depending on the tumour grade, additional intravesical chemo- or/and immunotherapy is indicated, in order to prevent recurrence and need for surgical resection. Development of new technologies, molecular and cell biology, enabled scientists to develop organoids - systems of human cells that are cultivated in the laboratory and have characteristics of the tissue from which they were harvested. In the field of urologic cancers, the organoids are used mainly for studying the course of different diseases, however, in the field of bladder cancer the data are scarce. Conclusions Different currents - monopolar and bipolar, have different effect on urothelium, that is important for oncological results and pathohistological interpretation. Specimens of bladder cancer can be used for preparation of organoids that are further used for studying carcinogenesis. Bladder organoids are step towards personalised medicine, especially for testing effectiveness of chemo-/immunotherapeutics.	
32771979        	Human Lung Adenocarcinoma-Derived Organoid Models for Drug Screening.            	Lung cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease, and its treatment remains one of the most challenging tasks in medicine. Few existing laboratory lung cancer models can faithfully recapitulate the diversity of the disease and predict therapy response. Here, we establish 12 patient-derived organoids from the most common lung cancer subtype, lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). Extensive gene and histopathology profiling show that the tumor organoids retain the histological architectures, genomic landscapes, and gene expression profiles of their parental tumors. Patient-derived lung cancer organoids are amenable for biomarker identification and high-throughput drug screening in vitro. This study should enable the generation of patient-derived lung cancer organoid lines, which can be used to further the understanding of lung cancer pathophysiology and to assess drug response in personalized medicine.

32826461        	Organoid in colorectal cancer: progress and challenges.            	Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) currently represent important modeling tools in pre-clinical investigation of malignancies. Organoid cultures conserve the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the original tumor and maintain its heterogeneity, allowing their application in many research fields. PDOs derived from colorectal cancer (CRC) have been used for genetic modeling to investigate the function of driver genes. Some researchers have been exploring the value of CRC PDOs in chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiotherapy response prediction. The successful generation of PDOs derived from CRC could deepen our understanding of CRC biology and provide novel tools for cancer modeling, for realizing precision medicine by assessing specimens from individual patients ex vivo. The present review discusses recently reported advances in CRC PDOs and the challenges they face as pre-clinical models in CRC research.	
30364784        	Dynamic Formation of Microvillus Inclusions During Enterocyte Differentiation in Munc18-2-Deficient Intestinal Organoids.            	Microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) is a congenital intestinal malabsorption disorder caused by defective apical vesicular transport. Existing cellular models do not fully recapitulate this heterogeneous pathology. The aim of this study was to characterize 3-dimensional intestinal organoids that continuously generate polarized absorptive cells as an accessible and relevant model to investigate MVID.                Intestinal organoids from Munc18-2/Stxbp2-null mice that are deficient for apical vesicular transport were subjected to enterocyte-specific differentiation protocols. Lentiviral rescue experiments were performed using human MUNC18-2 variants. Apical trafficking and microvillus formation were characterized by confocal and transmission electron microscopy. Spinning disc time-lapse microscopy was used to document the lifecycle of microvillus inclusions.                Loss of Munc18-2/Stxbp2 recapitulated the pathologic features observed in patients with MUNC18-2 deficiency. The defects were fully restored by transgenic wild-type human MUNC18-2 protein, but not the patient variant (P477L). Importantly, we discovered that the MVID phenotype was correlated with the degree of enterocyte differentiation: secretory vesicles accumulated already in crypt progenitors, while differentiated enterocytes showed an apical tubulovesicular network and enlarged lysosomes. Upon prolonged enterocyte differentiation, cytoplasmic F-actin-positive foci were observed that further progressed into classic microvillus inclusions. Time-lapse microscopy showed their dynamic formation by intracellular maturation or invagination of the apical or basolateral plasma membrane.                We show that prolonged enterocyte-specific differentiation is required to recapitulate the entire spectrum of MVID. Primary organoids can provide a powerful model for this heterogeneous pathology. Formation of microvillus inclusions from multiple membrane sources showed an unexpected dynamic of the enterocyte brush border.	
29535828        	Morphological alterations of cultured human colorectal matched tumour and healthy organoids.            	Organoids have extensive applications in many fields ranging from modelling human development and disease, personalised medicine, drug screening, etc. Moreover, in the last few years, several studies have evaluated the capacity of organoids as transplantation sources for therapeutic approaches and regenerative medicine. Nevertheless, depending on the origin of the cells and anatomical complications, an organoid transplant may make tissue regeneration difficult. However, some essential aspects of organoids including the morphological alterations and the growth pattern of the matched tumour and their healthy derived organoids have received less attention. Therefore, the current work focused on culturing matched healthy and tumour organoids from the same patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and assessed their timed growth and structural differences on a daily basis. The healthy organoids underwent proliferation and branching morphogenesis, while the tumour organoids did not follow the same pattern, and the majority of them developed cystic structures instead. However, the number and size of tumour organoids were different from one patient to another. The differential morphological changes of the healthy versus human colonic tumour organoids likely linked to distinct molecular and cellular events during each day. Thus, while their specific structural features provide valuable in vitro models to study various aspects of human intestinal/colon tissue homeostasis and CRC which avoid or replace the use of animals in research, this model may also hold a great promise for the transplantation and regenerative medicine applications.	
33309780        	A novel integrated system using patient-derived glioma cerebral organoids and xenografts for disease modeling and drug screening.            	A physiologically relevant glioma tumor model is important to the study of disease progression and screening drug candidates. However, current preclinical glioma models lack the brain microenvironment, and the established tumor cell lines do not represent glioma biology and cannot be used to evaluate the therapeutic effect. Here, we reported a real-time integrated system by generating 3D ex vivo cerebral organoids and in vivo xenograft tumors based on glioma patient-derived tissues and cells. Our system faithfully recapitulated the histological features, response to chemotherapy drugs, and clinical progression of their corresponding parental tumors. Additionally, our model successfully identified a case from a grade II astrocytoma patient with typical grade IV GBM features in both organoids and xenograft models, which mimicked the disease progression of this patient. Further genomic and transcriptomic characterization was associated with individual clinical features. We have demonstrated the "GBM-&Normal-like" signature to predict prognosis. In conclusion, we developed an integrated system of parallel models from patient-derived glioma cerebral organoids and xenografts for understanding the glioma biology and prediction of response to chemotherapy drugs, which might lead to a new strategy for personalized treatment for this deadly disease.

27939219        	Induced Quiescence of Lgr5+ Stem Cells in Intestinal Organoids Enables Differentiation of Hormone-Producing Enteroendocrine Cells.            	Lgr5+ adult intestinal stem cells are highly proliferative throughout life. Single Lgr5+ stem cells can be cultured into three-dimensional organoids containing all intestinal epithelial cell types at near-normal ratios. Conditions to generate the main cell types (enterocyte, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M cells) are well established, but signals to induce the spectrum of hormone-producing enteroendocrine cells (EECs) have remained elusive. Here, we induce Lgr5+ stem cell quiescence in vitro by blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in organoids and show that their quiescent state is readily reverted. Quiescent Lgr5+ stem cells acquire a distinct molecular signature biased toward EEC differentiation. Indeed, combined inhibition of Wnt, Notch, and MAPK pathways efficiently generates a diversity of EEC hormone-expressing subtypes in vitro. Our observations uncouple Wnt-dependent stem cell maintenance from EGF-dependent proliferation and provide an approach for the study of the elusive EECs in a defined environment.

32990680        	PDX-derived organoids model in vivo drug response and secrete biomarkers.            	Patient-derived organoid models are proving to be a powerful platform for both basic and translational studies. Here we conduct a methodical analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor organoid drug response in paired patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and PDX-derived organoid (PXO) models grown under WNT-free culture conditions. We report a specific relationship between area under the curve value of organoid drug dose response and in vivo tumor growth, irrespective of the drug treatment. In addition, we analyzed the glycome of PDX and PXO models and demonstrate that PXOs recapitulate the in vivo glycan landscape. In addition, we identify a core set of 57 N-glycans detected in all 10 models that represent 50%-94% of the relative abundance of all N-glycans detected in each of the models. Last, we developed a secreted biomarker discovery pipeline using media supernatant of organoid cultures and identified potentially new extracellular vesicle (EV) protein markers. We validated our findings using plasma samples from patients with PDAC, benign gastrointestinal diseases, and chronic pancreatitis and discovered that 4 EV proteins are potential circulating biomarkers for PDAC. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of organoid cultures to not only model in vivo drug responses but also serve as a powerful platform for discovering clinically actionable serologic biomarkers.	
26748754        	Engineering Stem Cell Organoids.            	Organoid systems leverage the self-organizing properties of stem cells to create diverse multi-cellular tissue proxies. Most organoid models only represent single or partial components of a tissue, and it is often difficult to control the cell type, organization, and cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions within these systems. Herein, we discuss basic approaches to generate stem cell-based organoids, their advantages and limitations, and how bioengineering strategies can be used to steer the cell composition and their 3D organization within organoids to further enhance their utility in research and therapies.

25201529        	Identification of multipotent luminal progenitor cells in human prostate organoid cultures.            	The prostate gland consists of basal and luminal cells arranged as pseudostratified epithelium. In tissue recombination models, only basal cells reconstitute a complete prostate gland, yet murine lineage-tracing experiments show that luminal cells generate basal cells. It has remained challenging to address the molecular details of these transitions and whether they apply to humans, due to the lack of culture conditions that recapitulate prostate gland architecture. Here, we describe a 3D culture system that supports long-term expansion of primary mouse and human prostate organoids, composed of fully differentiated CK5+ basal and CK8+ luminal cells. Organoids are genetically stable, reconstitute prostate glands in recombination assays, and can be experimentally manipulated. Single human luminal and basal cells give rise to organoids, yet luminal-cell-derived organoids more closely resemble prostate glands. These data support a luminal multilineage progenitor cell model for prostate tissue and establish a robust, scalable system for mechanistic studies.                 Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

29192263        	Comprehensive high-throughput image analysis for therapeutic efficacy of architecturally complex heterotypic organoids.            	Bioengineered three-dimensional (3D) tumor models that incorporate heterotypic cellular communication are gaining interest as they can recapitulate key features regarding the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer tissues. However, the architectural complexity and heterogeneous contents associated with these models pose a challenge for toxicological assays to accurately report treatment outcomes. To address this issue, we describe a comprehensive image analysis procedure for structurally complex organotypic cultures (CALYPSO) applied to fluorescence-based assays to extract multiparametric readouts of treatment effects for heterotypic tumor cultures that enables advanced analyses. The capacity of this approach is exemplified on various 3D models including adherent/suspension, mono-/heterocellular cultures and several disease types. The subsequent analysis revealed specific morphological effects of oxaliplatin chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. The procedure can be readily implemented in most laboratories to facilitate high-throughput toxicological screening of pharmaceutical agents and treatment regimens on organotypic cultures of human disease to expedite drug and therapy development.	
31262743        	Predictive Potential of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Organoids.            	In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Driehuis and colleagues establish culture conditions for the rapid, efficient, and long-term expansion of healthy human oral mucosa and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor organoids. The HNSCC tumor organoids provide a functional platform for analyzing tumor cell phenotype, tumorigenic potential, and drug and radiotherapy response, and they have a potential role in clinical decision-making.See related article by Driehuis et al., p. 852.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
27560176        	Culture and establishment of self-renewing human and mouse adult liver and pancreas 3D organoids and their genetic manipulation.            	Adult somatic tissues have proven difficult to expand in vitro, largely because of the complexity of recreating appropriate environmental signals in culture. We have overcome this problem recently and developed culture conditions for adult stem cells that allow the long-term expansion of adult primary tissues from small intestine, stomach, liver and pancreas into self-assembling 3D structures that we have termed 'organoids'. We provide a detailed protocol that describes how to grow adult mouse and human liver and pancreas organoids, from cell isolation and long-term expansion to genetic manipulation in vitro. Liver and pancreas cells grow in a gel-based extracellular matrix (ECM) and a defined medium. The cells can self-organize into organoids that self-renew in vitro while retaining their tissue-of-origin commitment, genetic stability and potential to differentiate into functional cells in vitro (hepatocytes) and in vivo (hepatocytes and endocrine cells). Genetic modification of these organoids opens up avenues for the manipulation of adult stem cells in vitro, which could facilitate the study of human biology and allow gene correction for regenerative medicine purposes. The complete protocol takes 1-4 weeks to generate self-renewing 3D organoids and to perform genetic manipulation experiments. Personnel with basic scientific training can conduct this protocol.	
30842936        	Organoids Increase the Predictive Value of in vitro Cancer Chemoprevention Studies for in vivo Outcome.            	Epidemiological and preclinical data suggest that antioxidants are protective against prostate cancer whose pathogenesis has been linked to oxidative stress. However, the selenium and vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), found no efficacy for selenium in reducing prostate cancer incidence while vitamin E was associated with an increased risk of the disease. These results have called in to question the models used in preclinical chemoprevention efficacy studies and their ability to predict in vivo outcomes. Chemoprevention agents have traditionally been tested on two dimensional monolayer cultures of cell lines derived from advanced prostate cancers. But as SELECT demonstrates, results from advanced disease models were not predictive of the outcome of a primary chemoprevention trial. Additionally, lack of cell-matrix interactions in two dimensional cultures results in loss of biochemical and mechanical cues relevant for native tissue architecture. We use recent findings in three dimensional organoid cultures that recapitulated the SELECT trial results to argue that the organoid model could increase the predictive value of in vitro studies for in vivo outcomes.

33432071        	Ethanol exposure drives colon location specific cell composition changes in a normal colon crypt 3D organoid model.            	Alcohol is a consistently identified risk factor for colon cancer. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its effect on normal colon crypt cells remains poorly understood. We employed RNA-sequencing to asses transcriptomic response to ethanol exposure (0.2% vol:vol) in 3D organoid lines derived from healthy colon (n = 34). Paired regression analysis identified 2,162 differentially expressed genes in response to ethanol. When stratified by colon location, a far greater number of differentially expressed genes were identified in organoids derived from the left versus right colon, many of which corresponded to cell-type specific markers. To test the hypothesis that the effects of ethanol treatment on colon organoid populations were in part due to differential cell composition, we incorporated external single cell RNA-sequencing data from normal colon biopsies to estimate cellular proportions following single cell deconvolution. We inferred cell-type-specific changes, and observed an increase in transit amplifying cells following ethanol exposure that was greater in organoids from the left than right colon, with a concomitant decrease in more differentiated cells. If this occurs in the colon following alcohol consumption, this would lead to an increased zone of cells in the lower crypt where conditions are optimal for cell division and the potential to develop mutations.

33169003        	Generation and biobanking of patient-derived glioblastoma organoids and their application in CAR T cell testing.            	Glioblastoma tumors exhibit extensive inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity, which has contributed to the poor outcomes of numerous clinical trials and continues to complicate the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Most in vitro models do not preserve the cellular and mutational diversity of parent tumors and often require a lengthy generation time with variable efficiency. Here, we describe detailed procedures for generating glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) from surgically resected patient tumor tissue using a chemically defined medium without cell dissociation. By preserving cell-cell interactions and minimizing clonal selection, GBOs maintain the cellular heterogeneity of parent tumors. We include details of how to passage and cryopreserve GBOs for continued use, biobanking and long-term recovery. In addition, we describe procedures for investigating patient-specific responses to immunotherapies by co-culturing GBOs with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. It takes ~2-4 weeks to generate GBOs and 5-7 d to perform CAR T cell co-culture using this protocol. Competence with human cell culture, tissue processing, immunohistology and microscopy is required for optimal results.	
29786552        	Intestinal organoids for modelling intestinal development and disease.            	Gastrointestinal diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent in developed countries. Immortalized cells and animal models have delivered important but limited insight into the mechanisms that initiate and propagate these diseases. Human-specific models of intestinal development and disease are desperately needed that can recapitulate structure and function of the gut in vitro Advances in pluripotent stem cells and primary tissue culture techniques have made it possible to culture intestinal epithelial cells in three dimensions that self-assemble to form 'intestinal organoids'. These organoids allow for new, human-specific models that can be used to gain insight into gastrointestinal disease and potentially deliver new therapies to treat them. Here we review current in vitro models of intestinal development and disease, considering where improvements could be made and potential future applications in the fields of developmental modelling, drug/toxicity testing and therapeutic uses.This article is part of the theme issue 'Designer human tissue: coming to a lab near you'.                © 2018 The Author(s).	
29755963        	Environmental Toxin Screening Using Human-Derived 3D Bioengineered Liver and Cardiac Organoids.            	Environmental toxins, such as lead and other heavy metals, pesticides, and other compounds, represent a significant health concern within the USA and around the world. Even in the twenty-first century, a plethora of cities and towns in the U.S. have suffered from exposures to lead in drinking water or other heavy metals in food or the earth, while there is a high possibility of further places to suffer such exposures in the near future.                We employed bioengineered 3D human liver and cardiac organoids to screen a panel of environmental toxins (lead, mercury, thallium, and glyphosate), and charted the response of the organoids to these compounds. Liver and cardiac organoids were exposed to lead (10 µM-10 mM), mercury (200 nM-200 µM), thallium (10 nM-10 µM), or glyphosate (25 µM-25 mM) for a duration of 48 h. The impacts of toxin exposure were then assessed by LIVE/DEAD viability and cytotoxicity staining, measuring ATP activity and determining IC50 values, and determining changes in cardiac organoid beating activity.                As expected, all of the toxins induced toxicity in the organoids. Both ATP and LIVE/DEAD assays showed toxicity in both liver and cardiac organoids. In particular, thallium was the most toxic, with IC50 values of 13.5 and 1.35 µM in liver and cardiac organoids, respectively. Conversely, glyphosate was the least toxic of the four compounds, with IC50 values of 10.53 and 10.85 mM in liver and cardiac organoids, respectively. Additionally, toxins had a negative influence on cardiac organoid beating activity as well. Thallium resulting in the most significant decreases in beating rate, followed by mercury, then glyphosate, and finally, lead. These results suggest that the 3D organoids have significant utility to be deployed in additional toxicity screening applications, and future development of treatments to mitigate exposures.                3D organoids have significant utility to be deployed in additional toxicity screening applications, such as future development of treatments to mitigate exposures, drug screening, and environmental toxin detection.	
31961880        	Between-tumor and within-tumor heterogeneity in invasive potential.            	For women with access to healthcare and early detection, breast cancer deaths are caused primarily by metastasis rather than growth of the primary tumor. Metastasis has been difficult to study because it happens deep in the body, occurs over years, and involves a small fraction of cells from the primary tumor. Furthermore, within-tumor heterogeneity relevant to metastasis can also lead to therapy failures and is obscured by studies of bulk tissue. Here we exploit heterogeneity to identify molecular mechanisms of metastasis. We use "organoids", groups of hundreds of tumor cells taken from a patient and grown in the lab, to probe tumor heterogeneity, with potentially thousands of organoids generated from a single tumor. We show that organoids have the character of biological replicates: within-tumor and between-tumor variation are of similar magnitude. We develop new methods based on population genetics and variance components models to build between-tumor and within-tumor statistical tests, using organoids analogously to large sibships and vastly amplifying the test power. We show great efficiency for tests based on the organoids with the most extreme phenotypes and potential cost savings from pooled tests of the extreme tails, with organoids generated from hundreds of tumors having power predicted to be similar to bulk tests of hundreds of thousands of tumors. We apply these methods to an association test for molecular correlates of invasion, using a novel quantitative invasion phenotype calculated as the spectral power of the organoid boundary. These new approaches combine to show a strong association between invasion and protein expression of Keratin 14, a known biomarker for poor prognosis, with p = 2 × 10-45 for within-tumor tests of individual organoids and p < 10-6 for pooled tests of extreme tails. Future studies using these methods could lead to discoveries of new classes of cancer targets and development of corresponding therapeutics.

29288165        	Regenerating human epithelia with cultured stem cells: feeder cells, organoids and beyond.            	More than 40 years ago, Howard Green's laboratory developed a method for long-term expansion of primary human epidermal keratinocytes by co-culture with 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This was a breakthrough for in vitro cultivation of cells from human skin and later for other epithelia: it led to the first stem cell therapy using cultured cells and has vastly increased our understanding of epithelial stem cell biology. In recent years, new methods to expand epithelial cells as three-dimensional organoids have provided novel means to investigate the functions of these cells in health and disease. Here, we outline the history of stratified epithelial stem cell culture and the application of cultured epithelial cells in clinical therapies. We further discuss the derivation of organoids from other types of epithelia and the challenges that remain for the translation of novel stem cell therapies toward clinical use.                © 2017 The Authors.

33371412        	Breast Cancer Organoids Model Patient-Specific Response to Drug Treatment.            	Tumor organoids are tridimensional cell culture systems that are generated in vitro from surgically resected patients' tumors. They can be propagated in culture maintaining several features of the tumor of origin, including cellular and genetic heterogeneity, thus representing a promising tool for precision cancer medicine. Here, we established patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) from different breast cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, and triple negative). The established model systems showed histological and genomic concordance with parental tumors. However, in PDOs, the ratio of diverse cell populations was frequently different from that originally observed in parental tumors. We showed that tumor organoids represent a valuable system to test the efficacy of standard therapeutic treatments and to identify drug resistant populations within tumors. We also report that inhibitors of mechanosignaling and of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) activation can restore chemosensitivity in drug resistant tumor organoids.	
32085455        	Immersion Bioprinting of Tumor Organoids in Multi-Well Plates for Increasing Chemotherapy Screening Throughput.            	The current drug development pipeline takes approximately fifteen years and $2.6 billion to get a new drug to market. Typically, drugs are tested on two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and animal models to estimate their efficacy before reaching human trials. However, these models are often not representative of the human body. The 2D culture changes the morphology and physiology of cells, and animal models often have a vastly different anatomy and physiology than humans. The use of bioengineered human cell-based organoids may increase the probability of success during human trials by providing human-specific preclinical data. They could also be deployed for personalized medicine diagnostics to optimize therapies in diseases such as cancer. However, one limitation in employing organoids in drug screening has been the difficulty in creating large numbers of homogeneous organoids in form factors compatible with high-throughput screening (e.g., 96- and 384-well plates). Bioprinting can be used to scale up deposition of such organoids and tissue constructs. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to 3D print hydrogel bioinks into small-sized wells due to well-bioink interactions that can result in bioinks spreading out and wetting the well surface instead of maintaining a spherical form. Here, we demonstrate an immersion printing technique to bioprint tissue organoids in 96-well plates to increase the throughput of 3D drug screening. A hydrogel bioink comprised of hyaluronic acid and collagen is bioprinted into a viscous gelatin bath, which blocks the bioink from interacting with the well walls and provides support to maintain a spherical form. This method was validated using several cancerous cell lines, and then applied to patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) and sarcoma biospecimens for drug screening.	
33377086        	Establishment of Pancreatic Organoids from Normal Tissue and Tumors.            	Establishment of patient-derived adult stem cell-based pancreatic (tumor) organoids was first described in 2015. Since then, multiple laboratories have demonstrated the robustness of this method. We recently described the generation of a pancreatic cancer biobank containing 30 well-characterized tumor organoid models. Here, we describe the applied methods in detail. Use of tumor-selective media prevents contamination with normal cells. Generated organoids can be cryopreserved and can serve as a living biobank of pancreatic cancer for biomarker identification and drug screening.

33597597        	Role of adenomatous polyposis coli in proliferation and differentiation of colon epithelial cells in organoid culture.            	Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a tumor-suppressing protein whose inactivation triggers the formation of colorectal polyps. Numerous studies using cell lines or genetically engineered mice have revealed its role in suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we performed genetic analyses of APC using a three-dimensional organoid culture of mouse colon epithelia, which enables the detailed examination of epithelial properties. Analyses of Apc-knockout colon organoids not only confirmed the importance of APC in suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling and regulating cell differentiation, but also revealed several novel features: a significant decrease in proliferating speed and an increase in cross-sectional area of cells. Moreover, we found a significant number of lysozyme-positive Paneth-like cells, which were never observed in wild-type colon tissues or organoids, but have been reported to emerge in colon cancers. Therefore, APC autonomously suppresses ectopic differentiation into lysozyme-positive cells, specifically in the colon epithelia. Colon organoids would be an ideal material to investigate the molecular mechanism and biological importance of the ectopic differentiation associated with cancer development.	
32183493        	Establishment and Molecular Phenotyping of Organoids from the Squamocolumnar Junction Region of the Uterine Cervix.            	The metaplastic epithelium of the transformation zone (TZ) including the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) of the uterine cervix is a prime target of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and subsequent cancer development. Due to the lack of adequate in vitro models for SCJ, however, investigations into its physiological roles and vulnerability to carcinogenesis have been limited. By using Matrigel-based three-dimensional culture techniques, we propagated organoids derived from the normal SCJ region, along with metaplastic squamous cells in the TZ. Consisting predominantly of squamous cells, organoids basically exhibited a dense structure. However, at least in some organoids, a small but discrete population of mucin-producing endocervix cells co-existed adjacent to the squamous cell population, virtually recapitulating the configuration of SCJ in a TZ background. In addition, transcriptome analysis confirmed a higher expression level of many SCJ marker genes in organoids, compared to that in the immortalized cervical cell lines of non-SCJ origin. Thus, the obtained organoids appear to mimic cervical SCJ cells and, in particular, metaplastic squamous cells from the TZ, likely providing a novel platform in which HPV-driven cervical cancer development could be investigated.	
30629588        	Whole genomes define concordance of matched primary, xenograft, and organoid models of pancreas cancer.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among solid malignancies and improved therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) serve as promising tools to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. For these preclinical disease models to be effective, they should both recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. To date however, deep characterization of the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC PDX and PDO models and comparison with matched human tumour remains largely unaddressed at the whole genome level. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 'trios' of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. We found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.	
33279281        	Deciphering Organoids: High-Dimensional Analysis of Biomimetic Cultures.            	Organoids are self-organising stem cell-derived ex vivo cultures widely adopted as biomimetic models of healthy and diseased tissues. Traditional low-dimensional experimental methods such as microscopy and bulk molecular analysis have generated remarkable biological insights from organoids. However, as complex heterocellular systems, organoids are especially well-positioned to take advantage of emerging high-dimensional technologies. In particular, single-cell methods offer considerable opportunities to analyse organoids at unprecedented scale and depth, enabling comprehensive characterisation of cellular processes and spatial organisation underpinning organoid heterogeneity. This review evaluates state-of-the-art analytical methods applied to organoids, discusses the latest advances in single-cell technologies, and speculates on the integration of these two rapidly developing fields.

33120912        	A Four-Dimensional Organoid System to Visualize Cancer Cell Vascular Invasion.            	Vascular invasion of cancer is a critical step in cancer progression, but no drug has been developed to inhibit vascular invasion. To achieve the eradication of cancer metastasis, elucidation of the mechanism for vascular invasion and the development of innovative treatment methods are required. Here, a simple and reproducible vascular invasion model is established using a vascular organoid culture in a fibrin gel with collagen microfibers. Using this model, it was possible to observe and evaluate the cell dynamics and histological positional relationship of invasive cancer cells in four dimensions. Cancer-derived exosomes promoted the vascular invasion of cancer cells and loosened tight junctions in the vascular endothelium. As a new evaluation method, research using this vascular invasion mimic model will be advanced, and applications to the evaluation of the vascular invasion suppression effect of a drug are expected.	
29212456        	Helicobacter-induced gastric inflammation alters the properties of gastric tissue stem/progenitor cells.            	Although Helicobacter-induced gastric inflammation is the major predisposing factor for gastric carcinogenesis, the precise mechanism by which chronic gastritis causes gastric cancer remains unclear. Intestinal and spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) is considered as precancerous lesions, changes in epithelial tissue stem/progenitor cells after chronic inflammation has not been clarified yet. In this study, we utilized three-dimensional gastric epithelial cell culture systems that could form organoids, mimicking gastric epithelial layer, and characterized the changes in epithelial cells after chronic Helicobacter felis infection.                We used three mice model; 1) long-term H. felis infection, 2) H. felis eradication, and 3) MNU chemical carcinogenesis model. We performed cRNA microarray analysis after organoid culture, and analyzed the effects of chronic gastric inflammation on tissue stem cells, by the size of organoid, mRNA expression profile and immunohistochemical analysis.                The number of organoids cultured from gastric epithelial cells was significantly higher in organoids isolated from H. felis-infected mice compared with those from uninfected gastric mucosa. Based on the mRNA expression profile, we found that possible stem cell markers such as Cd44, Dclk1, and genes associated with the intestinal phenotype, such as Villin, were increased in organoids isolated from H. felis-infected mucosa compared with the control. The upregulation of these genes were cancelled after H. felis eradication. In a xenograft model, tumors were generated only from organoids cultured from carcinogen-treated gastric mucosa, not from H. felis infected mucosa or control organoids.                Our results suggested that, as a possible mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis, chronic inflammation induced by H. felis infection increased the number of tissue stem/progenitor cells and the expression of stem cell markers. These findings suggest that chronic inflammation may alter the direction of differentiation toward undifferentiated state and that drawbacks may enable cells to redifferentiate to intestinal metaplasia or neoplasia.	
32918942        	Human kidney organoids produce functional renin.            	Renin production by the kidney is of vital importance for salt, volume, and blood pressure homeostasis. The lack of human models hampers investigation into the regulation of renin and its relevance for kidney physiology. To develop such a model, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids to study the role of renin and the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney. Extensive characterization of the kidney organoids revealed kidney-specific cell populations consisting of podocytes, proximal and distal tubular cells, stromal cells and endothelial cells. We examined the presence of various components of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin II receptors, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin-converting enzymes 1 and 2. We identified by single-cell sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and functional assays that cyclic AMP stimulation induces a subset of pericytes to increase the synthesis and secretion of enzymatically active renin. Renin production by the organoids was responsive to regulation by parathyroid hormone. Subcutaneously implanted kidney organoids in immunodeficient IL2Ry-/-Rag2-/- mice were successfully vascularized, maintained tubular and glomerular structures, and retained capacity to produce renin two months after implantation. Thus, our results demonstrate that kidney organoids express renin and provide insights into the endocrine potential of human kidney organoids, which is important for regenerative medicine in the context of the endocrine system.

33640383        	Recent advances in organoid development and applications in disease modeling.            	An improved understanding of stem cell niches, organogenesis, and disease models has paved the way for developing a three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture system. Organoid cultures can be derived from primary tissues (single cells or tissue subunits), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), or embryonic stem cells (ESCs). As a significant technological breakthrough, 3D organoid models offer a promising approach for understanding the complexities of human diseases ranging from the mechanistic investigation of disease pathogenesis to therapy. Here, we discuss the recent applications, advantages, and limitations of organoids as in vitro models for studying metabolomics, drug development, infectious diseases, and the gut microbiome. We further discuss the use of organoids in cancer modeling using high throughput sequencing approaches.                Published by Elsevier B.V.	
29915160        	The Endosomal Protein CEMIP Links WNT Signaling to MEK1-ERK1/2 Activation in Selumetinib-Resistant Intestinal Organoids.            	MAPK signaling pathways are constitutively active in colon cancer and also promote acquired resistance to MEK1 inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that BRAFV600E -mutated colorectal cancers acquire resistance to MEK1 inhibition by inducing expression of the scaffold protein CEMIP through a β-catenin- and FRA-1-dependent pathway. CEMIP was found in endosomes and bound MEK1 to sustain ERK1/2 activation in MEK1 inhibitor-resistant BRAFV600E-mutated colorectal cancers. The CEMIP-dependent pathway maintained c-Myc protein levels through ERK1/2 and provided metabolic advantage in resistant cells, potentially by sustaining amino acids synthesis. CEMIP silencing circumvented resistance to MEK1 inhibition, partly, through a decrease of both ERK1/2 signaling and c-Myc. Together, our data identify a cross-talk between Wnt and MAPK signaling cascades, which involves CEMIP. Activation of this pathway promotes survival by potentially regulating levels of specific amino acids via a Myc-associated cascade. Targeting this node may provide a promising avenue for treatment of colon cancers that have acquired resistance to targeted therapies.Significance: MEK1 inhibitor-resistant colorectal cancer relies on the scaffold and endosomal protein CEMIP to maintain ERK1/2 signaling and Myc-driven transcription.

32652008        	Tumor organoids to study gastroesophageal cancer: a primer.            	Gastroesophageal cancers are leading causes of cancer death. Our attempts at adopting molecularly based treatment approaches have been slow and ineffective even though we begin to identify specific targetable gene mutations and pathways. It is clear that we should no longer treat all gastroesophageal cancers as a homogeneous disease, which is what we do when we use non-specific chemotherapy. However, we currently cannot monitor successful gene/pathway targeting, nor understand how/when tumors develop resistance, nor predict which patients will derive maximal benefit. To improve outcomes, we must precisely detail the heterogeneity of these tumors to then individualize cancer therapy as well as develop novel avenues to study and predict treatment effects in individual patients. To this end, patient-derived organoids, in which tumor cells from individual patients are grown in a Petri dish, are a new versatile system that allows for timely expandability, detailed molecular characterization, and genetic manipulation with the promise of enabling predictive assessment of treatment response. In this review, we will explore the development and basic techniques for organoid generation, and discuss the current and potential future applications of this exciting technology to study the basic science of carcinogenesis and to predict/guide cancer patient care in the clinics.                © The Author(s) (2020).

33355212        	Evaluation of Tissue Stem Cell-Derived Human Intestinal Organoids, a Physiologically Relevant Model to Evaluate Cytochrome P450 Induction in Gut.            	Induction of cytochrome P450 can cause drug-drug interactions and efficacy failure. Induction risk in liver and gut is typically inferred from experiments with plated hepatocytes. Organoids are physiologically relevant, multicellular structures originating from stem cells. Intestinal stem cell-derived organoids retain traits of normal gut physiology, such as an epithelial barrier and cellular diversity. Matched human enteroid and colonoid lines, generated from ileal and colon biopsies from two donors, were cultured in extracellular matrix for 3 days, followed by a single 48-hour treatment with rifampin, omeprazole, CITCO, and phenytoin at concentrations that induce target genes in hepatocytes. After treatment, mRNA was analyzed for induction of target genes. Rifampin induced CYP3A4; estimated EC50 and maximal fold induction were 3.75 µM and 8.96-fold, respectively, for ileal organoids and 1.40 µM and 11.3-fold, respectively, for colon organoids. Ileal, but not colon, organoids exhibited nifedipine oxidase activity, which was induced by rifampin up to 14-fold. The test compounds did not increase mRNA expression of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, multidrug resistance transporter 1 (P-glycoprotein), breast cancer resistance protein, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 in ileal organoids. Whereas omeprazole induced CYP3A4 (up to 5.3-fold, geometric mean, n = 4 experiments), constitutive androstane receptor activators phenytoin and CITCO did not. Omeprazole failed to induce CYP1A2 mRNA but did induce CYP1A1 mRNA (up to 7.7-fold and 15-fold in ileal and colon organoids, respectively, n = 4 experiments). Despite relatively high intra- and interexperimental variability, data suggest that the model yields induction responses that are distinct from hepatocytes and holds promise to enable evaluation of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 induction in gut. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: An adult intestinal stem cell-derived organoid model to test P450 induction in gut was evaluated. Testing several prototypical inducers for mRNA induction of P450 isoforms, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, P-glycoprotein, and breast cancer resistance protein with both human colon and ileal organoids resulted in a range of responses, often distinct from those found in hepatocytes, indicating the potential for further development of this model as a physiologically relevant gut induction test system.

32577539        	Enhancing radiation response by a second-generation TRAIL receptor agonist using a new in vitro organoid model system.            	For many cancer types, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC), combined modality treatments have shown to improve outcome, but are frequently associated with significant toxicity, illustrating the need for new therapeutic approaches. Based on preclinical data, TRAIL receptor agonists appeared to be promising agents for cancer therapy especially in combination with DNA damaging regimens. Here, we present the combination of the second-generation TRAIL receptor agonist APG-880 with radiation in a new and clinically relevant 3D model system.                To investigate the effect of APG-880 in combination with radiation we performed short-term cytotoxicity and long-term clonogenic survival assays in established CRC cell lines, and in tumor organoids derived from colon cancer patients.                APG-880 is a potent inducer of apoptosis in CRC cell lines and in patient-derived CRC organoids. Furthermore, a supra-additive effect on cytotoxicity was found when APG-880 and radiation were combined simultaneously, with combination indices around 0.7. Lastly, in the long-term survival assays, we demonstrated a radiosensitizing effect of APG-880 with dose enhancement factors between 1.3 and 1.5.                In a new, clinically relevant CRC-organoid model system we demonstrated a more than additive combined effect between the second-generation TRAIL receptor agonist APG-880 and radiation.                © 2020 The Author(s).	
32853629        	Tumor organoid models in precision medicine and investigating cancer-stromal interactions.            	Tumor development and progression require chemical and mechanical cues derived from cellular and non-cellular components in the tumor microenvironment, including the extracellular matrix (ECM), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, and immune cells. Therefore, it is crucial to develop tissue culture models that can mimic in vivo cancer cell-ECM and cancer-stromal cell interactions. Three-dimensional (3D) tumor culture models have been widely utilized to study cancer development and progression. A recent advance in 3D culture is the development of patient-derived tumor organoid (PDO) models from primary human cancer tissue. PDOs maintain the heterogeneity of the primary tumor, which makes them more relevant for identifying therapeutic targets and verifying drug response. Other significant advances include development of 3D co-culture assays to investigate cell-cell interactions and tissue/organ morphogenesis, and microfluidic technology that can be integrated into 3D culture to mimic vasculature and blood flow. These advances offer spatial and temporal insights into cancer cell-stromal interactions and represent novel techniques to study tumor progression and drug response. Here, we summarize the recent progress in 3D culture and tumor organoid models, and discuss future directions and the potential of utilizing these models to study cancer-stromal interactions and direct personalized treatment.

28665271        	Human embryonic lung epithelial tips are multipotent progenitors that can be expanded in vitro as long-term self-renewing organoids.            	The embryonic mouse lung is a widely used substitute for human lung development. For example, attempts to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to lung epithelium rely on passing through progenitor states that have only been described in mouse. The tip epithelium of the branching mouse lung is a multipotent progenitor pool that self-renews and produces differentiating descendants. We hypothesized that the human distal tip epithelium is an analogous progenitor population and tested this by examining morphology, gene expression and in vitro self-renewal and differentiation capacity of human tips. These experiments confirm that human and mouse tips are analogous and identify signalling pathways that are sufficient for long-term self-renewal of human tips as differentiation-competent organoids. Moreover, we identify mouse-human differences, including markers that define progenitor states and signalling requirements for long-term self-renewal. Our organoid system provides a genetically-tractable tool that will allow these human-specific features of lung development to be investigated.	
31416845        	miR-221 Targets QKI to Enhance the Tumorigenic Capacity of Human Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells.            	miRNAs are key players in the integrated regulation of cellular processes and shape many of the functional properties that define the "cancer stem cell" (CSC) phenotype. Little is known, however, about miRNAs that regulate such properties in human colorectal carcinoma. In this study, we compared the expression levels of 754 miRNAs between paired samples of EpCAM+/CD44+ cancer cells (enriched in CSCs) and EpCAM+/CD44neg cancer cells (with CSC depletion) sorted in parallel from human primary colorectal carcinomas and identified miR-221 as the miRNA that displayed the highest level of preferential expression in EpCAM+/CD44+ cancer cells. High levels of miR-221 expression were associated with Lgr5+ cells in mouse colon crypts and reduced survival in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Constitutive overexpression of miR-221 enhanced organoid-forming capacity of both conventional colorectal carcinoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in vitro. Importantly, constitutive downregulation of miR-221 suppressed organoid-forming capacity in vitro and substantially reduced the tumorigenic capacity of CSC populations from PDX lines in vivo. Finally, the most abundant splicing isoform of the human Quaking (QKI) gene, QKI-5, was identified as a functional target of miR-221; overexpression of miR-221-reduced QKI-5 protein levels in human colorectal carcinoma cells. As expected, overexpression of QKI-5 suppressed organoid-forming capacity in vitro and tumorigenic capacity of colorectal carcinoma PDX cells in vivo. Our study reveals a mechanistic link between miR-221 and QKI and highlights their key role in regulating CSC properties in human colorectal cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings uncover molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of cancer stem cell properties in colon cancer.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/20/5151/F1.large.jpg.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
29544098        	Single Particle Imaging of Polarized Hepatoma Organoids upon Hepatitis C Virus Infection Reveals an Ordered and Sequential Entry Process.            	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters hepatocytes via various entry factors, including scavenger receptor BI (SR-B1), cluster of differentiation 81 (CD81), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), claudin-1 (CLDN1), and occludin (OCLN). As CLDN1 and OCLN are not readily accessible due to their tight junctional localization, HCV likely accesses them by either disrupting cellular polarity or migrating to the tight junction. In this study, we image HCV entry into a three-dimensional polarized hepatoma system and reveal that the virus sequentially engages these entry factors through actin-dependent mechanisms. HCV initially localizes with the early entry factors SR-B1, CD81, and EGFR at the basolateral membrane and then accumulates at the tight junction in an actin-dependent manner. HCV associates with CLDN1 and then OCLN at the tight junction and is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis by an active process requiring EGFR. Thus, HCV uses a dynamic and multi-step process to engage and enter host cells.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
28369043        	Generation of mature T cells from human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in artificial thymic organoids.            	Studies of human T cell development require robust model systems that recapitulate the full span of thymopoiesis, from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) through to mature T cells. Existing in vitro models induce T cell commitment from human HSPCs; however, differentiation into mature CD3+TCR-αβ+ single-positive CD8+ or CD4+ cells is limited. We describe here a serum-free, artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system that supports efficient and reproducible in vitro differentiation and positive selection of conventional human T cells from all sources of HSPCs. ATO-derived T cells exhibited mature naive phenotypes, a diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and TCR-dependent function. ATOs initiated with TCR-engineered HSPCs produced T cells with antigen-specific cytotoxicity and near-complete lack of endogenous TCR Vβ expression, consistent with allelic exclusion of Vβ-encoding loci. ATOs provide a robust tool for studying human T cell differentiation and for the future development of stem-cell-based engineered T cell therapies.	
31760071        	The phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway provides a new target for cancer chemotherapy.            	Since human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) develop into hepatic organoids through stages that resemble human embryonic liver development, they can be used to study developmental processes and disease pathology. Therefore, we examined the early stages of hepatic organoid formation to identify key pathways affecting early liver development.                Single-cell RNA-sequencing and metabolomic analysis was performed on developing organoid cultures at the iPSC, hepatoblast (day 9) and mature organoid stage. The importance of the phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway to early liver development was examined in developing organoid cultures using iPSC with a CRISPR-mediated gene knockout and an over the counter medication (meclizine) that inhibits the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. Meclizine's effect on the growth of a human hepatocarcinoma cell line in a xenotransplantation model and on the growth of acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro was also examined.                Transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of organoid development indicated that the phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway is essential for early liver development. Unexpectedly, early hepatoblasts were selectively sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of meclizine. We demonstrate that meclizine could be repurposed for use in a new synergistic combination therapy for primary liver cancer: a glycolysis inhibitor reprograms cancer cell metabolism to make it susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of meclizine. This combination inhibited the growth of a human liver carcinoma cell line in vitro and in a xenotransplantation model, without causing significant side effects. This drug combination was also highly active against acute myeloid leukemia cells.                Our data indicate that phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis is a targetable pathway for cancer; meclizine may have clinical efficacy as a repurposed anti-cancer drug when used as part of a new combination therapy.                The early stages of human liver development were modeled using human hepatic organoids. We identified a pathway that was essential for early liver development. Based upon this finding, a novel combination drug therapy was identified that could be used to treat primary liver cancer and possibly other types of cancer.

30859153        	Murine Liver Organoids as a Genetically Flexible System to Study Liver Cancer InVivo and In Vitro.            	The rising incidence of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) coupled with a low 5-year survival rate that remains below 10% delineates the urgent need for more effective treatment strategies. Although several recent studies provided detailed information on the genetic landscape of this fatal malignancy, versatile model systems to functionally dissect the immediate clinical relevance of the identified genetic alterations are still missing. To enhance our understanding of CCA pathophysiology and facilitate rapid functional annotation of putative CCA driver and tumor maintenance genes, we developed a tractable murine CCA model by combining the cyclization recombination (Cre)-lox system, RNA interference, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology with liver organoids, followed by subsequent transplantation into immunocompetent, syngeneic mice. Histologically, resulting tumors displayed cytokeratin 19-positive ductal structures surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma-hallmark features of human CCAs. Despite their initial biliary phenotype in vitro, organoids retained the plasticity to induce a broader differentiation spectrum of primary liver cancers following transplantation into recipient mice, depending on their genetic context. Thus, the organoid system combines the advantage of using nontransformed, premalignant cells to recapitulate liver tumorigenesis as a multistep process, with the advantage of a reproducible and expandable cell culture system that abrogates the need for recurrent isolations of primary cells. Conclusion: Genetically modified liver organoids are able to transform into histologically accurate CCAs. Depending on the oncogenic context, they are also able to give rise to liver cancers that show features of hepatocellular carcinomas. The model can be used to functionally explore candidate cancer genes of primary liver cancers in immunocompetent animals and evaluate novel treatment regimens.	
32895569        	Engineering transplantable jejunal mucosal grafts using patient-derived organoids from children with intestinal failure.            	Intestinal failure, following extensive anatomical or functional loss of small intestine, has debilitating long-term consequences for children1. The priority of patient care is to increase the length of functional intestine, particularly the jejunum, to promote nutritional independence2. Here we construct autologous jejunal mucosal grafts using biomaterials from pediatric patients and show that patient-derived organoids can be expanded efficiently in vitro. In parallel, we generate decellularized human intestinal matrix with intact nanotopography, which forms biological scaffolds. Proteomic and Raman spectroscopy analyses reveal highly analogous biochemical profiles of human small intestine and colon scaffolds, indicating that they can be used interchangeably as platforms for intestinal engineering. Indeed, seeding of jejunal organoids onto either type of scaffold reliably reconstructs grafts that exhibit several aspects of physiological jejunal function and that survive to form luminal structures after transplantation into the kidney capsule or subcutaneous pockets of mice for up to 2 weeks. Our findings provide proof-of-concept data for engineering patient-specific jejunal grafts for children with intestinal failure, ultimately aiding in the restoration of nutritional autonomy.	
28736217        	High-Content Screening in hPSC-Neural Progenitors Identifies Drug Candidates that Inhibit Zika Virus Infection in Fetal-like Organoids and Adult Brain.            	Zika virus (ZIKV) infects fetal and adult human brain and is associated with serious neurological complications. To date, no therapeutic treatment is available to treat ZIKV-infected patients. We performed a high-content chemical screen using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) and found that hippeastrine hydrobromide (HH) and amodiaquine dihydrochloride dihydrate (AQ) can inhibit ZIKV infection in hNPCs. Further validation showed that HH also rescues ZIKV-induced growth and differentiation defects in hNPCs and human fetal-like forebrain organoids. Finally, HH and AQ inhibit ZIKV infection in adult mouse brain in vivo. Strikingly, HH suppresses viral propagation when administered to adult mice with active ZIKV infection, highlighting its therapeutic potential. Our approach highlights the power of stem cell-based screens and validation in human forebrain organoids and mouse models in identifying drug candidates for treating ZIKV infection and related neurological complications in fetal and adult patients.

32142663        	Genome-Scale CRISPR Screening in Human Intestinal Organoids Identifies Drivers of TGF-β Resistance.            	Forward genetic screens with genome-wide CRISPR libraries are powerful tools for resolving cellular circuits and signaling pathways. Applying this technology to organoids, however, has been hampered by technical limitations. Here we report improved accuracy and robustness for pooled-library CRISPR screens by capturing sgRNA integrations in single organoids, substantially reducing required cell numbers for genome-scale screening. We applied our approach to wild-type and APC mutant human intestinal organoids to identify genes involved in resistance to TGF-β-mediated growth restriction, a key process during colorectal cancer progression, and validated hits including multiple subunits of the tumor-suppressive SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Mutations within these genes require concurrent inactivation of APC to promote TGF-β resistance and attenuate TGF-β target gene transcription. Our approach can be applied to a variety of assays and organoid types to facilitate biological discovery in primary 3D tissue models.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

29311126        	Preclinical Models of Prostate Cancer: Patient-Derived Xenografts, Organoids, and Other Explant Models.            	Prostate cancer remains a lethal disease. Preclinical cancer models that accurately represent the tumors of the patients they are intended to help are necessary to test potential therapeutic approaches and to better translate research discoveries. However, research in the prostate cancer field is hampered by the limited number of human cell lines and xenograft models, most of which do not recapitulate the human disease seen in the clinic today. This work reviews the recent advances in human patient-derived xenograft, organoid, and other explant models to address this need. In contrast to other tumor streams, the prostate cancer field is challenged by this approach, yet despite the limitations, patient-derived models remain an integral component of the preclinical testing pathway leading to better treatments for men with prostate cancer.

Primary prostate stromal cells increased organoid formation and directed organoid morphology into a branched acini structure similar to what is observed in vivo. Organoid branching occurred distal to physical contact with stromal cells, demonstrating non-random branching. Stroma-induced phenotypes were similar in all patients examined, yet they maintained inter-patient heterogeneity in the degree of response. Stromal cells expressed growth factors involved in epithelial differentiation, which was not observed in non-prostatic fibroblasts. Organoids derived from areas of prostate cancer maintained differential expression of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase and showed increased viability and passaging when co-cultured with stroma. The addition of stroma to epithelial cells in vitro improves the ability of organoids to recapitulate features of the tissue and enhances the viability of organoids.

32840232        	The Progress and Clinical Application of Breast Cancer Organoids.            	Breast cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest incidence in women. Nowadays, the objects in vitro of models of this disease are mainly from breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived patient-derived xenograft (PDX). However, there is a significant gap between traditional cell lines and breast cancer solid tumors, meanwhiles, PDX is not highly consistent with patients due to different species. As a techonlogy, obtaining patient-derived tumor cells, combined with three-dimensional culture technology, adding cytokines that promotes the proliferation of breast cancer stem cells and inhibit their apoptosis, breast cancer organoids form a structure in vitro which is similar to tumor in the body. This model can not only study the occurrence and envolution of breast cancer, but is more prominent in clinical application. screening drugs by high-throughput, personalized treatment, textingtoxicity and immunotherapy. This article will review the breast cancer organoids, in evolution, source, culture system and clinical applications.	
32348727        	Pooled In Vitro and In Vivo CRISPR-Cas9 Screening Identifies Tumor Suppressors in Human Colon Organoids.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by prominent genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity between patients. To facilitate high-throughput genetic testing and functional identification of tumor drivers, we developed a platform for pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening in human colon organoids. Using transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) resistance as a paradigm to establish sensitivity and scalability in vitro, we identified optimal conditions and strict guide RNA (gRNA) requirements for screening in 3D organoids. We then screened a pan-cancer tumor suppressor gene (TSG) library in pre-malignant organoids with APC-/-;KRASG12D mutations, which were xenografted to study clonal advantages in context of a complex tumor microenvironment. We identified TGFBR2 as the most prevalent TSG, followed by known and previously uncharacterized mediators of CRC growth. gRNAs were validated in a secondary screen using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to adjust for clonal drift and to distinguish clone size and abundance. Together, these findings highlight a powerful organoid-based platform for pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening for patient-specific functional genomics.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

30353166        	Suppression of interferon gene expression overcomes resistance to MEK inhibition in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer.            	Despite showing clinical activity in BRAF-mutant melanoma, the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) trametinib has failed to show clinical benefit in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. To identify mechanisms of resistance to MEKi, we employed a pharmacogenomic analysis of MEKi-sensitive versus MEKi-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. Strikingly, interferon- and inflammatory-related gene sets were enriched in cell lines exhibiting intrinsic and acquired resistance to MEK inhibition. The bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 suppressed interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and in combination with MEK inhibitors displayed synergistic effects and induced apoptosis in MEKi-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. ISG expression was confirmed in patient-derived organoid models, which displayed resistance to trametinib and were resensitized by JQ1 co-treatment. In in vivo models of colorectal cancer, combination treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth. Our findings provide a novel explanation for the limited response to MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer, known for its inflammatory nature. Moreover, the high expression of ISGs was associated with significantly reduced survival of colorectal cancer patients. Excitingly, we have identified novel therapeutic opportunities to overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to MEK inhibition in colorectal cancer.

33533008        	Endometrial Organoids: A Rising Star for Research on Endometrial Development and Associated Diseases.            	The endometrium is one of the most dynamic organs in the human body. Until now, cell lines have furthered the understanding of endometrial biology and associated diseases, but they failed to recapitulate the key physiological aspects of the endometrium, especially as it relates to its complex architecture and functions. Organoid culture systems have become an alternative approach to reproduce biological functions of tissues in vitro. Endometrial organoids have now been established from stem/progenitor cells and/or differentiated cells by several methods, which represents a promising tool to gain a deeper understanding of this dynamic organ. In this review, we will discuss the establishment, characteristics, applications, and potential challenges and directions of endometrial organoids.	
32745985        	Spatiotemporal Gradient and Instability of Wnt Induce Heterogeneous Growth and Differentiation of Human Intestinal Organoids.            	In a conventional culture of three-dimensional human intestinal organoids, extracellular matrix hydrogel has been used to provide a physical space for the growth and morphogenesis of organoids in the presence of exogenous morphogens such as Wnt3a. We found that organoids embedded in a dome-shaped hydrogel show significant size heterogeneity in different locations inside the hydrogel. Computational simulations revealed that the instability and diffusion limitation of Wnt3a constitutively generate a concentration gradient inside the hydrogel. The location-dependent heterogeneity of organoids in a hydrogel dome substantially perturbed the transcriptome profile associated with epithelial functions, cytodifferentiation including mucin 2 expression, and morphological characteristics. This heterogeneous phenotype was significantly mitigated when the Wnt3a was frequently replenished in the culture medium. Our finding suggests that the morphological, transcriptional, translational, and functional heterogeneity in conventional organoid cultures may lead to a false interpretation of the experimental results in organoid-based studies.

32976661        	Upregulation of S100A10 in metastasized breast cancer stem cells.            	Metastatic progression remains the major cause of death in human breast cancer. Cancer cells with cancer stem cell (CSC) properties drive initiation and growth of metastases at distant sites. We have previously established the breast cancer patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) mouse model in which CSC marker CD44+ cancer cells formed spontaneous microscopic metastases in the liver. In this PDX mouse, the expression levels of S100A10 and its family proteins were much higher in the CD44+ cancer cells metastasized to the liver than those at the primary site. Knockdown of S100A10 in breast cancer cells suppressed and overexpression of S100A10 in breast cancer PDX cells enhanced their invasion abilities and 3D organoid formation capacities in vitro. Mechanistically, S100A10 regulated the matrix metalloproteinase activity and the expression levels of stem cell-related genes. Finally, constitutive knockdown of S100A10 significantly reduced their metastatic ability to the liver in vivo. These findings suggest that S100A10 functions as a metastasis promoter of breast CSCs by conferring both invasion ability and CSC properties in breast cancers.                © 2020 The Authors.

32645991        	Three-Dimensional Regeneration of Patient-Derived Intestinal Organoid Epithelium in a Physiodynamic Mucosal Interface-on-a-Chip.            	The regeneration of the mucosal interface of the human intestine is critical in the host-gut microbiome crosstalk associated with gastrointestinal diseases. The biopsy-derived intestinal organoids provide genetic information of patients with physiological cytodifferentiation. However, the enclosed lumen and static culture condition substantially limit the utility of patient-derived organoids for microbiome-associated disease modeling. Here, we report a patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) physiodynamic mucosal interface-on-a-chip (PMI Chip) that provides a microphysiological intestinal milieu under defined biomechanics. The real-time imaging and computational simulation of the PMI Chip verified the recapitulation of non-linear luminal and microvascular flow that simulates the hydrodynamics in a living human gut. The multiaxial deformations in a convoluted microchannel not only induced dynamic cell strains but also enhanced particle mixing in the lumen microchannel. Under this physiodynamic condition, an organoid-derived epithelium obtained from the patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or colorectal cancer independently formed 3D epithelial layers with disease-specific differentiations. Moreover, co-culture with the human fecal microbiome in an anoxic-oxic interface resulted in the formation of stochastic microcolonies without a loss of epithelial barrier function. We envision that the patient-specific PMI Chip that conveys genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors of individual patients will potentially demonstrate the pathophysiological dynamics and complex host-microbiome crosstalk to target a patient-specific disease modeling.	
25636467        	Generation and analysis of mouse intestinal tumors and organoids harboring APC and K-Ras mutations.            	Genetically engineered mouse models of intestinal cancer are experimental systems in which mice are genetically manipulated to develop malignancies in the gastrointestinal tract. These models enable researchers to study the mechanisms of onset, progression, and metastasis of the disease. They also provide a valuable biological system which is suitable for testing (novel) drugs in vivo. Recently, an in vitro culture model has been established in which intestinal epithelial stem cells can grow into three-dimensional, ever-expanding epithelial organoids that retain their original organ identity and genetic stability. This culture system has been applied to diseased epithelia, such as adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and Barrett's epithelium. These organoids can be particularly useful for studying the mechanisms of intestinal tumors and to test (novel) drugs in vitro. Here, we describe our current laboratory protocols to generate and analyze intestinal tumors and organoids harboring APC and K-Ras double mutations.	
32499946        	Label-free redox imaging of patient-derived organoids using selective plane illumination microscopy.            	High-throughput drug screening of patient-derived organoids offers an attractive platform to determine cancer treatment efficacy. Here, selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) was used to determine treatment response in organoids with endogenous fluorescence from the metabolic coenzymes NAD(P)H and FAD. Rapid 3-D autofluorescence imaging of colorectal cancer organoids was achieved. A quantitative image analysis approach was developed to segment each organoid and quantify changes in endogenous fluorescence caused by treatment. Quantitative analysis of SPIM volumes confirmed the sensitivity of patient-derived organoids to standard therapies. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that SPIM is a powerful tool for high-throughput screening of organoid treatment response.                © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.	
29113809        	MIR21 Drives Resistance to Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibition in Cholangiocarcinoma.            	Cholangiocarcinomas (CCA) are resistant to chemotherapy, so new therapeutic agents are needed. We performed a screen to identify small-molecule compounds that are active against CCAs. Levels of microRNA 21 (MIR21 or miRNA21) are increased in CCAs. We investigated whether miRNA21 mediates resistance of CCA cells and organoids to HSP90 inhibitors.                We performed a high-throughput screen of 484 small-molecule compounds to identify those that reduced viability of 6 human CCA cell lines. We tested the effects of HSP90 inhibitors on cells with disruption of the MIR21 gene, cells incubated with MIR21 inhibitors, and stable cell lines with inducible expression of MIR21. We obtained CCA biopsies from patients, cultured them as organoids (patient-derived organoids). We assessed their architecture, mutation and gene expression patterns, response to compounds in culture, and when grown as subcutaneous xenograft tumors in mice.                Cells with IDH1 and PBRM1 mutations had the highest level of sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibitors. HSP90 inhibitors were effective in all cell lines, irrespective of mutations. Sensitivity of cells to HSP90 inhibitors correlated inversely with baseline level of MIR21. Disruption of MIR21 increased cell sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors. CCA cells that expressed transgenic MIR21 were more resistant to HSP90 inhibitors than cells transfected with control vectors; inactivation of MIR21 in these cells restored sensitivity to these agents. MIR21 was shown to target the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B5 (DNAJB5). Transgenic expression of DNAJB5 in CCA cells that overexpressed MIR21 re-sensitized them to HSP90 inhibitors. Sensitivity of patient-derived organoids to HSP90 inhibitors, in culture and when grown as xenograft tumors in mice, depended on expression of miRNA21.                miRNA21 appears to mediate resistance of CCA cells to HSP90 inhibitors by reducing levels of DNAJB5. HSP90 inhibitors might be developed for the treatment of CCA and miRNA21 might be a marker of sensitivity to these agents.                Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.	
24859528        	Oncogenic transformation of diverse gastrointestinal tissues in primary organoid culture.            	The application of primary organoid cultures containing epithelial and mesenchymal elements to cancer modeling holds promise for combining the accurate multilineage differentiation and physiology of in vivo systems with the facile in vitro manipulation of transformed cell lines. Here we used a single air-liquid interface culture method without modification to engineer oncogenic mutations into primary epithelial and mesenchymal organoids from mouse colon, stomach and pancreas. Pancreatic and gastric organoids exhibited dysplasia as a result of expression of Kras carrying the G12D mutation (Kras(G12D)), p53 loss or both and readily generated adenocarcinoma after in vivo transplantation. In contrast, primary colon organoids required combinatorial Apc, p53, Kras(G12D) and Smad4 mutations for progressive transformation to invasive adenocarcinoma-like histology in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, recapitulating multi-hit models of colorectal cancer (CRC), as compared to the more promiscuous transformation of small intestinal organoids. Colon organoid culture functionally validated the microRNA miR-483 as a dominant driver oncogene at the IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor-2) 11p15.5 CRC amplicon, inducing dysplasia in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. These studies demonstrate the general utility of a highly tractable primary organoid system for cancer modeling and driver oncogene validation in diverse gastrointestinal tissues.	
32905502        	Organoid models of glioblastoma: advances, applications and challenges.            	The high mortality and poor clinical prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are concerns for many GBM patients as well as clinicians and researchers. The lack of a preclinical model that can easily be established and accurately recapitulate tumour biology and the tumour microenvironment further complicates GBM research and its clinical translation. GBM organoids (GBOs) are promising high-fidelity models that can be applied to model the disease, develop drugs, establish a living biobank, mimic therapeutic responses and explore personalized therapy. However, GBO models face some challenges, including deficient immune responses, absent vascular system and controversial reliability. In recent years, considerable progress has been achieved in the improvement of brain tumour organoid models and research based on such models. In addition to the traditional cultivation method, these models can be cultivated via genetic engineering and co-culture of cerebral organoids and GBM. In this review, we summarize the applications of GBM organoids and related advances and provide our opinions on associated limitations and challenges.                AJCR Copyright © 2020.	
28916735        	Functional screening in human cardiac organoids reveals a metabolic mechanism for cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest.            	The mammalian heart undergoes maturation during postnatal life to meet the increased functional requirements of an adult. However, the key drivers of this process remain poorly defined. We are currently unable to recapitulate postnatal maturation in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs), limiting their potential as a model system to discover regenerative therapeutics. Here, we provide a summary of our studies, where we developed a 96-well device for functional screening in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac organoids (hCOs). Through interrogation of >10,000 organoids, we systematically optimize parameters, including extracellular matrix (ECM), metabolic substrate, and growth factor conditions, that enhance cardiac tissue viability, function, and maturation. Under optimized maturation conditions, functional and molecular characterization revealed that a switch to fatty acid metabolism was a central driver of cardiac maturation. Under these conditions, hPSC-CMs were refractory to mitogenic stimuli, and we found that key proliferation pathways including β-catenin and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) were repressed. This proliferative barrier imposed by fatty acid metabolism in hCOs could be rescued by simultaneous activation of both β-catenin and YAP1 using genetic approaches or a small molecule activating both pathways. These studies highlight that human organoids coupled with higher-throughput screening platforms have the potential to rapidly expand our knowledge of human biology and potentially unlock therapeutic strategies.	
32952734        	Organoids as Complex In Vitro Models for Studying Radiation-Induced Cell Recruitment.            	Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) typically receive chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. Although this treatment improves prognosis for most patients, some patients continue to experience recurrence within 5 years. Preclinical studies have shown that immune cell infiltration at the irradiated site may play a significant role in tumor cell recruitment; however, little is known about the mechanisms that govern this process. This lack of knowledge highlights the need to evaluate radiation-induced cell infiltration with models that have controllable variables and maintain biological integrity. Mammary organoids are multicellular three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models, and they have been used to examine many aspects of mammary development and tumorigenesis. Organoids are also emerging as a powerful tool to investigate normal tissue radiation damage. In this review, we evaluate recent advances in mammary organoid technology, consider the advantages of using organoids to study radiation response, and discuss future directions for the applications of this technique.                © Biomedical Engineering Society 2020.	
32891189        	Organoids Model Transcriptional Hallmarks of Oncogenic KRAS Activation in Lung Epithelial Progenitor Cells.            	Mutant KRAS is a common driver in epithelial cancers. Nevertheless, molecular changes occurring early after activation of oncogenic KRAS in epithelial cells remain poorly understood. We compared transcriptional changes at single-cell resolution after KRAS activation in four sample sets. In addition to patient samples and genetically engineered mouse models, we developed organoid systems from primary mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung epithelial cells to model early-stage lung adenocarcinoma. In all four settings, alveolar epithelial progenitor (AT2) cells expressing oncogenic KRAS had reduced expression of mature lineage identity genes. These findings demonstrate the utility of our in vitro organoid approaches for uncovering the early consequences of oncogenic KRAS expression. This resource provides an extensive collection of datasets and describes organoid tools to study the transcriptional and proteomic changes that distinguish normal epithelial progenitor cells from early-stage lung cancer, facilitating the search for targets for KRAS-driven tumors.

31130643        	Current Status of Patient-Derived Ovarian Cancer Models.            	Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the leading causes of female cancer death. Recent studies have documented its extensive variations as a disease entity, in terms of cell or tissue of origin, pre-cancerous lesions, common mutations, and therapeutic responses, leading to the notion that OC is a generic term referring to a whole range of different cancer subtypes. Despite such heterogeneity, OC treatment is stereotypic; aggressive surgery followed by conventional chemotherapy could result in chemo-resistant diseases. Whereas molecular-targeted therapies will become shortly available for a subset of OC, there still remain many patients without effective drugs, requiring development of groundbreaking therapeutic agents. In preclinical studies for drug discovery, cancer cell lines used to be the gold standard, but now this has declined due to frequent failure in predicting therapeutic responses in patients. In this regard, patient-derived cells and tumors are gaining more attention in precise and physiological modeling of in situ tumors, which could also pave the way to implementation of precision medicine. In this article, we comprehensively overviewed the current status of various platforms for patient-derived OC models. We highly appreciate the potentials of organoid culture in achieving high success rate and retaining tumor heterogeneity.	
30982469        	CEA expression heterogeneity and plasticity confer resistance to the CEA-targeting bispecific immunotherapy antibody cibisatamab (CEA-TCB) in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids.            	The T cell bispecific antibody cibisatamab (CEA-TCB) binds Carcino-Embryonic Antigen (CEA) on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells, which triggers T cell killing of cancer cell lines expressing moderate to high levels of CEA at the cell surface. Patient derived colorectal cancer organoids (PDOs) may more accurately represent patient tumors than established cell lines which potentially enables more detailed insights into mechanisms of cibisatamab resistance and sensitivity.                We established PDOs from multidrug-resistant metastatic CRCs. CEA expression of PDOs was determined by FACS and sensitivity to cibisatamab immunotherapy was assessed by co-culture of PDOs and allogeneic CD8 T cells.                PDOs could be categorized into 3 groups based on CEA cell-surface expression: CEAhi (n = 3), CEAlo (n = 1) and CEAmixed PDOs (n = 4), that stably maintained populations of CEAhi and CEAlo cells, which has not previously been described in CRC cell lines. CEAhi PDOs were sensitive whereas CEAlo PDOs showed resistance to cibisatamab. PDOs with mixed expression showed low sensitivity to cibisatamab, suggesting that CEAlo cells maintain cancer cell growth. Culture of FACS-sorted CEAhi and CEAlo cells from PDOs with mixed CEA expression demonstrated high plasticity of CEA expression, contributing to resistance acquisition through CEA antigen loss. RNA-sequencing revealed increased WNT/β-catenin pathway activity in CEAlo cells. Cell surface CEA expression was up-regulated by inhibitors of the WNT/β-catenin pathway.                Based on these preclinical findings, heterogeneity and plasticity of CEA expression appear to confer low cibisatamab sensitivity in PDOs, supporting further clinical evaluation of their predictive effect in CRC. Pharmacological inhibition of the WNT/β-catenin pathway may be a rational combination to sensitize CRCs to cibisatamab. Our novel PDO and T cell co-culture immunotherapy models enable pre-clinical discovery of candidate biomarkers and combination therapies that may inform and accelerate the development of immuno-oncology agents in the clinic.	
33210256        	Mammary Organoids and 3D Cell Cultures: Old Dogs with New Tricks.            	3D cell culture methods have been an integral part of and an essential tool for mammary gland and breast cancer research for half a century. In fact, mammary gland researchers, who discovered and deciphered the instructive role of extracellular matrix (ECM) in mammary epithelial cell functional differentiation and morphogenesis, were the pioneers of the 3D cell culture techniques, including organoid cultures. The last decade has brought a tremendous increase in the 3D cell culture techniques, including modifications and innovations of the existing techniques, novel biomaterials and matrices, new technological approaches, and increase in 3D culture complexity, accompanied by several redefinitions of the terms "3D cell culture" and "organoid". In this review, we provide an overview of the 3D cell culture and organoid techniques used in mammary gland biology and breast cancer research. We discuss their advantages, shortcomings and current challenges, highlight the recent progress in reconstructing the complex mammary gland microenvironment in vitro and ex vivo, and identify the missing 3D cell cultures, urgently needed to aid our understanding of mammary gland development, function, physiology, and disease, including breast cancer.	
32883604        	Intestinal stem cells and intestinal organoids.            	The intestinal epithelium is one of the most rapidly renewing tissues, which is fueled by stem cells at the base of the crypts. Strategies of genetic lineage tracing and organoids, which capture major features of original tissues, are powerful avenues for exploring the biology of intestinal stem cells in vivo and in vitro, respectively. The combination of intestinal organoid-culturing system and genetic modification approaches provides an attractive platform to uncover the mechanism of colorectal cancer and genetic disorders in the human minigut. Here, we will provide a comprehensive overview of studies on intestinal epithelium and intestinal stem cells. We will also review the applications of organoids and genetic markers in intestinal research studies. Furthermore, we will discuss the advantages and drawbacks of organoids as disease models compared with mice models and cell lines.

32328818        	Human Colon Organoids and Other Laboratory Strategies to Enhance Patient Treatment Selection.            	Though many advancements in personalized medicine have been made, better methods are still needed to predict treatment benefit for patients with colorectal cancer. Patient-derived cancer organoids (PDCOs) are a major advance towards true personalization of treatment strategies. A growing body of literature is demonstrating the feasibility of PDCOs as an accurate and high-throughput preclinical tool for patient treatment selection. Many studies demonstrate that these cultures are readily generated and represent the tumors they were derived from phenotypically and based on their mutation profile. This includes maintenance of the driver muatations giving the cancer cells a selective growth advantage, and also heterogeneity, including molecular and metabolic heterogeneity. Additionally, PDCOs are now being utilized to develop patient biospecimen repositories, perform high to moderate-throughput drug screening, and to potentially predict treatment response for individual patients that are undergoing anti-cancer treatments. In order to develop PDCOs as a true clinical tool, further studies are required to determine the reproducibility and accuracy of these models to predict patient response.	
31746148        	A critical look: Challenges in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells into desired cell types and organoids.            	Too many choices can be problematic. This is certainly the case for human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs): they harbor the potential to differentiate into hundreds of cell types; yet it is highly challenging to exclusively differentiate hPSCs into a single desired cell type. This review focuses on unresolved and fundamental questions regarding hPSC differentiation and critiquing the identity and purity of the resultant cell populations. These are timely issues in view of the fact that hPSC-derived cell populations have or are being transplanted into patients in over 30 ongoing clinical trials. While many in vitro differentiation protocols purport to "mimic development," the exact number and identity of intermediate steps that a pluripotent cell takes to differentiate into a given cell type in vivo remains largely unknown. Consequently, most differentiation efforts inevitably generate a heterogeneous cellular population, as revealed by single-cell RNA-sequencing and other analyses. The presence of unwanted cell types in differentiated hPSC populations does not portend well for transplantation therapies. This provides an impetus to precisely control differentiation to desired ends-for instance, by logically blocking the formation of unwanted cell types or by overexpressing lineage-specifying transcription factors-or by harnessing technologies to selectively purify desired cell types. Conversely, approaches to differentiate three-dimensional "organoids" from hPSCs intentionally generate heterogeneous cell populations. While this is intended to mimic the rich cellular diversity of developing tissues, whether all such organoids are spatially organized in a manner akin to native organs (and thus, whether they fully qualify as organoids) remains to be fully resolved.

32429403        	Knockout of MMP3 Weakens Solid Tumor Organoids and Cancer Extracellular Vesicles.            	The tumor organoid (tumoroid) model in three-dimensional (3D) culture systems has been developed to reflect more closely the in vivo tumors than 2D-cultured tumor cells. Notably, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are efficiently collectible from the culture supernatant of gel-free tumoroids. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 3 is a multi-functional factor playing crucial roles in tumor progression. However, roles of MMP3 within tumor growth and EVs have not unveiled. Here, we investigated the protumorigenic roles of MMP3 on integrities of tumoroids and EVs. We generated MMP3-knockout (KO) cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system from rapidly metastatic LuM1 tumor cells. Moreover, we established fluorescent cell lines with palmitoylation signal-fused fluorescent proteins (tdTomato and enhanced GFP). Then we confirmed the exchange of EVs between cellular populations and tumoroids. LuM1-tumoroids released large EVs (200-1000 nm) and small EVs (50-200 nm) while the knockout of MMP3 resulted in the additional release of broken EVs from tumoroids. The loss of MMP3 led to a significant reduction in tumoroid size and the development of the necrotic area within tumoroids. MMP3 and CD9 (a category-1 EV marker tetraspanin protein) were significantly down-regulated in MMP3-KO cells and their EV fraction. Moreover, CD63, another member of the tetraspanin family, was significantly reduced only in the EVs fractions of the MMP3-KO cells compared to their counterpart. These weakened phenotypes of MMP3-KO were markedly rescued by the addition of MMP3-rich EVs or conditioned medium (CM) collected from LuM1-tumoroids, which caused a dramatic rise in the expression of MMP3, CD9, and Ki-67 (a marker of proliferating cells) in the MMP3-null/CD9-low tumoroids. Notably, MMP3 enriched in tumoroids-derived EVs and CM deeply penetrated recipient MMP3-KO tumoroids, resulting in a remarkable enlargement of solid tumoroids, while MMP3-null EVs did not. These data demonstrate that EVs can mediate molecular transfer of MMP3, resulting in increasing the proliferation and tumorigenesis, indicating crucial roles of MMP3 in tumor progression.	
32297954        	Modeling glioblastoma invasion using human brain organoids and single-cell transcriptomics.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) consists of devastating neoplasms with high invasive capacity, which have been difficult to study in vitro in a human-derived model system. Therapeutic progress is also limited by cellular heterogeneity within and between tumors, among other factors such as therapy resistance. To address these challenges, we present an experimental model using human cerebral organoids as a scaffold for patient-derived GBM cell invasion.                This study combined tissue clearing and confocal microscopy with single-cell RNA sequencing of GBM cells before and after co-culture with organoid cells.                We show that tumor cells within organoids extend a network of long microtubes, recapitulating the in vivo behavior of GBM. Transcriptional changes implicated in the invasion process are coherent across patient samples, indicating that GBM cells reactively upregulate genes required for their dispersion. Potential interactions between GBM and organoid cells identified by an in silico receptor-ligand pairing screen suggest functional therapeutic targets.                Taken together, our model has proven useful for studying GBM invasion and transcriptional heterogeneity in vitro, with applications for both pharmacological screens and patient-specific treatment selection on a time scale amenable to clinical practice.                © The Author(s) 2020.

28983454        	Organoid and Organ-On-A-Chip Systems: New Paradigms for Modeling Neurological and Gastrointestinal Disease.            	The modeling of biological processes in vitro provides an important tool to better understand mechanisms of development and disease, allowing for the rapid testing of therapeutics. However, a critical constraint in traditional monolayer culture systems is the absence of the multicellularity, spatial organization, and overall microenvironment present in vivo. This limitation has resulted in numerous therapeutics showing efficacy in vitro, but failing in patient trials. In this review, we discuss several organoid and "organ-on-a-chip" systems with particular regard to the modeling of neurological diseases and gastrointestinal disorders.                Recently, the in vitro generation of multicellular organ-like structures, coined organoids, has allowed the modeling of human development, tissue architecture, and disease with human-specific pathophysiology. Additionally, microfluidic "organ-on-a-chip" technologies add another level of physiological mimicry by allowing biological mediums to be shuttled through 3D cultures.                Organoids and organ-chips are rapidly evolving in vitro platforms which hold great promise for the modeling of development and disease.	
31685994        	CD9 identifies pancreatic cancer stem cells and modulates glutamine metabolism to fuel tumour growth.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) shows great cellular heterogeneity, with pronounced epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cell populations. However, the cellular hierarchy underlying PDAC cell diversity is unknown. Here we identify the tetraspanin CD9 as a marker of PDAC tumour-initiating cells. CD9high cells had increased organoid formation capability, and generated tumour grafts in vivo at limiting dilutions. Tumours initiated from CD9high cells recapitulated the cellular heterogeneity of primary PDAC, whereas CD9low cells produced only duct-like epithelial progeny. CD9 knockdown decreased the growth of PDAC organoids, and heterozygous CD9 deletion in Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KRasG12D; p53F/F mice prolonged overall survival. Mechanistically, CD9 promoted the plasma membrane localization of the glutamine transporter ASCT2, enhancing glutamine uptake in PDAC cells. Thus, our study identifies a PDAC subpopulation capable of initiating PDAC and giving rise to PDAC heterogeneity, suggesting that the cellular diversity of PDAC is generated by PDAC stem cell differentiation.

32971322        	Aspirin Rescues Wnt-Driven Stem-like Phenotype in Human Intestinal Organoids and Increases the Wnt Antagonist Dickkopf-1.            	Aspirin reduces colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality. Understanding the biology responsible for this protective effect is key to developing biomarker-led approaches for rational clinical use. Wnt signaling drives CRC development from initiation to progression through regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell populations. Here, we investigated whether aspirin can rescue these proinvasive phenotypes associated with CRC progression in Wnt-driven human and mouse intestinal organoids.                We evaluated aspirin-mediated effects on phenotype and stem cell markers in intestinal organoids derived from mouse (ApcMin/+ and Apcflox/flox) and human familial adenomatous polyposis patients. CRC cell lines (HCT116 and Colo205) were used to study effects on motility, invasion, Wnt signaling, and EMT.                Aspirin rescues the Wnt-driven cystic organoid phenotype by promoting budding in mouse and human Apc deficient organoids, which is paralleled by decreased stem cell marker expression. Aspirin-mediated Wnt inhibition in ApcMin/+ mice is associated with EMT inhibition and decreased cell migration, invasion, and motility in CRC cell lines. Chemical Wnt activation induces EMT and stem-like alterations in CRC cells, which are rescued by aspirin. Aspirin increases expression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 in CRC cells and organoids derived from familial adenomatous polyposis patients, which contributes to EMT and cancer stem cell inhibition.                We provide evidence of phenotypic biomarkers of response to aspirin with an increased epithelial and reduced stem-like state mediated by an increase in Dickkopf-1. This highlights a novel mechanism of aspirin-mediated Wnt inhibition and potential phenotypic and molecular biomarkers for trials.                Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

30096312        	Divergent Routes toward Wnt and R-spondin Niche Independency during Human Gastric Carcinogenesis.            	Recent sequencing analyses have shed light on heterogeneous patterns of genomic aberrations in human gastric cancers (GCs). To explore how individual genetic events translate into cancer phenotypes, we established a biological library consisting of genetically engineered gastric organoids carrying various GC mutations and 37 patient-derived organoid lines, including rare genomically stable GCs. Phenotype analyses of GC organoids revealed divergent genetic and epigenetic routes to gain Wnt and R-spondin niche independency. An unbiased phenotype-based genetic screening identified a significant association between CDH1/TP53 compound mutations and the R-spondin independency that was functionally validated by CRISPR-based knockout. Xenografting of GC organoids further established the feasibility of Wnt-targeting therapy for Wnt-dependent GCs. Our results collectively demonstrate that multifaceted genetic abnormalities render human GCs independent of the stem cell niche and highlight the validity of the genotype-phenotype screening strategy in gaining deeper understanding of human cancers.

32390556        	Functional genomics analysis of human colon organoids identifies key transcription factors.            	Organoids are a valuable three-dimensional (3D) model to study the differentiated functions of the human intestinal epithelium. They are a particularly powerful tool to measure epithelial transport processes in health and disease. Though biological assays such as organoid swelling and intraluminal pH measurements are well established, their underlying functional genomics are not well characterized. Here we combine genome-wide analysis of open chromatin by ATAC-Seq with transcriptome mapping by RNA-Seq to define the genomic signature of human intestinal organoids (HIOs). These data provide an important tool for investigating key physiological and biochemical processes in the intestinal epithelium. We next compared the transcriptome and open chromatin profiles of HIOs with equivalent data sets from the Caco2 colorectal carcinoma line, which is an important two-dimensional (2D) model of the intestinal epithelium. Our results define common features of the intestinal epithelium in HIO and Caco2 and further illustrate the cancer-associated program of the cell line. Generation of Caco2 cysts enabled interrogation of the molecular divergence of the 2D and 3D cultures. Overrepresented motif analysis of open chromatin peaks identified caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) as a key activating transcription factor in HIO, but not in monolayer cultures of Caco2. However, the CDX2 motif becomes overrepresented in open chromatin from Caco2 cysts, reinforcing the importance of this factor in intestinal epithelial differentiation and function. Intersection of the HIO and Caco2 transcriptomes further showed functional overlap in pathways of ion transport and tight junction integrity, among others. These data contribute to understanding human intestinal organoid biology.	
28967525        	[Progress in prostate cancer study: 3D cell culture enables the ex vivo reproduction of tumor characteristics].            	Despite new therapeutics options, Prostate Cancer (PCa) remains a public health challenge because of its high incidence and mortality. Limits in PCa research come from the lack of in vitro and in vivo models that mimic the human disease. Currently, 2D in vitro tissue culture models of PCa are widely used but they present numerous limits. They do not reproduce cellular morphology, tissue architecture, inter-patients and intratumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, they lack two key components of PCa tumors, the tumoral microenvironment and the cancer stem cells. In vivo murine models of PCa cannot be representative of all the genetic alterations known in prostate tumors and they hardly reproduce the pathophysiology of human metastatic progression. Consequently, the physiology of these in vitro and in vivo models do not well represent patients tumors. 3D cell cultures overcome many of these limits by sharing morphologic characteristics with in vivo tumors as well as reproducibility of in vitro models. 3D models of PCa include spheroids derived from tumor cell lines, and organoids, derived from patient. In 3D cell cultures, cell fitness is maintained, the physiological cells-cells and cell-matrix interactions are restored and an extracellular matrix surrounds the cells. Organoids, generated from PCa primary tumors or metastases, allow studies on cancer stem cells and their microenvironment. Moreover, organoids retain genetic integrity of PCa tumors. PCa organoid model is an innovative tool that offers great perspectives of therapeutic screening. In the future, organoids generated from patients' biopsies may also lead to personalized medicine.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	
31439856        	Immunoevolution of mouse pancreatic organoid isografts from preinvasive to metastatic disease.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment, which is contributed by the complex interaction between cancer cells and a heterogeneous population of stromal cells. Therefore, facile and trackable models are needed for integrative and dynamic interrogation of cancer-stroma interaction. Here, we tracked the immunoevolution of PDA in a genetically-defined transplantable model of mouse pancreatic tumour organoids that recapitulates the progression of the disease from early preinvasive lesions to metastatic carcinomas. We demonstrated that organoid-derived isografts (ODI) can be used as a biological source of biomarkers (NT5E, TGFB1, FN1, and ITGA5) of aggressive molecular subtypes of human PDA. In ODI, infiltration from leukocytes is an early event during progression of the disease as observed for autochthonous models. Neoplastic progression was associated to accumulation of Maf+ macrophages, which inversely correlated with CD8+ T cells infiltration. Consistently, levels of MAF were enriched in human PDA subtypes characterized by abundance of macrophage-related transcripts and indicated poor patients' survival. Density of MAF+ macrophages was higher in human PDA tissues compared to preinvasive lesions. Our results suggest that ODIs represent a suitable system for genotypic-immunophenotypic studies and support the hypothesis of MAF+ macrophages as a prominent immunosuppressive population in PDA.	
31692873        	Esophageal 3D organoids of MPV17-/- mouse model of mitochondrial DNA depletion show epithelial cell plasticity and telomere attrition.            	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive cancer with late-stage detection and poor prognosis. This emphasizes the need to identify new markers for early diagnosis and treatment. Altered mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) content in primary tumors correlates with poor patient prognosis. Here we used three-dimensional (3D) organoids of esophageal epithelial cells (EECs) from the MPV17-/- mouse model of mtDNA depletion to investigate the contribution of reduced mtDNA content in ESCC oncogenicity. To test if mtDNA defects are a contributing factor in ESCC, we used oncogenic stimuli such as ESCC carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO) treatment, or expressing p53R175H oncogenic driver mutation. We observed that EECs and 3D-organoids with mtDNA depletion had cellular, morphological and genetic alterations typical of an oncogenic transition. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction induced cellular transformation is accompanied by elevated mitochondrial fission protein, DRP1 and pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial fission by mDivi-1 in the MPV17-/- organoids reversed the phenotype to that of normal EEC organoids. Our studies show that mtDNA copy number depletion, activates a mitochondrial retrograde response, potentiates telomere defects, and increases the oncogenic susceptibility towards ESCC. Furthermore, mtDNA depletion driven cellular plasticity is mediated via altered mitochondrial fission-fusion dynamics.	
30930950        	Pancreatic Progenitors and Organoids as a Prerequisite to Model Pancreatic Diseases and Cancer.            	Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are characterized by their unique capacity to stepwise differentiate towards any particular cell type in an adult organism. Pluripotent stem cells provide a beneficial platform to model hereditary diseases and even cancer development. While the incidence of pancreatic diseases such as diabetes and pancreatitis is increasing, the understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of particular diseases remains limited. Only a few recent publications have contributed to the characterization of human pancreatic development in the fetal stage. Hence, most knowledge of pancreatic specification is based on murine embryology. Optimizing and understanding current in vitro protocols for pancreatic differentiation of ESCs and iPSCs constitutes a prerequisite to generate functional pancreatic cells for better disease modeling and drug discovery. Moreover, human pancreatic organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells, organ-restricted stem cells, and tumor samples provide a powerful technology to model carcinogenesis and hereditary diseases independent of genetically engineered mouse models. Herein, we summarize recent advances in directed differentiation of pancreatic organoids comprising endocrine cell types. Beyond that, we illustrate up-and-coming applications for organoid-based platforms.	
24997189        	Robust circadian rhythms in organoid cultures from PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE mouse small intestine.            	Disruption of circadian rhythms is a risk factor for several human gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, ranging from diarrhea to ulcers to cancer. Four-dimensional tissue culture models that faithfully mimic the circadian clock of the GI epithelium would provide an invaluable tool to understand circadian regulation of GI health and disease. We hypothesized that rhythmicity of a key circadian component, PERIOD2 (PER2), would diminish along a continuum from ex vivo intestinal organoids (epithelial 'miniguts'), nontransformed mouse small intestinal epithelial (MSIE) cells and transformed human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells. Here, we show that bioluminescent jejunal explants from PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) mice displayed robust circadian rhythms for >72 hours post-excision. Circadian rhythms in primary or passaged PER2::LUC jejunal organoids were similarly robust; they also synchronized upon serum shock and persisted beyond 2 weeks in culture. Remarkably, unshocked organoids autonomously synchronized rhythms within 12 hours of recording. The onset of this autonomous synchronization was slowed by >2 hours in the presence of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 (20 μM). Doubling standard concentrations of the organoid growth factors EGF, Noggin and R-spondin enhanced PER2 oscillations, whereas subtraction of these factors individually at 24 hours following serum shock produced no detectable effects on PER2 oscillations. Growth factor pulses induced modest phase delays in unshocked, but not serum-shocked, organoids. Circadian oscillations of PER2::LUC bioluminescence aligned with Per2 mRNA expression upon analysis using quantitative PCR. Concordant findings of robust circadian rhythms in bioluminescent jejunal explants and organoids provide further evidence for a peripheral clock that is intrinsic to the intestinal epithelium. The rhythmic and organotypic features of organoids should offer unprecedented advantages as a resource for elucidating the role of circadian rhythms in GI stem cell dynamics, epithelial homeostasis and disease.                 © 2014.

31879153        	Organoid and Assembloid Technologies for Investigating Cellular Crosstalk in Human Brain Development and Disease.            	The biology of the human brain, and in particular the dynamic interactions between the numerous cell types and regions of the central nervous system, has been difficult to study due to limited access to functional brain tissue. Technologies to derive brain organoids and assembloids from human pluripotent stem cells are increasingly utilized to model, in progressively complex preparations, the crosstalk between cell types in development and disease. Here, we review the use of these human cellular models to study cell-cell interactions among progenitors, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, cancer cells, and non-central nervous system cell types, as well as efforts to study connectivity between brain regions following controlled assembly of organoids. Ultimately, the promise of these patient-derived preparations is to uncover previously inaccessible features of brain function that emerge from complex cell-cell interactions and to improve our mechanistic understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Changes in the proteome can serve as a biomarker of cancer or lead to the development of a targeted therapy. This minireview will focus on mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies applied specifically to colorectal cancer, particularly the variety of cancer model systems used, including tumor samples, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures such as spheroids and organoids. A thorough discussion of the application of these systems will accompany the review of the literature, as each provides distinct advantages and disadvantages for colorectal cancer research. Finally, we provide conclusions and future perspectives for the application of these model systems to cancer research as a whole.                Copyright © 2020 Lindhorst and Hummon.	
32355905        	CEREBRAL ORGANOIDS AS A MODEL FOR GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME.            	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly lethal and elusive cancer. While many in vitro and in vivo models have been developed to recapitulate the factors that contribute to its invasive behavior, they suffer from drawbacks related to genetic variability, expense and scope. Technologies utilizing human pluripotent stem cells can now generate organoids which can recapitulate the relative complexity the cytoarchitecture and microenvironment of human brain tissue. In conjunction with protocols which effectively induce GBM tumors within these "cerebral organoids", such approaches represent an unprecedented model to investigate GBM invasion and its effect on the brain ECM. This review focuses on methods of brain organoid development, protocols for inducing GBM, the relevant findings on invasion and microenvironmental changes, and discusses their limitations and potential future direction.	
33364198        	Glioblastoma Organoids: Pre-Clinical Applications and Challenges in the Context of Immunotherapy.            	Malignant brain tumors remain uniformly fatal, even with the best-to-date treatment. For Glioblastoma (GBM), the most severe form of brain cancer in adults, the median overall survival is roughly over a year. New therapeutic options are urgently needed, yet recent clinical trials in the field have been largely disappointing. This is partially due to inappropriate preclinical model systems, which do not reflect the complexity of patient tumors. Furthermore, clinically relevant patient-derived models recapitulating the immune compartment are lacking, which represents a bottleneck for adequate immunotherapy testing. Emerging 3D organoid cultures offer innovative possibilities for cancer modeling. Here, we review available GBM organoid models amenable to a large variety of pre-clinical applications including functional bioassays such as proliferation and invasion, drug screening, and the generation of patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) for validation of biological responses in vivo. We emphasize advantages and technical challenges in establishing immunocompetent ex vivo models based on co-cultures of GBM organoids and human immune cells. The latter can be isolated either from the tumor or from patient or donor blood as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also discuss the challenges to generate GBM PDOXs based on humanized mouse models to validate efficacy of immunotherapies in vivo. A detailed characterization of such models at the cellular and molecular level is needed to understand the potential and limitations for various immune activating strategies. Increasing the availability of immunocompetent GBM models will improve research on emerging immune therapeutic approaches against aggressive brain cancer.

26811335        	Analysis of Immune Cells from Human Mammary Ductal Epithelial Organoids Reveals Vδ2+ T Cells That Efficiently Target Breast Carcinoma Cells in the Presence of Bisphosphonate.            	Developing strategies to enhance cancer prevention is a paramount goal, particularly given recent concerns about surgical treatment of preinvasive states such as ductal carcinoma in situ. Promoting effective immunosurveillance by leukocytes that scan for nascent neoplastic transformations represents a potential means to achieve this goal. Because most breast cancers arise within the ductal epithelium, enhancing protective immunosurveillance will likely necessitate targeting one or more of the distinctive lymphocyte types found in these sites under normal conditions. Here, we have characterized the intraepithelial lymphocyte compartment of non-cancerous human breast tissue and identified a subset of T lymphocytes that can be pharmacologically targeted to enhance their responses to breast cancer cells. Specifically, Vδ2(+) γδ T cells were consistently present in preparations of mammary ductal epithelial organoids and they proliferated in response to zoledronic acid, an aminobisphosphonate drug. Vδ2(+) T cells from breast ductal organoids produced the antitumor cytokine IFNγ and efficiently killed bisphosphonate-pulsed breast carcinoma cells. These findings demonstrate the potential for exploiting the ability of Vδ2(+) γδ T cells to respond to FDA-approved bisphosphonate drugs as a novel immunotherapeutic approach to inhibit the outgrowth of breast cancers.                ©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32741653        	Cerebral organoids to unravel the mechanisms underlying malformations of human cortical development.            	Genetic studies identified multiple mutations associated with malformations of cortical development (MCD) in humans. When analyzing the underlying mechanisms in non-human experimental models it became increasingly evident, that these mutations accumulate in genes, which functions evolutionary progressed from rodents to humans resulting in an incomplete reflection of the molecular and cellular alterations in these models. Human brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells resemble early aspects of human brain development to a remarkable extent making them an attractive model to investigate MCD. Here we review how human brain organoids enable the generation of fundamental new insight about the underlying pathomechanisms of MCD. We show how phenotypic features of these diseases are reflected in human brain organoids and discuss challenges and future considerations but also limitations for the use of human brain organoids to model human brain development and associated disorders.

29298292        	Imaging organoids: a bright future ahead.            	Organogenesis, tissue homeostasis and organ function involve complex spatial cellular organization and tissue dynamics.

Organoids, three-dimensional (3D) stem cell cultures that self-organize into ex vivo 'mini-organs', now open a new window onto cellular processes within tissue. Light microscopy is a powerful approach to probe the cellular complexity that can be modeled with organoids. This combination of tools is already leading to exciting synergies in stem cell and cancer research.	
33602919        	Patient-derived xenografts and organoids model therapy response in prostate cancer.            	Therapy resistance and metastatic processes in prostate cancer (PCa) remain undefined, due to lack of experimental models that mimic different disease stages. We describe an androgen-dependent PCa patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model from treatment-naïve, soft tissue metastasis (PNPCa). RNA and whole-exome sequencing of the PDX tissue and organoids confirmed transcriptomic and genomic similarity to primary tumor. PNPCa harbors BRCA2 and CHD1 somatic mutations, shows an SPOP/FOXA1-like transcriptomic signature and microsatellite instability, which occurs in 3% of advanced PCa and has never been modeled in vivo. Comparison of the treatment-naïve PNPCa with additional metastatic PDXs (BM18, LAPC9), in a medium-throughput organoid screen of FDA-approved compounds, revealed differential drug sensitivities. Multikinase inhibitors (ponatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib) were broadly effective on all PDX- and patient-derived organoids from advanced cases with acquired resistance to standard-of-care compounds. This proof-of-principle study may provide a preclinical tool to screen drug responses to standard-of-care and newly identified, repurposed compounds.

32654925        	Organoid Models of Tumor Immunology.            	Cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly govern cancer progression and drug response. The efficacy of clinical immunotherapies has fostered an exponential interest in the tumor immune microenvironment, which in turn has engendered a pressing need for robust experimental systems modeling patient-specific tumor-immune interactions. Traditional 2D in vitro tumor immunotherapy models have reconstituted immortalized cancer cell lines with immune components, often from peripheral blood. However, newly developed 3D in vitro organoid culture methods now allow the routine culture of primary human tumor biopsies and increasingly incorporate immune components. Here, we present a viewpoint on recent advances, and propose translational applications of tumor organoids for immuno-oncology research, immunotherapy modeling, and precision medicine.

28331002        	Personalized In Vitro and In Vivo Cancer Models to Guide Precision Medicine.            	Precision medicine is an approach that takes into account the influence of individuals' genes, environment, and lifestyle exposures to tailor interventions. Here, we describe the development of a robust precision cancer care platform that integrates whole-exome sequencing with a living biobank that enables high-throughput drug screens on patient-derived tumor organoids. To date, 56 tumor-derived organoid cultures and 19 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been established from the 769 patients enrolled in an Institutional Review Board-approved clinical trial. Because genomics alone was insufficient to identify therapeutic options for the majority of patients with advanced disease, we used high-throughput drug screening to discover effective treatment strategies. Analysis of tumor-derived cells from four cases, two uterine malignancies and two colon cancers, identified effective drugs and drug combinations that were subsequently validated using 3-D cultures and PDX models. This platform thereby promotes the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that can be assessed in clinical trials and provides personalized therapeutic options for individual patients where standard clinical options have been exhausted.Significance: Integration of genomic data with drug screening from personalized in vitro and in vivo cancer models guides precision cancer care and fuels next-generation research.

28321286        	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated heterozygous knockout of the autism gene CHD8 and characterization of its transcriptional networks in cerebral organoids derived from iPS cells.            	CHD8 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8), which codes for a member of the CHD family of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors, is one of the most commonly mutated genes in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) identified in exome-sequencing studies. Loss of function mutations in the gene have also been found in schizophrenia (SZ) and intellectual disabilities and influence cancer cell proliferation. We previously reported an RNA-seq analysis carried out on neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and monolayer neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that were heterozygous for CHD8 knockout (KO) alleles generated using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. A significant number of ASD and SZ candidate genes were among those that were differentially expressed in a comparison of heterozygous KO lines (CHD8+/-) vs isogenic controls (CHD8+/-), including the SZ and bipolar disorder (BD) candidate gene TCF4, which was markedly upregulated in CHD8+/- neuronal cells.                In the current study, RNA-seq was carried out on CHD8+/- and isogenic control (CHD8+/+) cerebral organoids, which are 3-dimensional structures derived from iPS cells that model the developing human telencephalon.                TCF4 expression was, again, significantly upregulated. Pathway analysis carried out on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed an enrichment of genes involved in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, forebrain development, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and axonal guidance, similar to our previous study on NPCs and monolayer neurons. There was also significant overlap in our CHD8+/- DEGs with those found in a transcriptome analysis carried out by another group using cerebral organoids derived from a family with idiopathic ASD. Remarkably, the top DEG in our respective studies was the non-coding RNA DLX6-AS1, which was markedly upregulated in both studies; DLX6-AS1 regulates the expression of members of the DLX (distal-less homeobox) gene family. DLX1 was also upregulated in both studies. DLX genes code for transcription factors that play a key role in GABAergic interneuron differentiation. Significant overlap was also found in a transcriptome study carried out by another group using iPS cell-derived neurons from patients with BD, a condition characterized by dysregulated WNT/β-catenin signaling in a subgroup of affected individuals.                Overall, the findings show that distinct ASD, SZ, and BD candidate genes converge on common molecular targets-an important consideration for developing novel therapeutics in genetically heterogeneous complex traits.	
27656116        	Organoids as a Model for Colorectal Cancer.            	Modelling human diseases in in vitro systems is undisputedly an invaluable research tool, yet there are many limitations. Some of those limitations have been overcome through the introduction of organoid culture systems, which have revolutionised colorectal cancer research and enabled an array of new experimental techniques. This 3D system models the physiology, shape, dynamics and cell make-up of the intestinal epithelium producing a relevant and highly adaptable model system. The increased functional relevance of this model compared to the use of 2D cancer cell lines makes it an invaluable tool for both basic and translational research. As the limitations of this system are being overcome to make high-throughput assays possible, it is clear that organoids are becoming a mainstay of colorectal cancer research. This review aims to explore the advantages and limitations of this system and discusses the future directions enabled by this model.	
32106218        	Mutational signature in colorectal cancer caused by genotoxic pks+ E. coli.            	Various species of the intestinal microbiota have been associated with the development of colorectal cancer1,2, but it has not been demonstrated that bacteria have a direct role in the occurrence of oncogenic mutations. Escherichia coli can carry the pathogenicity island pks, which encodes a set of enzymes that synthesize colibactin3. This compound is believed to alkylate DNA on adenine residues4,5 and induces double-strand breaks in cultured cells3. Here we expose human intestinal organoids to genotoxic pks+ E. coli by repeated luminal injection over five months. Whole-genome sequencing of clonal organoids before and after this exposure revealed a distinct mutational signature that was absent from organoids injected with isogenic pks-mutant bacteria. The same mutational signature was detected in a subset of 5,876 human cancer genomes from two independent cohorts, predominantly in colorectal cancer. Our study describes a distinct mutational signature in colorectal cancer and implies that the underlying mutational process results directly from past exposure to bacteria carrying the colibactin-producing pks pathogenicity island.

33571486        	Identification of novel human Wnt target genes using adult endodermal tissue-derived organoids.            	Canonical Wnt signaling plays a key role during organ development, homeostasis and regeneration and these processes are conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. Mutations in Wnt pathway components are commonly found in various types of cancer. Upon activation of canonical Wnt signaling, β-catenin binds in the nucleus to members of the TCF-LEF family and activates the transcription of target genes. Multiple Wnt target genes, including Lgr5/LGR5 and Axin2/AXIN2, have been identified in mouse models and human cancer cell lines. Here we set out to identify the transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling in five human tissues using organoid technology. Organoids are derived from adult stem cells and recapitulate the functionality as well as the structure of the original tissue. Since the Wnt pathway is critical to maintain the organoids from the human intestine, colon, liver, pancreas and stomach, organoid technology allows us to assess Wnt target gene expression in a human wildtype situation. We performed bulk mRNA sequencing of organoids immediately after inhibition of Wnt pathway and identified 41 genes as commonly regulated genes in these tissues. We also identified large numbers of target genes specific to each tissue. One of the shared target genes is TEAD4, a transcription factor driving expression of YAP/TAZ signaling target genes. In addition to TEAD4, we identified a variety of genes which encode for proteins that are involved in Wnt-independent pathways, implicating the possibility of direct crosstalk between Wnt signaling and other pathways. Collectively, this study identified tissue-specific and common Wnt target gene signatures and provides evidence for a conserved role for these Wnt targets in different tissues.

29560127        	Neoadjuvant photodynamic therapy augments immediate and prolonged oxaliplatin efficacy in metastatic pancreatic cancer organoids.            	Effective treatment of advanced metastatic disease remains the primary challenge in the management of inoperable pancreatic cancer. Current therapies such as oxaliplatin (OxPt)-based chemotherapy regimens (FOLFIRINOX) provide modest short-term survival improvements, yet with significant toxicity. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a light-activated cancer therapy, demonstrated clinical promise for pancreatic cancer treatment and enhances conventional chemotherapies with non-overlapping toxicities. This study investigates the capacity of neoadjuvant PDT using a clinically-approved photosensitizer, benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD, verteporfin), to enhance OxPt efficacy in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Treatment effects were evaluated in organotypic three-dimensional (3D) cultures, clinically representative models that bridge the gap between conventional cell cultures and in vivo models. The temporally-spaced, multiparametric analyses demonstrated a superior efficacy for combined PDT+OxPt compared to each monotherapy alone, which was recapitulated on different organotypic pancreatic cancer cultures. The therapeutic benefit of neoadjuvant PDT to OxPt chemotherapy materialized in a time-dependent manner, reducing residual viable tissue and tumor viability in a manner not achievable with OxPt or PDT alone. These findings emphasize the need for intelligent combination therapies and relevant models to evaluate the temporal kinetics of interactions between mechanistically-distinct treatments and highlight the promise of PDT as a neoadjuvant treatment for disseminated pancreatic cancer.	
32884042        	Towards personalized induction therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma: organoids derived from endoscopic biopsy recapitulate the pre-treatment tumor.            	Esophageal adenocarcinoma has few known recurrent mutations and therefore robust, reliable and reproducible patient-specific models are needed for personalized treatment. Patient-derived organoid culture is a strategy that may allow for the personalized study of esophageal adenocarcinoma and the development of personalized induction therapy. We therefore developed a protocol to establish EAC organoids from endoscopic biopsies of naïve esophageal adenocarcinomas. Histologic characterization and molecular characterization of organoids by whole exome sequencing demonstrated recapitulation of the tumors' histology and genomic (~ 60% SNV overlap) characteristics. Drug testing using clinically appropriate chemotherapeutics and targeted therapeutics showed an overlap between the patient's tumor response and the corresponding organoids' response. Furthermore, we identified Barrett's esophagus epithelium as a potential source of organoid culture contamination. In conclusion, organoids can be robustly cultured from endoscopic biopsies of esophageal adenocarcinoma and recapitulate the originating tumor. This model demonstrates promise as a tool to better personalize therapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma patients.	
33009951        	Patient-derived organoids and orthotopic xenografts of primary and recurrent gliomas represent relevant patient avatars for precision oncology.            	Patient-based cancer models are essential tools for studying tumor biology and for the assessment of drug responses in a translational context. We report the establishment a large cohort of unique organoids and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) of various glioma subtypes, including gliomas with mutations in IDH1, and paired longitudinal PDOX from primary and recurrent tumors of the same patient. We show that glioma PDOXs enable long-term propagation of patient tumors and represent clinically relevant patient avatars that retain histopathological, genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features of parental tumors. We find no evidence of mouse-specific clonal evolution in glioma PDOXs. Our cohort captures individual molecular genotypes for precision medicine including mutations in IDH1, ATRX, TP53, MDM2/4, amplification of EGFR, PDGFRA, MET, CDK4/6, MDM2/4, and deletion of CDKN2A/B, PTCH, and PTEN. Matched longitudinal PDOX recapitulate the limited genetic evolution of gliomas observed in patients following treatment. At the histological level, we observe increased vascularization in the rat host as compared to mice. PDOX-derived standardized glioma organoids are amenable to high-throughput drug screens that can be validated in mice. We show clinically relevant responses to temozolomide (TMZ) and to targeted treatments, such as EGFR and CDK4/6 inhibitors in (epi)genetically defined subgroups, according to MGMT promoter and EGFR/CDK status, respectively. Dianhydrogalactitol (VAL-083), a promising bifunctional alkylating agent in the current clinical trial, displayed high therapeutic efficacy, and was able to overcome TMZ resistance in glioblastoma. Our work underscores the clinical relevance of glioma organoids and PDOX models for translational research and personalized treatment studies and represents a unique publicly available resource for precision oncology.	
32677979        	Modeling neoplastic disease with spheroids and organoids.            	Cancer is a complex disease in which both genetic defects and microenvironmental components contribute to the development, progression, and metastasization of disease, representing major hurdles in the identification of more effective and safer treatment regimens for patients. Three-dimensional (3D) models are changing the paradigm of preclinical cancer research as they more closely resemble the complex tissue environment and architecture found in clinical tumors than in bidimensional (2D) cell cultures. Among 3D models, spheroids and organoids represent the most versatile and promising models in that they are capable of recapitulating the heterogeneity and pathophysiology of human cancers and of filling the gap between conventional 2D in vitro testing and animal models. Such 3D systems represent a powerful tool for studying cancer biology, enabling us to model the dynamic evolution of neoplastic disease from the early stages to metastatic dissemination and the interactions with the microenvironment. Spheroids and organoids have recently been used in the field of drug discovery and personalized medicine. The combined use of 3D models could potentially improve the robustness and reliability of preclinical research data, reducing the need for animal testing and favoring their transition to clinical practice. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the use of these 3D systems for cancer modeling, focusing on their innovative translational applications, looking at future challenges, and comparing them with most widely used animal models.	
33145915        	Human pluripotent stem cell-derived lung organoids: Potential applications in development and disease modeling.            	The pulmonary system is comprised of two main compartments, airways and alveolar space. Their tissue and cellular complexity ensure lung function and protection from external agents, for example, virus. Two-dimensional (2D) in vitro systems and animal models have been largely employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying human lung development, physiology, and pathogenesis. However, neither of these models accurately recapitulate the human lung environment and cellular crosstalk. More recently, human-derived three-dimensional (3D) models have been generated allowing for a deeper understanding of cell-to-cell communication. However, the availability and accessibility of primary human cell sources from which generate the 2D and 3D models may be limited. In the past few years, protocols have been developed to successfully employ human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and differentiate them toward pulmonary fate in vitro. In the present review, we discuss the advantages and pitfalls of hPSC-derived lung 2D and 3D models, including the main characteristics and potentials for these models and their current and future applications for modeling development and diseases. Lung organoids currently represent the closest model to the human pulmonary system. We further focus on the applications of lung organoids for the study of human diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, infectious diseases, and lung cancer. Finally, we discuss the present limitations and potential future applications of 3D lung organoids.

32373607        	Organoid Models of Glioblastoma to Study Brain Tumor Stem Cells.            	Glioblastoma represents an aggressive form of brain cancer characterized by poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of only 3-7%. Despite remarkable advances in brain tumor research in the past decades, very little has changed for patients, due in part to the recurrent nature of the disease and to the lack of suitable models to perform genotype-phenotype association studies and personalized drug screening. In vitro culture of cancer cells derived from patient biopsies has been fundamental in understanding tumor biology and for testing the effect of various drugs. These cultures emphasize the role of in vitro cancer stem cells (CSCs), which fuel tumor growth and are thought to be the cause of relapse after treatment. However, it has become clear over the years that a 2D monolayer culture of these CSCs has certain disadvantages, including the lack of heterogeneous cell-cell and cell-environment interactions, which can now be partially overcome by the introduction of 3D organoid cultures. This is a novel and expanding field of research and in this review, I describe the emerging 3D models of glioblastoma. I also discuss their potential to advance our knowledge of tumor biology and CSC heterogeneity, while debating their current limitations.                Copyright © 2020 Azzarelli.	
33234163        	Definitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from human embryonic stem cells through serum/feeder-free organoid-induced differentiation.            	Ex vivo production of hematopoietic stem/precursor cells (HSPCs) represents a promising versatile approach for blood disorders.                To derive definitive HSPCs from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we differentiated mesodermally specified embryoid bodies (EBs) on gelatin-coated plates in serum/feeder-free conditions.                Seven-day EB maturation followed by an 8-day differentiation period on OP9 cells provided the highest number of definitive (CD34+ CD235a-, 69%, p < 0.01) and lowest number of primitive (CD34- CD235a+, 1.55%, p < 0.01) precursor cells along with the highest colony-forming units (149.8 ± 11.6, p < 0.01) in feeder-free conditions. Maximal HSPC fraction (CD34+ CD38- CD45RA- CD49f+ CD90+) was 7.6-8.9% after 10 days of hematopoietic differentiation with 14.5% adult β-globin expression following RBC differentiation. Myeloid and erythroid colonies were restricted strictly to the CD34+ CD43+ fraction (370.5 ± 65.7, p < 0.001), while the CD34- CD43+ fraction produced only a small number of colonies (21.6 ± 11.9). In addition, we differentiated the CD34+ CD43+ cells towards T-lymphocytes using the OP9/DLL1 co-culture system demonstrating double-positive T cells (CD4+ CD8+) with CD3+ expression displaying a broad T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Confocal imaging of organoid-like structures revealed a close association of CD31+ cells with CD34+ and CD43+ cells, suggesting a potential emergence of HSPCs through endothelial to hematopoietic transition. Furthermore, fluorescently labeled organoids exhibited the emergence of spherical non-attached cells from rare progenitors at the border of the organoid center.                In summary, definitive HSPCs can be derived from ESCs through a dynamic cellular process from an organoid-like structure, where erythroid progeny are capable of producing adult hemoglobin and lymphoid progeny shows a diverse TCR repertoire.	
26406451        	Integrin-specific hydrogels as adaptable tumor organoids for malignant B and T cells.            	Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders of B and T cell origin that are treated with chemotherapy drugs with variable success rate that has virtually not changed over decades. Although new classes of chemotherapy-free epigenetic and metabolic drugs have emerged, durable responses to these conventional and new therapies are achieved in a fraction of cancer patients, with many individuals experiencing resistance to the drugs. The paucity in our understanding of what regulates the drug resistance phenotype and establishing a predictive indicator is, in great part, due to the lack of adequate ex vivo lymphoma models to accurately study the effect of microenvironmental cues in which malignant B and T cell lymphoma cells arise and reside. Unlike many other tumors, lymphomas have been neglected from biomaterials-based microenvironment engineering standpoint. In this study, we demonstrate that B and T cell lymphomas have different pro-survival integrin signaling requirements (αvβ3 and α4β1) and the presence of supporting follicular dendritic cells are critical for enhanced proliferation in three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments. We engineered adaptable 3D tumor organoids presenting adhesive peptides with distinct integrin specificities to B and T cell lymphoma cells that resulted in enhanced proliferation, clustering, and drug resistance to the chemotherapeutics and a new class of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), Panobinostat. In Diffuse Large B cell Lymphomas, the 3D microenvironment upregulated the expression level of B cell receptor (BCR), which supported the survival of B cell lymphomas through a tyrosine kinase Syk in the upstream BCR pathway. Our integrin specific ligand functionalized 3D organoids mimic a lymphoid neoplasm-like heterogeneous microenvironment that could, in the long term, change the understanding of the initiation and progression of hematological tumors, allow primary biospecimen analysis, provide prognostic values, and importantly, allow a faster and more rational screening and translation of therapeutic regimens.

32098630        	Long-term expansion, genomic stability and in vivo safety of adult human pancreas organoids.            	Pancreatic organoid systems have recently been described for the in vitro culture of pancreatic ductal cells from mouse and human. Mouse pancreatic organoids exhibit unlimited expansion potential, while previously reported human pancreas organoid (hPO) cultures do not expand efficiently long-term in a chemically defined, serum-free medium. We sought to generate a 3D culture system for long-term expansion of human pancreas ductal cells as hPOs to serve as the basis for studies of human pancreas ductal epithelium, exocrine pancreatic diseases and the development of a genomically stable replacement cell therapy for diabetes mellitus.                Our chemically defined, serum-free, human pancreas organoid culture medium supports the generation and expansion of hPOs with high efficiency from both fresh and cryopreserved primary tissue. hPOs can be expanded from a single cell, enabling their genetic manipulation and generation of clonal cultures. hPOs expanded for months in vitro maintain their ductal morphology, biomarker expression and chromosomal integrity. Xenografts of hPOs survive long-term in vivo when transplanted into the pancreas of immunodeficient mice. Notably, mouse orthotopic transplants show no signs of tumorigenicity. Crucially, our medium also supports the establishment and expansion of hPOs in a chemically defined, modifiable and scalable, biomimetic hydrogel.                hPOs can be expanded long-term, from both fresh and cryopreserved human pancreas tissue in a chemically defined, serum-free medium with no detectable tumorigenicity. hPOs can be clonally expanded, genetically manipulated and are amenable to culture in a chemically defined hydrogel. hPOs therefore represent an abundant source of pancreas ductal cells that retain the characteristics of the tissue-of-origin, which opens up avenues for modelling diseases of the ductal epithelium and increasing understanding of human pancreas exocrine biology as well as for potentially producing insulin-secreting cells for the treatment of diabetes.	
32228120        	In Situ Expansion, Differentiation, and Electromechanical Coupling of Human Cardiac Muscle in a 3D Bioprinted, Chambered Organoid.            	One goal of cardiac tissue engineering is the generation of a living, human pump in vitro that could replace animal models and eventually serve as an in vivo therapeutic. Models that replicate the geometrically complex structure of the heart, harboring chambers and large vessels with soft biomaterials, can be achieved using 3-dimensional bioprinting. Yet, inclusion of contiguous, living muscle to support pump function has not been achieved. This is largely due to the challenge of attaining high densities of cardiomyocytes-a notoriously nonproliferative cell type. An alternative strategy is to print with human induced pluripotent stem cells, which can proliferate to high densities and fill tissue spaces, and subsequently differentiate them into cardiomyocytes in situ.                To develop a bioink capable of promoting human induced pluripotent stem cell proliferation and cardiomyocyte differentiation to 3-dimensionally print electromechanically functional, chambered organoids composed of contiguous cardiac muscle.                We optimized a photo-crosslinkable formulation of native ECM (extracellular matrix) proteins and used this bioink to 3-dimensionally print human induced pluripotent stem cell-laden structures with 2 chambers and a vessel inlet and outlet. After human induced pluripotent stem cells proliferated to a sufficient density, we differentiated the cells within the structure and demonstrated function of the resultant human chambered muscle pump. Human chambered muscle pumps demonstrated macroscale beating and continuous action potential propagation with responsiveness to drugs and pacing. The connected chambers allowed for perfusion and enabled replication of pressure/volume relationships fundamental to the study of heart function and remodeling with health and disease.                This advance represents a critical step toward generating macroscale tissues, akin to aggregate-based organoids, but with the critical advantage of harboring geometric structures essential to the pump function of cardiac muscle. Looking forward, human chambered organoids of this type might also serve as a test bed for cardiac medical devices and eventually lead to therapeutic tissue grafting.	
33327494        	Combinatorial Effect of Magnetic Field and Radiotherapy in PDAC Organoids: A Pilot Study.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly refractory to systemic treatment, including radiotherapy (RT) either as alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided RT is a novel treatment technique which conjugates the high MR imaging contrast resolution to the possibility of re-adapting treatment plan to daily anatomical variations. Magnetic field (MF) might exert a biological effect that could be exploited to enhance radiation effect. The aim of the present study was to lay the preclinical basis of the MF effect by exploring how it modifies the response to radiation in organoid cultures established from PDAC. The short-term effect of radiation, alone or in combination with MF, was evaluated in patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and monolayer cell cultures. Cell viability, apoptotic cell death, and organoid size following exposure to the treatment were evaluated. PDOs demonstrated limited sensitivity at clinically relevant doses of radiation. The combination of radiation and MF demonstrated superior efficacy than monotherapy in almost all the PDOs tested. PDOs treated with combination of radiation and MF were significantly smaller in size and some showed increased cell death as compared to the monotherapy with radiation. Long-time exposure to 1.5T MF can increase the therapeutic efficacy of radiation in PDAC organoids.	
21384249        	Microgravity assay of neuroblastoma: in vitro aggregation kinetics and organoid morphology correlate with MYCN expression.            	Neuroblastoma, the most common and deadly solid pediatric tumor, features genetic and biologic heterogeneity that defies simple risk assessments, drives diverse clinical behavior, and demands more extensive characterization. This research served to investigate the utility of a microgravity assay-rotary bioreactor culture-to evaluate and characterize the cell-specific, in vitro behavior of neuroblastoma cell lines: aggregation kinetics of single cells and the morphology of the formed structures, called organoids. Specifically, we examined the effect of amplification of the oncogene MYCN, a genetic factor that is strongly associated with poor clinical outcome. Three human neuroblastoma cell lines with varied MYCN expression (CHP-212 (unamplified), SK-N-AS (unamplified), IMR-32 (amplified)) were cultured in the microgravity rotary bioreactor. Simple aggregation kinetics were determined by periodically performing counts of non-aggregated single cells in the media. Organoids were harvested, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated microscopically in terms of size and shape. The MYCN-amplified cell line (IMR32) aggregated much more rapidly than the unamplified cell lines, as indicated by a significantly lower area under its aggregation curve (single non-aggregated cells vs. time): IMR32=4.3, CHP-212 =12.4, SK-N-AS=9.8 (adhesion index ×10(5)). Further, the organoid morphology of the MYCN-amplified cell line was noticeably different compared to the unamplified lines. The CHP-212 and SK-N-AS cells formed spherical structures with average cross-sectional area 0.213 and 0.138 mm(2), respectively, and featured an outer viable zone of cells (average length of 0.175, 0.129 mm, respectively; the "diffusion distance"), surrounding an inner necrotic core. In contrast, the MYCN-amplified cell line formed a large single mass of cells but had a similar diffusion distance (0.175 mm). This microgravity assay provides a rapid, reproducible assessment of in vitro behavior of neuroblastoma, and the measured parameters, aggregation kinetics and organoid size and shape correlated with malignant potential in terms of MYCN amplification. This assay allows for the examination of cell-specific biologic and genetic factors that should provide valuable insight into the clinical behavior of neuroblastoma.                © The Society for In Vitro Biology 2011	
33458620        	Vitamin D sufficiency enhances differentiation of patient-derived prostate epithelial organoids.            	Vitamin D is an essential steroid hormone that regulates systemic calcium homeostasis and cell fate decisions. The prostate gland is hormonally regulated, requiring steroids for proliferation and differentiation of secretory luminal cells. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of lethal prostate cancer, which exhibits a dedifferentiated pathology, linking vitamin D sufficiency to epithelial differentiation. To determine vitamin D regulation of prostatic epithelial differentiation, patient-derived benign prostate epithelial organoids were grown in vitamin D-deficient or -sufficient conditions. Organoids were assessed by phenotype and single-cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistic validation demonstrated that vitamin D sufficiency promoted organoid growth and accelerated differentiation by inhibiting canonical Wnt activity and suppressing Wnt family member DKK3. Wnt and DKK3 were also reduced by vitamin D in prostate tissue explants by spatial transcriptomics. Wnt dysregulation is a known contributor to aggressive prostate cancer, thus findings further link vitamin D deficiency to lethal disease.                © 2020 The Author(s).	
33092060        	Patient-Derived Xenograft vs. Organoids: A Preliminary Analysis of Cancer Research Output, Funding and Human Health Impact in 2014-2019.            	Cancer remains a major threat to mortality and morbidity globally, despite intense research and generous funding. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models-where tumor biopsies are injected into an animal-were developed to improve the predictive capacity of preclinical animal models. However, recent observations have called into question the clinical relevance, and therefore the translational accuracy, of these. Patient-derived organoids (PDO) use patient tumor samples to create in vitro models that maintain aspects of tumor structure and heterogeneity. We undertook a preliminary analysis of the number of breast, colorectal, and lung cancer research studies using PDX or PDO published worldwide between 2014-2019. We looked for evidence of impacts of this research on human health. The number of publications that focused on PDO is gradually increasing over time, but is still very low compared to publications using PDX models. Support for new research projects using PDO is gradually increasing, a promising indicator of a shift towards more human-relevant approaches to understanding human disease. Overall, increases in total funding for these three major cancer types does not appear to be translating to any consequential increase in outputs, defined for this purpose as publications associated with clinical trials. With increasing public discomfort in research using animals and demands for 'alternative' methods, it is timely to consider how to implement non-animal methods more effectively.	
33579816        	Crenolanib Regulates ERK and AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways in RAS/BRAF-Mutated Colorectal Cancer Cells and Organoids.            	Recently developed molecularly targeted therapies such as EGFR inhibitors have notably improved the prognosis of patients with cancer. However, patients with KRAS and BRAF mutations do not currently benefit from these therapies. Here, we aimed to examine potential effects of crenolanib as a new molecularly targeted therapy in colorectal cancer. We used multiple colorectal cancer cell lines to investigate the growth-inhibitory effect of crenolanib and its effect in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Primary cultures of patient-derived organoids (PDO), a model that reflects the heterogeneity of clinical colorectal cancer, were used to further validate the effects of crenolanib. Unlike cetuximab, crenolanib remarkably suppressed ERK and AKT/mTOR pathways in HT29 cells with BRAF mutation and in HCT116 cells with KRAS mutation with corresponding growth-suppressing effects. Additive or synergistic effects were observed in treatments with combination of crenolanib and other cytotoxic drugs. Moreover, crenolanib suppressed the expression of stem cell markers, such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2. These observations were substantiated in seven PDOs with KRAS mutation and two PDOs without KRAS/BRAF mutations, with crenolanib suppressing the growth of all PDOs regardless of their KRAS mutation status. Furthermore, crenolanib abrogated PDGF- and TGFβ-induced increase of OCT4-positive cells in PDOs. Together, these findings suggest that crenolanib may have clinical utility for patients with colorectal cancer, especially patients with KRAS/BRAF mutations. IMPLICATIONS: These findings indicate that crenolanib can be a useful target agent for patients with colorectal cancer, especially patients with KRAS/BRAF mutations.                ©2021 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32553164        	Patient-Derived Ovarian Cancer Organoids Mimic Clinical Response and Exhibit Heterogeneous Inter- and Intrapatient Drug Responses.            	There remains an unmet need for preclinical models to enable personalized therapy for ovarian cancer (OC) patients. Here we evaluate the capacity of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to predict clinical drug response and functional consequences of tumor heterogeneity. We included 36 whole-genome-characterized PDOs from 23 OC patients with known clinical histories. OC PDOs maintain the genomic features of the original tumor lesion and recapitulate patient response to neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel combination treatment. PDOs display inter- and intrapatient drug response heterogeneity to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, which can be partially explained by genetic aberrations. PDO drug screening identifies high responsiveness to at least one drug for 88% of patients. PDOs are valuable preclinical models that can provide insights into drug response for individual patients with OC, complementary to genetic testing. Generating PDOs of multiple tumor locations can improve clinical decision making and increase our knowledge of genetic and drug response heterogeneity.                Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32145468        	A Novel Organoid Model of Damage and Repair Identifies HNF4α as a Critical Regulator of Intestinal Epithelial Regeneration.            	Recent evidence has suggested that the intact intestinal epithelial barrier protects our body from a range of immune-mediated diseases. The epithelial layer has an impressive ability to reconstitute and repair upon damage and this process of repair increasingly is seen as a therapeutic target. In vitro models to study this process in primary intestinal cells are lacking.                We established and characterized an in vitro model of intestinal damage and repair by applying γ-radiation on small-intestinal organoids. We then used this model to identify novel regulators of intestinal regeneration.                We identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) as a pivotal upstream regulator of the intestinal regenerative response. Organoids lacking Hnf4a were not able to propagate in vitro. Importantly, intestinal Hnf4a knock-out mice showed impaired regeneration after whole-body irradiation, confirming intestinal organoids as a valuable alternative to in vivo studies.                In conclusion, we established and validated an in vitro damage-repair model and identified HNF4α as a crucial regulator of intestinal regeneration.

28459450        	Transplantation of engineered organoids enables rapid generation of metastatic mouse models of colorectal cancer.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of death in the developed world, yet facile preclinical models that mimic the natural stages of CRC progression are lacking. Through the orthotopic engraftment of colon organoids we describe a broadly usable immunocompetent CRC model that recapitulates the entire adenoma-adenocarcinoma-metastasis axis in vivo. The engraftment procedure takes less than 5 minutes, shows efficient tumor engraftment in two-thirds of mice, and can be achieved using organoids derived from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), wild-type organoids engineered ex vivo, or from patient-derived human CRC organoids. In this model, we describe the genotype and time-dependent progression of CRCs from adenocarcinoma (6 weeks), to local disseminated disease (11-12 weeks), and spontaneous metastasis (>20 weeks). Further, we use the system to show that loss of dysregulated Wnt signaling is critical for the progression of disseminated CRCs. Thus, our approach provides a fast and flexible means to produce tailored CRC mouse models for genetic studies and pre-clinical investigation.	
30111276        	Generation of renewable mouse intestinal epithelial cell monolayers and organoids for functional analyses.            	Conditional reprogramming has enabled the development of long-lived, normal epithelial cell lines from mice and humans by in vitro culture with ROCK inhibitor on a feeder layer. We applied this technology to mouse small intestine to create 2D mouse intestinal epithelial monolayers (IEC monolayers) from genetic mouse models for functional analysis.                IEC monolayers form epithelial colonies that proliferate on a feeder cell layer and are able to maintain their genotype over long-term passage. IEC monolayers form 3D spheroids in matrigel culture and monolayers on transwell inserts making them useful for functional analyses. IEC monolayers derived from the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mouse model CFTR ∆F508 fail to respond to CFTR activator forskolin in 3D matrigel culture as measured by spheroid swelling and transwell monolayer culture via Ussing chamber electrophysiology. Tumor IEC monolayers generated from the ApcMin/+ mouse intestinal cancer model grow more quickly than wild-type (WT) IEC monolayers both on feeders and as spheroids in matrigel culture.                These results indicate that generation of IEC monolayers is a useful model system for growing large numbers of genotype-specific mouse intestinal epithelial cells that may be used in functional studies to examine molecular mechanisms of disease and to identify and assess novel therapeutic compounds.	
32537685        	Current status and perspectives of patient-derived rare cancer models.            	Malignancies with extremely low incidences, such as less than 6 per 100,000 people annually, are defined as rare cancers. Approximately 200 malignancies are classified in this category, therefore the total number of patients with rare cancers is greater than that of patients with any single common cancer. However, because of the small numbers of patients, novel therapies have not been developed for individual rare cancers, and clinical outcomes remain dismal. Patient-derived cancer models are indispensable for both basic and pre-clinical studies, and their roles will increase in the era of post-genome medicine. Although patient-derived cancer models have long been used in oncology, they are not well developed for rare cancers. In the context of sarcoma, the presently available cell lines and xenograft models are limited and do not satisfy the needs of research. Indeed, the lack of effective therapies for rare cancers might be attributable to the paucity of adequate patient-derived cancer models for pre-clinical studies. To facilitate the establishment and availability of patient-derived rare cancer models, we need to create effective methods for model establishment, share the valuable clinical samples and established models, and implement guidelines to record the clinical data of donor patients and original tumors. Patient-derived rare cancer models are a public resource, and they should not be used exclusively but should rather be shared among the research community.	
28468934        	A genome editing approach to study cancer stem cells in human tumors.            	The analysis of stem cell hierarchies in human cancers has been hampered by the impossibility of identifying or tracking tumor cell populations in an intact environment. To overcome this limitation, we devised a strategy based on editing the genomes of patient-derived tumor organoids using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to integrate reporter cassettes at desired marker genes. As proof of concept, we engineered human colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids that carry EGFP and lineage-tracing cassettes knocked in the LGR5 locus. Analysis of LGR5-EGFP+ cells isolated from organoid-derived xenografts demonstrated that these cells express a gene program similar to that of normal intestinal stem cells and that they propagate the disease to recipient mice very efficiently. Lineage-tracing experiments showed that LGR5+ CRC cells self-renew and generate progeny over long time periods that undergo differentiation toward mucosecreting- and absorptive-like phenotypes. These genetic experiments confirm that human CRCs adopt a hierarchical organization reminiscent of that of the normal colonic epithelium. The strategy described herein may have broad applications to study cell heterogeneity in human tumors.                © 2017 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.	
31835877        	Glucose Depletion Enhances the Stem Cell Phenotype and Gemcitabine Resistance of Cholangiocarcinoma Organoids through AKT Phosphorylation and Reactive Oxygen Species.            	Cancer cells are strongly dependent on the glycolytic pathway for generation of energy even under aerobic condition through a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Rapid proliferation of cancer cells is often accompanied by high glucose consumption and abnormal angiogenesis, which may lead to glucose depletion. In the present study, we investigated how cholangiocarcinoma cells adapt to glucose depletion using a 3D organoid culture system. We cultured organoids derived from cholangiocarcinoma under glucose-free condition and investigated cell proliferation, expression of stem cell markers and resistance to gemcitabine. Cholangiocarcinoma organoids cultured under glucose-free condition showed reduced proliferation but were able to survive. We also observed an increase in the expression of stem cell markers including LGR5 and enhancement of stem cell phenotypic characteristics such as resistance to gemcitabine through AKT phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species. These findings indicate that cholangiocarcinoma cells are able to adapt to glucose depletion through enhancement of their stem cell phenotype in response to changes in microenvironmental conditions.	
24050233        	Modeling colorectal cancer as a 3-dimensional disease in a dish: the case for drug screening using organoids, zebrafish, and fruit flies.            	This review discusses recent shifts in the understanding of colorectal cancer as a stem cell based disease, based on findings that tie patient prognosis to the presence of cancer stem cells in colorectal tumors. Currently no drugs specifically target CSCs in colorectal tumors. However, recent advances in the culturing of colorectal stem cells using mammalian organoids, zebrafish, and Drosophila offer promising avenues for anti-CSC drug discovery.	
31593010        	Biphenotypic Differentiation of Pancreatic Cancer in 3-Dimensional Culture.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Improved characterized models of PDAC are needed for drug screening.                We grew 4 established pancreatic cancer cell lines in hanging drop cultures to produce spheroids. We also grew organoids from explanted xenografted PDAC and surgically resected primary PDAC. We performed transmission and scanning electron microscopy and compared findings with those of the normal pancreatic duct. We also performed single-cell cloning to determine the potential options for differentiation.                Spheroids contained tight junctions and desmosomes but lacked zymogen granules, as expected. The former features were present in normal pancreatic duct but absent from PDAC cell lines grown in standard 2-dimensional culture. Spheroids functionally excluded macromolecules in whole mounts. Cells on the surface of PDAC spheroids were carpeted by microvilli except for rare cells with prominent stereocilia. Carpets of microvilli were also seen in low passage organoids produced from xenografts and surgically resected human PDAC, in addition to normal human pancreatic duct. We performed single-cell cloning and resulting spheroids produced both cell phenotypes at the same approximate ratios as those from bulk cultures.                Pancreatic cancer spheroids/organoids are capable of biphenotypic differentiation.	
27110583        	Fbxw7-associated drug resistance is reversed by induction of terminal differentiation in murine intestinal organoid culture.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the top three cancer-related causes of death worldwide. FBXW7 is a known tumor-suppressor gene, commonly mutated in CRC and in a variety of other epithelial tumors. Low expression of FBXW7 is also associated with poor prognosis. Loss of FBXW7 sensitizes cancer cells to certain drugs, while making them more resistant to other types of chemotherapies. However, is not fully understood how epithelial cells within normal gut and primary tumors respond to potential cancer therapeutics. We have studied genetically engineered mice in which the fbxw7 gene is conditionally knocked-out in the intestine (fbxw7(∆G)). To further investigate the mechanism of Fbxw7-action, we grew intestinal crypts from floxed-fbxw7 (fbxw7(fl/fl)) and fbxw7(ΔG) mice, in a Matrigel-based organoid (mini-gut) culture. The fbxw7(ΔG) organoids exhibited rapid budding events in the crypt region. Furthermore, to test organoids for drug response, we exposed day 3 intestinal organoids from fbxw7(fl/fl) and fbxw7(∆G) mice, to various concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for 72 hours. 5-FU triggers phenotypic differences in organoids including changing shape, survival, resistance, and death. 5-FU however, rescues the drug-resistance phenotype of fbxw7(ΔG) through the induction of terminal differentiation. Our results support the hypothesis that a differentiating therapy successfully targets FBXW7-mutated CRC cells.	
33459870        	Lung organoids: advances in generation and 3D-visualization.            	The lung is comprised of more than 40 distinct cell types that support a complex 3-dimensional (3D) architecture that is required for efficient lung function. Loss of this proper architecture can accommodate and promote lung disease, highlighting researchers' growing need to analyze lung structures in detail. Additionally, in vivo cellular and molecular response to chemical and physical signals, along with the recapitulation of gene-expression patterns, can be lost during the transition from complex 3D tissues to 2D cell culture systems. Therefore, technologies that allow for the investigation of lung function under normal and disease states utilizing the entirety of the lung architecture are required to generate a complete understanding of these processes. Airway cell-derived organoids that can recapitulate lung structure and function ex vivo while being amenable to experimental manipulation, have provided a new and exciting model system to investigate lung biology. In this perspective, we discuss emerging technologies for culturing lung-derived organoids, techniques to visualize organoids using high-resolution microscopy and the resulting information extracted from organoids supporting research focused on lung function and diseases.	
30465020        	NHE8 Deficiency Promotes Colitis-Associated Cancer in Mice via Expansion of Lgr5-Expressing Cells.            	Lgr5 overexpression has been detected in colorectal cancers (CRCs), including some cases of colitis-associated CRCs. In colitis-associated CRCs, chronic inflammation is a contributing factor in carcinogenesis. We recently reported that intestinal Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 8 (NHE8) plays an important role in intestinal mucosal protection and that loss of NHE8 expression results in an ulcerative colitis-like condition. Therefore, we hypothesized that NHE8 may be involved in the development of intestinal tumors.                We assessed NHE8 expression in human CRCs by immunohistochemistry and studied tumor burden in NHE8 knockout (KO) mice using an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate colon cancer model. We also evaluated cell proliferation in HT29NHE8KO cells and assessed tumor growth in NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice xenografted with HT29NHE8KO cells. To verify if a relationship exists between Lgr5 and NHE8 expression, we analyzed Lgr5 expression in NHE8KO mice by polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. Lgr5 expression and cell proliferation in the absence of NHE8 were confirmed in colonic organoid cultures. The expression of β-catenin and c-Myc also were analyzed to evaluate Wnt/β-catenin activation.                NHE8 was undetectable in human CRC tissues. Although only 9% of NHE8 wild-type mice showed tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate colon cancer model, almost 10 times more NHE8KO mice (89%) developed tumors. In the absence of NHE8, a higher colony formation unit was discovered in HT29NHE8KO cells. In NSG mice, larger tumors developed at the site where HT29NHE8KO cells were injected compared with HT29NHE8 wild type cells. Furthermore, NHE8 deficiency resulted in increased Lgr5 expression in the colon, in HT29-derived tumors, and in colonoids. The absence of NHE8 also increased Wnt/β-catenin activation.                NHE8 might be an intrinsic factor that regulates Wnt/β-catenin in the intestine.	
27782124        	Wnt and Neuregulin1/ErbB signalling extends 3D culture of hormone responsive mammary organoids.            	The development of in vitro culture systems quantitatively and qualitatively recapitulating normal breast biology is key to the understanding of mammary gland biology. Current three-dimensional mammary culture systems have not demonstrated concurrent proliferation and functional differentiation ex vivo in any system for longer than 2 weeks. Here, we identify conditions including Neuregulin1 and R-spondin 1, allowing maintenance and expansion of mammary organoids for 2.5 months in culture. The organoids comprise distinct basal and luminal compartments complete with functional steroid receptors and stem/progenitor cells able to reconstitute a complete mammary gland in vivo. Alternative conditions are also described that promote enrichment of basal cells organized into multiple layers surrounding a keratinous core, reminiscent of structures observed in MMTV-Wnt1 tumours. These conditions comprise a unique tool that should further understanding of normal mammary gland development, the molecular mechanism of hormone action and signalling events whose deregulation leads to breast tumourigenesis.	
27713700        	Drug Discovery via Human-Derived Stem Cell Organoids.            	Patient-derived cell lines and animal models have proven invaluable for the understanding of human intestinal diseases and for drug development although both inherently comprise disadvantages and caveats. Many genetically determined intestinal diseases occur in specific tissue microenvironments that are not adequately modeled by monolayer cell culture. Likewise, animal models incompletely recapitulate the complex pathologies of intestinal diseases of humans and fall short in predicting the effects of candidate drugs. Patient-derived stem cell organoids are new and effective models for the development of novel targeted therapies. With the use of intestinal organoids from patients with inherited diseases, the potency and toxicity of drug candidates can be evaluated better. Moreover, owing to the novel clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein-9 genome-editing technologies, researchers can use organoids to precisely modulate human genetic status and identify pathogenesis-related genes of intestinal diseases. Therefore, here we discuss how patient-derived organoids should be grown and how advanced genome-editing tools may be applied to research on modeling of cancer and infectious diseases. We also highlight practical applications of organoids ranging from basic studies to drug screening and precision medicine.	
32550913        	Aurora-A/SOX8/FOXK1 signaling axis promotes chemoresistance via suppression of cell senescence and induction of glucose metabolism in ovarian cancer organoids and cells.            	Rationale: Cisplatin derivatives are first-line chemotherapeutic agents for epithelial ovarian cancer. However, chemoresistance remains a major hurdle for successful therapy and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood at present. Methods: RNA sequencing of organoids (PDO) established from cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer tissue samples was performed. Glucose metabolism, cell senescence, and chemosensitivity properties were subsequently examined. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, Fӧrster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging (FRET-FLIM), luciferase reporter assay, ChIP and animal experiments were conducted to gain insights into the specific functions and mechanisms of action of the serine/threonine kinase, Aurora-A, in ovarian cancer. Results: Aurora-A levels were significantly enhanced in cisplatin-resistant PDO. Furthermore, Aurora-A promoted chemoresistance through suppression of cell senescence and induction of glucose metabolism in ovarian cancer organoids and cells. Mechanistically, Aurora-A bound directly to the transcription factor sex determining region Y-box 8 (SOX8) and phosphorylated the Ser327 site, in turn, regulating genes related to cell senescence and glycolysis, including hTERT, P16, LDHA and HK2, through enhancement of forkhead-box k1 (FOXK1) expression. Conclusions: Aurora-A regulates cell senescence and glucose metabolism to induce cisplatin resistance by participating in the SOX8/FOXK1 signaling axis in ovarian cancer. Our collective findings highlight a novel mechanism of cisplatin resistance and present potential therapeutic targets to overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.                © The author(s).	
26317980        	Three Dimensional Culture of Human Renal Cell Carcinoma Organoids.            	Renal cell carcinomas arise from the nephron but are heterogeneous in disease biology, clinical behavior, prognosis, and response to systemic therapy. Development of patient-specific in vitro models that efficiently and faithfully reproduce the in vivo phenotype may provide a means to develop personalized therapies for this diverse carcinoma. Studies to maintain and model tumor phenotypes in vitro were conducted with emerging three-dimensional culture techniques and natural scaffolding materials. Human renal cell carcinomas were individually characterized by histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative PCR to establish the characteristics of each tumor. Isolated cells were cultured on renal extracellular matrix and compared to a novel polysaccharide scaffold to assess cell-scaffold interactions, development of organoids, and maintenance of gene expression signatures over time in culture. Renal cell carcinomas cultured on renal extracellular matrix repopulated tubules or vessel lumens in renal pyramids and medullary rays, but cells were not observed in glomeruli or outer cortical regions of the scaffold. In the polysaccharide scaffold, renal cell carcinomas formed aggregates that were loosely attached to the scaffold or free-floating within the matrix. Molecular analysis of cell-scaffold constructs including immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR demonstrated that individual tumor phenotypes could be sustained for up to 21 days in culture on both scaffolds, and in comparison to outcomes in two-dimensional monolayer cultures. The use of three-dimensional scaffolds to engineer a personalized in vitro renal cell carcinoma model provides opportunities to advance understanding of this disease.	
32728094        	Current concepts in tumour-derived organoids.            	Cancer comprises a collection of highly proliferative and heterogeneous cells growing within an adaptive and evolving tumour microenvironment. Cancer survival rates have significantly improved following decades of cancer research. However, many experimental and preclinical studies do not translate to the bedside, reflecting the challenges of modelling the complexities and multicellular basis of human disease. Organoids are novel, complex, three-dimensional ex vivo tissue cultures that are derived from embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells or tissue-resident progenitor cells, and represent a near-physiological model for studying cancer. Organoids develop by self-organisation, and can accurately represent the diverse genetic, cellular and pathophysiological hallmarks of cancer. In addition, co-culture methods and the ability to genetically manipulate these organoids have widened their utility in cancer research. Organoids thus offer a new and exciting platform for studying cancer and directing personalised therapies. This review aims to highlight how organoids are shaping the future of cancer research.	
29963730        	Establishment and characterization of a canine keratinocyte organoid culture system.            	Perturbations of epidermal and follicular homeostasis have been attributed to a variety of skin diseases affecting dogs. The availability of an in vitro system to investigate these diseases is important to understand underlying pathomechanisms.                To establish an accurate and reliable in vitro 3D system of canine keratinocyte organoids to lay the basis for studying functional defects in interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis, reconstitution and differentiation that lead to alopecic and epidermal diseases.                Skin biopsies were obtained from freshly euthanized dogs of different breeds with no skin abnormalities.                Cells derived from microdissected IFE and HFs were seeded in Matrigel and keratinocyte organoids were grown and characterized using immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR and RNA sequencing.                Both organoid lines develop into a basal IFE-like cell type. Gene and protein expression analysis revealed high mRNA and protein levels of keratins 5 and 14, IFE differentiation markers and intercellular molecules. Key markers of HF stem cells were lacking. Withdrawal of growth factors resulted in upregulation of markers such as KRT16, Involucrin, KRT17 and SOX9, showing the potential of the organoids to develop towards more differentiated tissue.                Our 3D in vitro culture system provides the basis to explore epidermal function, to investigate the culture conditions necessary for the development of organoids with a HF signature and to address cutaneous disorders in dogs. However, for induction of HF signatures or hair growth, addition of different growth factors or co-culture with dermal papilla will be required.                © 2018 ESVD and ACVD.

33409849        	A Millifluidic Perfusion Cassette for Studying the Pathogenesis of Enteric Infections Using Ex-Vivo Organoids.            	To generate physiologically-relevant experimental models, the study of enteric diarrheal diseases is turning increasingly to advanced in vitro models that combine ex vivo, stem cell-derived "organoid" cell lines with bioengineered culture environments that expose them to mechanical stimuli, such as fluid flow. However, such approaches require considerable technical expertise with both microfabrication and organoid culture, and are, therefore, inaccessible to many researchers. For this reason, we have developed a perfusion system that is simple to fabricate, operate, and maintain. Its dimensions approximate the volume and cell culture area of traditional 96-well plates and allow the incorporation of fastidious primary, stem cell-derived cell lines with only minimal adaptation of their established culture techniques. We show that infections with enteroaggregative E. coli and norovirus, common causes of infectious diarrhea, in the system display important differences from static models, and in some ways better recreate the pathophysiology of in vivo infections. Furthermore, commensal strains of bacteria can be added alongside the pathogens to simulate the effects of a host microbiome on the infectious process. For these reasons, we believe that this perfusion system is a powerful, yet easily accessible tool for studying host-pathogen interactions in the human intestine.

23623789        	Intestinal organoids as tissue surrogates for toxicological and pharmacological studies.            	Recently developed cell culture protocols have allowed for the derivation of multi-cellular structures dubbed intestinal "organoids" from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs), and adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs). These structures resemble in vivo intestinal crypts, both in structure and developmental processes, and can be grown quickly and in relatively large quantities. Although much research has focused on developing intestinal organoids for tissue repair, more immediate applications include high-throughput screening for agents that target intestinal epithelium. Here we describe current methods for deriving mouse and human intestinal organoids and discuss some applications aimed at developing novel therapies or preventive agents for diseases of the lower GI tract such as inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.

31265831        	DC-SCRIPT deficiency delays mouse mammary gland development and branching morphogenesis.            	Mammary glands are unique organs in which major adaptive changes occur in morphogenesis and development after birth. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and a major cause of mortality in females worldwide. We have previously identified the loss of expression of the transcription regulator DC-SCRIPT (Zfp366) as a prominent prognostic event in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients. DC-SCRIPT affects multiple transcriptional events in breast cancer cells, including estrogen and progesterone receptor-mediated transcription, and promotes CDKN2B-related cell cycle arrest. As loss of DC-SCRIPT expression appears an early event in breast cancer development, we here investigated the role of DC-SCRIPT in mammary gland development using wild-type and DC-SCRIPT knockout mice. Mice lacking DC-SCRIPT exhibited severe breeding problems and showed significant growth delay relative to littermate wild-type mice. Subsequent analysis revealed that DC-SCRIPT was expressed in mouse mammary epithelium and that DC-SCRIPT deficiency delayed mammary gland morphogenesis in vivo. Finally, analysis of 3D mammary gland organoid cultures confirmed that loss of DC-SCRIPT dramatically delayed mammary organoid branching in vitro. The study shows for the first time that DC-SCRIPT deficiency delays mammary gland morphogenesis in vivo and in vitro. These data define DC-SCRIPT as a novel modulator of mammary gland development.                Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
32131500        	Development and Radiation Response Assessment in A Novel Syngeneic Mouse Model of Tongue Cancer: 2D Culture, 3D Organoids and Orthotopic Allografts.            	Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are aggressive cancers that contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Although numerous human xenograft models of OSCC have been developed, only a few syngeneic models of OSCC exist. Here, we report on a novel murine model of OSCC, RP-MOC1, derived from a tongue tumor in a C57Bl/6 mouse exposed to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. Phenotypic characterization and credentialing (STR profiling, exome sequencing) of RP-MOC1 cells was performed in vitro. Radiosensitivity was evaluated in 2D culture, 3D organoids, and in vivo using orthotopic allografts. RP-MOC1 cells exhibited a stable epithelial phenotype with proliferative, migratory and invasive properties. Exome sequencing identified several mutations commonly found in OSCC patients. The LD50 for RP-MOC1 cells in 2D culture and 3D organoids was found to be 2.4 Gy and 12.6 Gy, respectively. Orthotopic RP-MOC1 tumors were pan-cytokeratin+ and Ki-67+. Magnetic resonance imaging of orthotopic RP-MOC1 tumors established in immunocompetent mice revealed marked growth inhibition following 10 Gy and 15 Gy fractionated radiation regimens. This radiation response was completely abolished in tumors established in immunodeficient mice. This novel syngeneic model of OSCC can serve as a valuable platform for the evaluation of combination strategies to enhance radiation response against this deadly disease.	
31805828        	Organoids: Past Learning and Future Directions.            	Preclinical medical research has historically depended on either traditional two-dimensional in vitro cell culture or animal models for the purposes of disease modeling, including cancer pathophysiology, immunology studies, drug testing, and toxicity assays. However, both of these models have intrinsic flaws. Two-dimensional cell culture systems do not capture the heterogeneity of in vivo disease, being originally derived from a limited set of cell lines. They also differ from the physiology encountered in vivo, with the majority of pharmaceutical agents, including oncology drugs which are effective in vitro failing at clinical trials. Animal models have issues of cost, associated ethical concerns, and xenogeneity comparative to human systems. Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models derived from human tissue, which have the potential to overcome the issues with the traditional models discussed above. They self-organize into 3D structures resembling their tissue of origin and recapitulate some of its functions. They have been shown to be excellent models for the purposes of disease modeling and high-throughput drug screening, among others. Despite these benefits, some challenges yet remain in organoid research. It is hoped that the combination of organoid culture with bioengineering approaches may successfully overcome these.	
31866766        	Circulating tumor cells in precision oncology: clinical applications in liquid biopsy and 3D organoid model.            	Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a rare subset of cells found in the blood of patients with solid tumors, which function as a seed for metastases. Cancer cells metastasize through the bloodstream either as single migratory CTCs or as multicellular groupings-CTC clusters. The CTCs preserve primary tumor heterogeneity and mimic tumor properties, and may be considered as clinical biomarker, preclinical model, and therapeutic target. The potential clinical application of CTCs is being a component of liquid biopsy. CTCs are also good candidates for generating preclinical models, especially 3D organoid cultures, which could be applied in drug screening, disease modeling, genome editing, tumor immunity, and organoid biobanks. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the value and promise of evolving CTC technologies and highlight cutting-edge research on CTCs in liquid biopsy, tumor metastasis, and organoid preclinical models. The study of CTCs offers broad pathways to develop new biomarkers for tumor patient diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy, as well as translational models accelerating oncologic drug development.                © The Author(s) 2019.	
32586445        	Generation and use of gastric organoids for the study of Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis.            	While the incidence of gastric cancer in the United States is relatively low due to the diagnosis and treatment of the major risk factor Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), 5-year patient survival is only approximately 29%. Even after H. pylori infection has been eradicated there is still a risk of developing gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is the final clinical outcome that is often initiated by a sustained inflammatory response and altered epithelial cell differentiation and metaplasia in response to H. pylori infection. Identifying the early epithelial responses to H. pylori infection is important in advancing our understanding of the events that shape a conducive environment for the progression of gastric cancer. Thus, we developed a human gastric tissue-derived organoid-based approach to identify the initiating molecular events that trigger gastric cancer development in response to bacterial infection.                © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Although important advances have been made in the last decade, the mortality rate of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has not changed appreciably.

29643510        	Intra-tumour diversification in colorectal cancer at the single-cell level.            	Every cancer originates from a single cell. During expansion of the neoplastic cell population, individual cells acquire genetic and phenotypic differences from each other. Here, to investigate the nature and extent of intra-tumour diversification, we characterized organoids derived from multiple single cells from three colorectal cancers as well as from adjacent normal intestinal crypts. Colorectal cancer cells showed extensive mutational diversification and carried several times more somatic mutations than normal colorectal cells. Most mutations were acquired during the final dominant clonal expansion of the cancer and resulted from mutational processes that are absent from normal colorectal cells. Intra-tumour diversification of DNA methylation and transcriptome states also occurred; these alterations were cell-autonomous, stable, and followed the phylogenetic tree of each cancer. There were marked differences in responses to anticancer drugs between even closely related cells of the same tumour. The results indicate that colorectal cancer cells experience substantial increases in somatic mutation rate compared to normal colorectal cells, and that genetic diversification of each cancer is accompanied by pervasive, stable and inherited differences in the biological states of individual cancer cells.

32266252        	Primary Mammary Organoid Model of Lactation and Involution.            	Mammary gland development occurs mainly after birth and is composed of three successive stages: puberty, pregnancy and lactation, and involution. These developmental stages are associated with major tissue remodeling, including extensive changes in mammary epithelium, as well as surrounding stroma. Three-dimensional (3D) mammary organoid culture has become an important tool in mammary gland biology and enabled invaluable discoveries on pubertal mammary branching morphogenesis and breast cancer. However, a suitable 3D organoid model recapitulating key aspects of lactation and involution has been missing. Here, we describe a robust and straightforward mouse mammary organoid system modeling lactation and involution-like process, which can be applied to study mechanisms of physiological mammary gland lactation and involution as well as pregnancy-associated breast cancer.

30605261        	Organ-on-a-Chip for Cancer and Immune Organs Modeling.            	Bridging the gap between findings in preclinical 2D cell culture models and in vivo tissue cultures has been challenging; the simple microenvironment of 2D monolayer culture systems may not capture the cellular response to drugs accurately. Three-dimensional organotypic models have gained increasing interest due to their ability to recreate precise cellular organizations. These models facilitate investigation of the interactions between different sub-tissue level components through providing physiologically relevant microenvironments for cells in vitro. The incorporation of human-sourced tissues into these models further enables personalized prediction of drug responses. Integration of microfluidic units into the 3D models can be used to control their local environment, dynamic simulation of cell behaviors, and real-time readout of drug testing data. Cancer and immune system related diseases are severe burdens to our health care system and have created an urgent need for high-throughput, and effective drug development plans. This review focuses on recent progress in the development of "cancer-on-a-chip" and "immune organs-on-a-chip" systems designed to study disease progression and predict drug-induced responses. Future challenges and opportunities are also discussed.                © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.	
33111070        	Establishment and Long-Term Culture of Organoids Derived from Human Biliary Tract Carcinoma.            	This protocol is a procedure for establishment and culture of cancer and non-cancer organoids using tissues from biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) patients. These BTC organoids can be used for various biological analyses and drug screening. One challenge in establishing and culturing BTC organoids is non-cancer cells contaminating surgically resected tumor tissues form organoids concurrently with cancer organoids. Careful validation that the established organoids are cancer-derived is important. For complete details on the use and generation of this protocol, please refer to Saito et al.

26641771        	An emerging role for cytopathology in precision oncology.            	Precision medicine is an emerging field in medicine for disease prevention and treatment that takes into account the individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each individual patient. The authors have developed a special program as part of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine to grow patient-derived, 3-dimensional tumor organoids for tumor-specific drug testing, tailoring treatment strategies, and as models for studying drug resistance. Routine cytology preparations represent a cost-effective and powerful tool to aid in performing molecular testing in the age of personalized medicine. In this commentary, the platforms used for the characterization and validation of patient-derived, 3-dimensional tumor organoids are outlined and discussed, and the role of cytology as a cost-effective and powerful quality-control measure is illustrated.                © 2015 American Cancer Society.	
30100188        	Generation of Tumor-Reactive T Cells by Co-culture of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes and Tumor Organoids.            	Cancer immunotherapies have shown substantial clinical activity for a subset of patients with epithelial cancers. Still, technological platforms to study cancer T-cell interactions for individual patients and understand determinants of responsiveness are presently lacking. Here, we establish and validate a platform to induce and analyze tumor-specific T cell responses to epithelial cancers in a personalized manner. We demonstrate that co-cultures of autologous tumor organoids and peripheral blood lymphocytes can be used to enrich tumor-reactive T cells from peripheral blood of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these T cells can be used to assess the efficiency of killing of matched tumor organoids. This platform provides an unbiased strategy for the isolation of tumor-reactive T cells and provides a means by which to assess the sensitivity of tumor cells to T cell-mediated attack at the level of the individual patient.

32492856        	Metabolic Profiling of Early and Late Recurrent Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Using Patient-Derived Organoid Cultures.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with high mortality and will become the second most common cause of cancer-associated mortality by 2030. The poor prognosis arises from a lack of sensitive biomarkers, limited therapeutic options, and the astonishingly high recurrence rate after surgery of 60-80%. The factors driving this recurrence, however, remain enigmatic. Therefore, we generated patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from early- and late-recurrent PDAC patients. Cellular identity of PDOs was confirmed by qPCR, ddPCR, and IHC analyses. This is the first study investigating the metabolism in PDOs of different, clinically significant PDAC entities by untargeted GC/MS profiling. Partial least square discriminant analysis unveiled global alterations between the two sample groups. We identified nine metabolites to be increased in early recurrent PDOs in comparison to late recurrent PDOs. More than four-times increased were fumarate, malate, glutamate, aspartate, and glutamine. Hence, α-keto acids were elevated in PDO-conditioned medium derived from early recurrent patients. We therefore speculate that an increased anaplerotic metabolism fuels the Krebs-cycle and a corresponding higher accessibility to energy fastens the recurrence in PDAC patients. Therein, a therapeutic intervention could delay PDAC recurrence and prolong survival of affected patients or could serve as biomarker to predict recurrence in the future.	
25363776        	Modelling human development and disease in pluripotent stem-cell-derived gastric organoids.            	Gastric diseases, including peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, affect 10% of the world's population and are largely due to chronic Helicobacter pylori infection. Species differences in embryonic development and architecture of the adult stomach make animal models suboptimal for studying human stomach organogenesis and pathogenesis, and there is no experimental model of normal human gastric mucosa. Here we report the de novo generation of three-dimensional human gastric tissue in vitro through the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. We show that temporal manipulation of the FGF, WNT, BMP, retinoic acid and EGF signalling pathways and three-dimensional growth are sufficient to generate human gastric organoids (hGOs). Developing hGOs progressed through molecular and morphogenetic stages that were nearly identical to the developing antrum of the mouse stomach. Organoids formed primitive gastric gland- and pit-like domains, proliferative zones containing LGR5-expressing cells, surface and antral mucous cells, and a diversity of gastric endocrine cells. We used hGO cultures to identify novel signalling mechanisms that regulate early endoderm patterning and gastric endocrine cell differentiation upstream of the transcription factor NEUROG3. Using hGOs to model pathogenesis of human disease, we found that H. pylori infection resulted in rapid association of the virulence factor CagA with the c-Met receptor, activation of signalling and induction of epithelial proliferation. Together, these studies describe a new and robust in vitro system for elucidating the mechanisms underlying human stomach development and disease.	
33314005        	Host metabolism dysregulation and cell tropism identification in human airway and alveolar organoids upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.            	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is spread primary via respiratory droplets and infects the lungs. Currently widely used cell lines and animals are unable to accurately mimic human physiological conditions because of the abnormal status of cell lines (transformed or cancer cells) and species differences between animals and humans. Organoids are stem cell-derived self-organized three-dimensional culture in vitro and model the physiological conditions of natural organs. Here we showed that SARS-CoV-2 infected and extensively replicated in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived lung organoids, including airway and alveolar organoids which covered the complete infection and spread route for SARS-CoV-2 within lungs. The infected cells were ciliated, club, and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which were sequentially located from the proximal to the distal airway and terminal alveoli, respectively. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed early cell response to virus infection including an unexpected downregulation of the metabolic processes, especially lipid metabolism, in addition to the well-known upregulation of immune response. Further, Remdesivir and a human neutralizing antibody potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung organoids. Therefore, human lung organoids can serve as a pathophysiological model to investigate the underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to discover and test therapeutic drugs for COVID-19.	
29354056        	Rimonabant Kills Colon Cancer Stem Cells without Inducing Toxicity in Normal Colon Organoids.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC), like other tumor types, is a highly heterogeneous disease. Within the tumor bulk, intra-tumoral heterogeneity is also ascribable to Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) subpopulation, characterized by high chemoresistance and the unique ability to retain tumorigenic potential, thus associated to tumor recurrence. High dynamic plasticity of CSCs, makes the development of winning therapeutic strategies even more complex to completely eradicate tumor fuel. Rimonabant, originally synthesized as antagonist/inverse agonist of Cannabinoid Receptor 1, is able to inactivate Wnt signaling, both in vitro and in vivo, in CRC models, through inhibition of p300-histone acetyltransferase activity. Since Wnt/β-Catenin pathway is the main player underlying CSCs dynamic, this finding candidates Rimonabant as potential modulator of cancer stemness, in CRC. In this work, using established 3D cultures of primary colon CSCs, taking into account the tumor heterogeneity through monitoring of Wnt activity, we demonstrated that Rimonabant was able to reduces both tumor differentiated cells and colon CSCs proliferation and to control their survival in long term cultures. Interestingly, in ex vivo model of wild type human organoids, retaining both architecture and heterogeneity of original tissue, Rimonabant showed no toxicity against cells from healthy colon epithelium, suggesting its potential selectivity toward cancer cells. Overall, results from this work provided new insights on anti-tumor efficacy of Rimonabant, strongly suggesting that it could be a novel lead compound for CRC treatment.	
33215543        	Intestinal organoids: a model to study the role of microbiota in the colonic tumor microenvironment.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer worldwide. Recent studies have suggested that a dysbiotic shift in the intestinal microbial composition of CRC patients influences tumorigenesis. Gut microbes are known to be integral for intestinal homeostasis; however, the mechanisms by which they impact CRC are unclear. Further knowledge about these complex interactions may guide future CRC management. Thus, it is crucial to establish high-quality experimental models to understand the relationship between host, tumor, microbiota and their metabolic interactions. In this review, we highlight the significance of intestinal microbiota and their metabolites in CRC, challenges with current experimental models, advantages and limitations of organoid culture and future directions of this novel model system in CRC-associated microbiome research.

33253861        	Development of a Single-Cell Technique to Increase Yield and Use of Gastrointestinal Cancer Organoids for Personalized Medicine Application.            	Organoids are excellent 3-dimensional in vitro models of gastrointestinal cancers. However, patient-derived organoids (PDOs) remain inconsistent and unreliable for rapid actionable drug sensitivity testing due to size variation and limited material.                On day10/passage 2 after standard creation of organoids, half of PDOs were dissociated into single-cells with TrypLE Express Enzyme/DNase I and mechanical dissociation; and half of PDOs were expanded by the standard technique. Hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry with CK7 and CK20 were performed for characterization. Drug sensitivity testing was completed for single-cells and paired standard PDOs to assess reproducibility.                After 2 to 3 days, >50% of single-cells reformed uniform miniature PDOs (∼50 μm). We developed 10 PDO single-cell lines (n = 4, gastric cancer, [GC]; and n = 6, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, [PDAC]), which formed epithelialized cystic structures and by IHC, exhibited CK7(high)/CK20(low) expression patterns mirroring parent tissues. Compared with paired standard PDOs, single-cells (n = 2, PDAC; = 2, GC) showed similar architecture, albeit smaller and more uniform. Importantly, single cells demonstrated similar sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs to matched PDOs.                PDO single-cells are accurate for rapid clinical drug testing in gastrointestinal cancers. Using early passage PDO single-cells facilitates high-volume drug testing, decreasing time from tumor sampling to actionable clinical decisions, and provides a personalized medicine platform to optimally select drugs for gastrointestinal cancer patients.

32302515        	Cryopreservation of Viable Human Tissues: Renewable Resource for Viable Tissue, Cell Lines, and Organoid Development.            	The availability of viable human tissues is critical to support translational research focused on personalized care. Most studies have relied on fresh frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues for histopathology, genomics, and proteomics. Yet, basic, translational, and clinical research downstream assays such as tumor progression/invasion, patient-derived xenograft, organoids, immunoprofiling, and vaccine development still require viable tissue, which are time-sensitive and rare commodities. We describe the generation of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cultures to validate a viable freeze cryopreservation technique as a standard method of highest quality specimen preservation. After surgical resection, specimens were minced, placed in CryoStor™ media, and frozen using a slow freezing method (-1°C/min in -80°C) for 24 hours and then stored in liquid nitrogen. After 15-18 months, the tissues were thawed, dissociated into single-cell suspensions, and evaluated for cell viability. To generate primary 2D cultures, cells were plated onto Collagen-/Matrigel-coated plates. To develop 3D cultures (organoids), the cells were plated in reduced serum RPMI media on nonadherent plates or in Matrigel matrix. The epithelial nature of the cells was confirmed by using immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins. DNA and RNA isolation was performed using QIAGEN AllPrep kits. We developed primary lines (2D and 3D) of colon, thyroid, lung, renal, and liver cancers that were positive for cytokeratin staining. 3D lines were developed from the same cohort of tumor types in both suspended media and Matrigel matrix. Multiple freeze-thaw cycles did not significantly alter the viability and growth of 2D and 3D lines. DNA/RNA recovery was similar to its fresh frozen cohort. In this study, we validated 2D and 3D tissue cultures as methods to corroborate the feasibility of viable cryopreservation of tumor tissue. This proof-of-principle study, if more widely implemented, should improve accessibility of human viable tumor tissue/cells in a time-independent manner for many basic, preclinical, and translational assays.

33072556        	Cultivation of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Patient-Derived Organoids in an Air-Liquid Interface System as a Tool for Studying Individualized Therapy.            	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common renal cancer accounting for 80% of all renal cancers as well as the majority of renal cancer-associated deaths. During the last decade, the treatment paradigm for ccRCC has radically changed. In particular, the recent development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has led to an increased overall survival in the metastatic setting. Moreover, novel immune therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment have been developed. In this rapidly evolving treatment landscape, precise tools for personalized cancer therapy are needed. Here, we collected fresh tissue from 42 patients who underwent surgical resection for renal cell carcinoma. Part of the tissue was used to obtain formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples or RNA. The remaining tissue was minced and cultured in a collagen-based three-dimensional, air-liquid interface (ALI) culture system. The generated patient-derived tumor organoids (ALI PDOs) were characterized by immunohistochemistry staining and RNA sequencing to validate their close similarity to the matched tumor. Immune cells and stromal cells within the microenvironment could be identified. Finally, we treated 10 ALI PDOs with the commonly used targeted cancer drug cabozantinib or the ICI nivolumab. Interestingly, we observed varying responses of ALI PDOs to these treatments and future studies are needed to investigate whether the ALI PDO approach could inform about treatment responses in patients. In conclusion, this three-dimensional ccRCC culture model represents a promising, facile tool for monitoring tumor responses to different types of therapies in a controlled manner, yet, still preserves the key features of the tumor of origin.

30377341        	Direct therapeutic targeting of immune checkpoint PD-1 in pancreatic cancer.            	Pancreatic cancer (PC) hijacks innate cellular processes to promote cancer growth. We hypothesized that PC exploits PD-1/PD-L1 not only to avoid immune responses, but to directly enhance growth. We also hypothesized that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have direct cytotoxicity in PC. We sought to elucidate therapeutic targeting of PD-1/PD-L1.                PD-1 was assessed in PC cells, patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and clinical tissues. Then, PC cells were exposed to PD-L1 to evaluate proliferation. To test PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, cells were exposed to PD-L1 and MAPK was examined. Radio-immunoconjugates with anti-PD-1 drugs were developed to test uptake in patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs). Next, PD-1 function was assessed by xenografting PD-1-knockdown cells. Finally, PC models were exposed to ICIs.                PD-1 expression was demonstrated in PCs. PD-L1 exposure increased proliferation and activated MAPK. Imaging PDTXs revealed uptake of radio-immunoconjugates. PD-1 knockdown in vivo revealed 67% smaller volumes than controls. Finally, ICI treatment of both PDOs/PDTXs demonstrated cytotoxicity and anti-MEK1/2 combined with anti-PD-1 drugs produced highest cytotoxicity in PDOs/PDTXs.                Our data reveal PCs innately express PD-1 and activate druggable oncogenic pathways supporting PDAC growth. Strategies directly targeting PC with novel ICI regimens may work with adaptive immune responses for optimal cytotoxicity.	
23230278        	Two distinct populations of exosomes are released from LIM1863 colon carcinoma cell-derived organoids.            	Exosomes are naturally occurring biological nanomembranous vesicles (∼40 to 100 nm) of endocytic origin that are released from diverse cell types into the extracellular space. They have pleiotropic functions such as antigen presentation and intercellular transfer of protein cargo, mRNA, microRNA, lipids, and oncogenic potential. Here we describe the isolation, via sequential immunocapture using anti-A33- and anti-EpCAM-coupled magnetic beads, of two distinct populations of exosomes released from organoids derived from human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1863. The exosome populations (A33-Exos and EpCAM-Exos) could not be distinguished via electron microscopy and contained stereotypical exosome markers such as TSG101, Alix, and HSP70. The salient finding of this study, revealed via gel-based LC-MS/MS, was the exclusive identification in EpCAM-Exos of the classical apical trafficking molecules CD63 (LAMP3), mucin 13 and the apical intestinal enzyme sucrase isomaltase and increased expression of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and the apically restricted pentaspan membrane glycoprotein prominin 1. In contrast, the A33-Exos preparation was enriched with basolateral trafficking molecules such as early endosome antigen 1, the Golgi membrane protein ADP-ribosylation factor, and clathrin. Our observations are consistent with EpCAM- and A33-Exos being released from the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively, and the EpCAM-Exos proteome profile with widely published stereotypical exosomes. A proteome analysis of LIM1863-derived shed microvesicles (sMVs) was also performed in order to clearly distinguish A33- and EpCAM-Exos from sMVs. Intriguingly, several members of the MHC class I family of antigen presentation molecules were exclusively observed in A33-Exos, whereas neither MHC class I nor MHC class II molecules were observed via MS in EpCAM-Exos. Additionally, we report for the first time in any extracellular vesicle study the colocalization of EpCAM, claudin-7, and CD44 in EpCAM-Exos. Given that these molecules are known to complex together to promote tumor progression, further characterization of exosome subpopulations will enable a deeper understanding of their possible role in regulation of the tumor microenvironment.	
29552623        	Translating Developmental Principles to Generate Human Gastric Organoids.            	Gastric diseases, including peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, are highly prevalent in human beings. Despite this, the cellular biology of the stomach remains poorly understood relative to other gastrointestinal organs such as the liver, intestine, and colon. In particular, little is known about the molecular basis of stomach development and the differentiation of gastric lineages. Although animal models are useful for studying gastric development, function, and disease, there are major structural and physiological differences in human stomachs that render these models insufficient. To look at gastric development, function, and disease in a human context, a model system of the human stomach is imperative. This review details how this was achieved through the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells in a 3-dimensional environment into human gastric organoids (HGOs). Similar to previous work that has generated human intestine, colon, and lung tissue in vitro, HGOs were generated in vitro through a step-wise differentiation designed to mimic the temporal-spatial signaling dynamics that control stomach development in vivo. HGOs can be used for a variety of purposes, including genetic modeling, drug screening, and potentially even in future patient transplantation. Moreover, HGOs are well suited to study the development and interactions of nonepithelial cell types, such as endothelial, neuronal, and mesenchymal, which remain almost completely unstudied. This review discusses the basics of stomach morphology, function, and developmental pathways involved in generating HGOs. We also highlight important gaps in our understanding of how epithelial and mesenchymal interactions are essential for the development and overall function of the human stomach.	
32705642        	Primary Intestinal Epithelial Organoid Culture.            	The intestinal epithelium is known as one of the most regenerative tissues in our body. The lining of the intestine is composed of a single layer of epithelial cells generated by rapidly renewing stem cells residing at the crypt bottoms, resulting in a flow of cells to the villus tips. The stereotypical crypt-villus architecture makes the intestine an ideal model for stem cell research. Based on recent advances in research of stem cell niche signals in vivo, we have established an intestinal epithelial stem cell culture method. Under this culture condition, single Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) or isolated whole crypts efficiently expand into three-dimensional spherical structures recapitulating the intestinal crypt-villus organization. These organoids can be passaged weekly and maintained for years in culture. Moreover, they can be cryopreserved. As intestinal organoids recapitulate many aspects of the epithelial biology and are amenable to most, if not all, current experimental manipulations, they are widely used to study stem cell biology, cell fate determination, gene function, and disease mechanism.	
32019175        	Engineering Prostate Cancer from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells-New Opportunities to Develop Preclinical Tools in Prostate and Prostate Cancer Studies.            	One of the key issues hampering the development of effective treatments for prostate cancer is the lack of suitable, tractable, and patient-specific in vitro models that accurately recapitulate this disease. In this review, we address the challenges of using primary cultures and patient-derived xenografts to study prostate cancer. We describe emerging approaches using primary prostate epithelial cells and prostate organoids and their genetic manipulation for disease modelling. Furthermore, the use of human prostate-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is highlighted as a promising complimentary approach. Finally, we discuss the manipulation of iPSCs to generate 'avatars' for drug disease testing. Specifically, we describe how a conceptual advance through the creation of living biobanks of "genetically engineered cancers" that contain patient-specific driver mutations hold promise for personalised medicine.	
31221724        	Deficiency of nucleotide excision repair is associated with mutational signature observed in cancer.            	Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the main DNA repair pathways that protect cells against genomic damage. Disruption of this pathway can contribute to the development of cancer and accelerate aging. Mutational characteristics of NER-deficiency may reveal important diagnostic opportunities, as tumors deficient in NER are more sensitive to certain treatments. Here, we analyzed the genome-wide somatic mutational profiles of adult stem cells (ASCs) from NER-deficient Ercc1-/Δ mice. Our results indicate that NER-deficiency increases the base substitution load twofold in liver but not in small intestinal ASCs, which coincides with the tissue-specific aging pathology observed in these mice. Moreover, NER-deficient ASCs of both tissues show an increased contribution of Signature 8 mutations, which is a mutational pattern with unknown etiology that is recurrently observed in various cancer types. The scattered genomic distribution of the base substitutions indicates that deficiency of global-genome NER (GG-NER) underlies the observed mutational consequences. In line with this, we observe increased Signature 8 mutations in a GG-NER-deficient human organoid culture, in which XPC was deleted using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing. Furthermore, genomes of NER-deficient breast tumors show an increased contribution of Signature 8 mutations compared with NER-proficient tumors. Elevated levels of Signature 8 mutations could therefore contribute to a predictor of NER-deficiency based on a patient's mutational profile.                © 2019 Jager et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
33171886        	Nanotherapeutic Modulation of Human Neural Cells and Glioblastoma in Organoids and Monocultures.            	Inflammatory processes in the brain are orchestrated by microglia and astrocytes in response to activators such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, danger-associated molecular patterns and some nanostructures. Microglia are the primary immune responders in the brain and initiate responses amplified by astrocytes through intercellular signaling. Intercellular communication between neural cells can be studied in cerebral organoids, co-cultures or in vivo. We used human cerebral organoids and glioblastoma co-cultures to study glia modulation by dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS). dPGS is an extensively studied nanostructure with inherent anti-inflammatory properties. Under inflammatory conditions, lipocalin-2 levels in astrocytes are markedly increased and indirectly enhanced by soluble factors released from hyperactive microglia. dPGS is an effective anti-inflammatory modulator of these markers. Our results show that dPGS can enter neural cells in cerebral organoids and glial cells in monocultures in a time-dependent manner. dPGS markedly reduces lipocalin-2 abundance in the neural cells. Glioblastoma tumoroids of astrocytic origin respond to activated microglia with enhanced invasiveness, whereas conditioned media from dPGS-treated microglia reduce tumoroid invasiveness. Considering that many nanostructures have only been tested in cancer cells and rodent models, experiments in human 3D cerebral organoids and co-cultures are complementary in vitro models to evaluate nanotherapeutics in the pre-clinical setting. Thoroughly characterized organoids and standardized procedures for their preparation are prerequisites to gain information of translational value in nanomedicine. This study provides data for a well-characterized dendrimer (dPGS) that modulates the activation state of human microglia implicated in brain tumor invasiveness.	
32097436        	Quantification of fluorophore distribution and therapeutic response in matched in vivo and ex vivo pancreatic cancer model systems.            	Therapeutic resistance plagues cancer outcomes, challenging treatment particularly in aggressive disease. A unique method to decipher drug interactions with their targets and inform therapy is to employ fluorescence-based screening tools; however, to implement productive screening assays, adequate model systems must be developed. Patient-derived pancreatic cancer models (e.g., cell culture, patient-derived xenograft mouse models, and organoids) have been traditionally utilized to predict personalized therapeutic response. However, cost, long read out times and the inability to fully recapitulate the tumor microenvironment have rendered most models incompatible with clinical decision making for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Tumor explant cultures, where patient tissue can be kept viable for up to weeks, have garnered interest as a platform for delivering personalized therapeutic prediction on a clinically relevant timeline. To fully explore this ex vivo platform, a series of studies were completed to quantitatively compare in vivo models with tumor explants, examining gemcitabine therapeutic efficacy, small molecule uptake and drug-target engagement using a novel fluorescently-labeled gemcitabine conjugate. This initial work shows promise for patient-specific therapeutic selection, where tumor explant drug distribution and response recapitulated the in vivo behavior and could provide a valuable platform for understanding mechanisms of therapeutic response and resistance.

Tumor organoids are promising tools for cancer biology investigations and preclinical drug screenings because they are often representative of the histology and drug responses of patients. Here, we introduce a facile protocol to overcome technical limitations by generating patient-derived tumor organoids using a simplified ring-like geometry. This facilitates media exchange and drug treatment for histopathology characterization and automated high-throughput drug screenings. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Phan et al. (2019).	
32987786        	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Organoids: The Shining Light at the End of the Tunnel for Drug Response Prediction and Personalized Medicine.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents 90% of pancreatic malignancies. In contrast to many other tumor entities, the prognosis of PDAC has not significantly improved during the past thirty years. Patients are often diagnosed too late, leading to an overall five-year survival rate below 10%. More dramatically, PDAC cases are on the rise and it is expected to become the second leading cause of death by cancer in western countries by 2030. Currently, the use of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX remains the standard chemotherapy treatment but still with limited efficiency. There is an urgent need for the development of early diagnostic and therapeutic tools. To this point, in the past 5 years, organoid technology has emerged as a revolution in the field of PDAC personalized medicine. Here, we are reviewing and discussing the current technical and scientific knowledge on PDAC organoids, their future perspectives, and how they can represent a game change in the fight against PDAC by improving both diagnosis and treatment options.	
30566873        	Single-Cell Analysis Identifies LY6D as a Marker Linking Castration-Resistant Prostate Luminal Cells to Prostate Progenitors and Cancer.            	The exact identity of castrate-resistant (CR) cells and their relation to CR prostate cancer (CRPC) is unresolved. We use single-cell gene profiling to analyze the molecular heterogeneity in basal and luminal compartments. Within the luminal compartment, we identify a subset of cells intrinsically resistant to castration with a bi-lineage gene expression pattern. We discover LY6D as a marker of CR prostate progenitors with multipotent differentiation and enriched organoid-forming capacity. Lineage tracing further reveals that LY6D+ CR luminal cells can produce LY6D- luminal cells. In contrast, in luminal cells lacking PTEN, LY6D+ cells predominantly give rise to LY6D+ tumor cells, contributing to high-grade PIN lesions. Gene expression analyses in patients' biopsies indicate that LY6D expression correlates with early disease progression, including progression to CRPC. Our studies thus identify a subpopulation of luminal progenitors characterized by LY6D expression and intrinsic castration resistance. LY6D may serve as a prognostic maker for advanced prostate cancer.                Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
32105412        	Modeling Epithelial Homeostasis and Reactive Epithelial Changes in Human and Murine Three-Dimensional Esophageal Organoids.            	The homeostatic proliferation-differentiation gradient in the esophageal epithelium is perturbed under inflammatory disease conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and eosinophilic esophagitis. Herein we describe the protocols for rapid generation (<14 days) and characterization of single-cell-derived, three-dimensional (3D) esophageal organoids from human subjects and mice with normal esophageal mucosa or inflammatory disease conditions. While 3D organoids recapitulate normal epithelial renewal, proliferation, and differentiation, non-cell autonomous reactive epithelial changes under inflammatory conditions are evaluated in the absence of the inflammatory milieu. Reactive epithelial changes are reconstituted upon exposure to exogenous recombinant cytokines. These changes are modulated pharmacologically or genetically ex vivo. Molecular, structural, and functional changes are characterized by morphology, flow cytometry, biochemistry, and gene expression analyses.

32665356        	A Tissue-Engineered 3D Microvessel Model Reveals the Dynamics of Mosaic Vessel Formation in Breast Cancer.            	In solid tumors, vascular structure and function varies from the core to the periphery. This structural heterogeneity has been proposed to influence the mechanisms by which tumor cells enter the circulation. Blood vessels exhibit regional defects in endothelial coverage, which can result in cancer cells directly exposed to flow and potentially promoting intravasation. Consistent with prior reports, we observed in human breast tumors and in a mouse model of breast cancer that approximately 6% of vessels consisted of both endothelial cells and tumor cells, so-called mosaic vessels. Due, in part, to the challenges associated with observing tumor-vessel interactions deep within tumors in real-time, the mechanisms by which mosaic vessels form remain incompletely understood. We developed a tissue-engineered model containing a physiologically realistic microvessel in coculture with mammary tumor organoids. This approach allows real-time and quantitative assessment of tumor-vessel interactions under conditions that recapitulate many in vivo features. Imaging revealed that tumor organoids integrate into the endothelial cell lining, resulting in mosaic vessels with gaps in the basement membrane. While mosaic vessel formation was the most frequently observed interaction, tumor organoids also actively constricted and displaced vessels. Furthermore, intravasation of cancer cell clusters was observed following the formation of a mosaic vessel. Taken together, our data reveal that cancer cells can rapidly reshape, destroy, or integrate into existing blood vessels, thereby affecting oxygenation, perfusion, and systemic dissemination. Our novel assay also enables future studies to identify targetable mechanisms of vascular recruitment and intravasation. SIGNIFICANCE: A tissue-engineered microdevice that recapitulates the tumor-vascular microenvironment enables real-time imaging of the cellular mechanisms of mosaic vessel formation and vascular defect generation.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32432338        	Trop2 is upregulated in the transition to dysplasia in the metaplastic gastric mucosa.            	Intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma arises in a field of pre-existing metaplasia. While biomarkers of cancer and metaplasia have been identified, the definition of dysplastic transition as a critical point in the evolution of cancer has remained obscure. We have evaluated Trop2 as a putative marker of the transition from metaplasia to dysplasia in the stomach in multiple mouse models of metaplasia induction and progression. In addition, TROP2 expression was evaluated in human samples by immunostaining tissue microarrays for metaplasia, dysplasia, and gastric cancer. Dysplastic mouse organoids were evaluated in vitro following shRNA knockdown of Trop2 expression. In mouse models, no Trop2 was observed in the normal corpus and Trop2 was not induced in acute models of metaplasia induction with either L635 or DMP-777. In Mist1-Kras mice, Trop2 expression was not observed in metaplasia at 1 month after Kras induction, but was observed in dysplastic glands at 3-4 months after Kras induction. In human tissues, no Trop2 was observed in normal corpus mucosa or SPEM, but Trop2 expression was observed in incomplete intestinal metaplasia, with significantly less expression in complete intestinal metaplasia. Trop2 expression was observed in all dysplastic and 84% of gastric cancer lesions, although expression levels were variable. Dysplastic mouse organoids from Mist1-Kras mice expressed Trop2 strongly. Knockdown of Trop2 with shRNA markedly reduced organoid growth and budding behavior, and induced the upregulation of apical villin expression. We conclude that Trop2 is upregulated in the transition to dysplasia in the stomach and promotes dysplastic cell behaviors. © 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

32723016        	Trends in salivary gland tissue engineering: from stem cells to secretome and organoid bioprinting.            	Xerostomia or dry mouth are commonly diagnosed in head and neck cancer patients due to salivary gland (SG) epithelial injury after radiotherapy. Regenerative medicine has fetched the opportunity to replace or regenerate the SG epithelia and restore its secretory function. Early adult stem cell transplantation strategies in rodents have recently shown to improve clinical outcomes in radiotherapy-induced xerostomia in Phase 1/2 human trials. Mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue are the most promising, although the ones from the labial mucosa, bone marrow or dental pulp have an attractive therapeutic value after successful findings in ex vivo and in vivo mouse models of SG injury. Emerging approaches using cell-free therapy with cell "extracts", "soups" or secretome components also exhibit favorable outcomes in the same rodent models. When compared to cell-based approaches, extracellular vesicles (EV) from the secretome (i.e. exosomes) can be easily extracted, quantified and are more stable for long-term storage and use in SG tissue engineering. Additive manufacturing and three-dimensional bioprinting or bioassembly have an important role on generating spheroids or organoids for cell transplantation to ameliorate SG injury. Moreover, organoids can secrete EV, which may have a therapeutic potential worth to explore in future studies. In this review, we will describe the technological advancements and challenges of these different cell-based and cell-free strategies in SG tissue engineering and regeneration.	
30536105        	Mouse Model for Cholangiocarcinoma from Peribiliary Glands.            	A good mouse model is mandatory for elucidating carcinogenic mechanisms and identifying the cellular origin of cancer. Although the lack of an appropriate mouse model has hampered investigation of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC), we recently established a novel mouse model of biliary injury-related ECC by ductal cell-specific activation of Kras and deletion of transforming growth factor (TGF) β receptor type 2 and E-cadherin. Using this mouse model, we identified that peribiliary glands, which are considered a biliary epithelial stem cell niche, are potential cellular origins of ECC. Furthermore, we established an extrahepatic biliary organoid-derived xenograft cholangiocarcinoma (CC) model by lentiviral induction of Cre in organoids. This organoid system recreated the in vivo conditions and facilitated analysis of carcinogenesis. In this chapter, we describe the protocol used to establish our mouse model of ECC derived from peribiliary glands and our extrahepatic biliary organoid-derived xenograft model of CC.	
27135056        	Modeling pancreatic cancer with organoids.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly lethal malignancy for which new treatment and diagnostic approaches are urgently needed. In order for such breakthroughs to be discovered, researchers require systems that accurately model the development and biology of PDA. While cell lines, genetically engineered murine models, and xenografts have all led to valuable clinical insights, organotypic culture models have emerged as tractable systems to recapitulate the complex three-dimensional organization of PDA. Recently, multiple methods for modeling PDA using organoids have been reported. This review aims to summarize these organoid methods in the context of other PDA models. While each model system has unique benefits and drawbacks, ultimately, organoids hold special promise for the development of personalized medicine approaches.	
31092827        	Evaluating cell lines as models for metastatic breast cancer through integrative analysis of genomic data.            	Cell lines are widely-used models to study metastatic cancer although the extent to which they recapitulate the disease in patients remains unknown. The recent accumulation of genomic data provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the utility of them for metastatic cancer research. Here, we reveal substantial genomic differences between breast cancer cell lines and metastatic breast cancer patient samples. We also identify cell lines that more closely resemble the different subtypes of metastatic breast cancer seen in the clinic and show that surprisingly, MDA-MB-231 cells bear little genomic similarities to basal-like metastatic breast cancer patient samples. Further comparison suggests that organoids more closely resemble the transcriptome of metastatic breast cancer samples compared to cell lines. Our work provides a guide for cell line selection in the context of breast cancer metastasis and highlights the potential of organoids in these studies.	
28967890        	Long-term expansion of alveolar stem cells derived from human iPS cells in organoids.            	The stable expansion of tissue-specific stem cells in vitro has contributed to research on several organs. Alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) cells function as tissue stem cells in the lung, but robust models for studying human AT2 cells are lacking. Here we report a method for the efficient generation and long-term expansion of alveolar organoids (AOs) harboring SFTPC+ alveolar stem cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). hiPSC-derived SFTPC+ cells self-renewed, with transcriptomes and morphology consistent with those of AT2 cells, and were able to differentiate into alveolar epithelial type I (AT1)-like cells. Single-cell RNA-seq of SFTPC+ cells and their progenitors demonstrated that their differentiation process and cellular heterogeneity resembled those of developing AT2 cells in vivo. AOs were applicable to drug toxicology studies recapitulating AT2-cell-specific phenotypes. Our methods can help scientists overcome the limitations of current approaches to the modeling of human alveoli and should be useful for disease modeling and regenerative medicine.

29467240        	Identification, isolation and characterization of human LGR5-positive colon adenoma cells.            	The intestine is maintained by stem cells located at the base of crypts and distinguished by the expression of LGR5. Genetically engineered mouse models have provided a wealth of information about intestinal stem cells, whereas less is known about human intestinal stem cells owing to difficulty detecting and isolating these cells. We established an organoid repository from patient-derived adenomas, adenocarcinomas and normal colon, which we analyzed for variants in 71 colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated genes. Normal and neoplastic colon tissue organoids were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent-activated cell sorting for LGR5. LGR5-positive cells were isolated from four adenoma organoid lines and were subjected to RNA sequencing. We found that LGR5 expression in the epithelium and stroma was associated with tumor stage, and by integrating functional experiments with LGR5-sorted cell RNA sequencing data from adenoma and normal organoids, we found correlations between LGR5 and CRC-specific genes, including dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 4 (DKK4) and SPARC-related modular calcium binding 2 (SMOC2). Collectively, this work provides resources, methods and new markers to isolate and study stem cells in human tissue homeostasis and carcinogenesis.                © 2018.

32705646        	Single-Molecule RNA FISH in Whole-Mount Organoids.            	Single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) enables the detection and quantification of single RNA molecules. Three-dimensional organoid cultures have emerged as versatile in vitro primary culture models that recapitulate many physiological features of their tissue of origin. Here we describe a protocol to visualize single RNA molecules in organoid cultures. Our method accommodates both a whole-mount staining workflow which requires spinning disk confocal microscopy, and a cryosectioning workflow which is compatible with widefield microscopy. Organoid smFISH enables to address various biological problems that range from the identification of cell types (e.g., via the intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5) to the quantification of RNA localization in an epithelium.	
33000005        	Protocol for Efficient Protein Synthesis Detection by Click Chemistry in Colorectal Cancer Patient-Derived Organoids Grown In Vitro.            	Here, we describe a protocol to detect and visualize protein synthesis by click-chemistry-based immunofluorescence in patient-derived organoids (PDOs) in vitro. The protocol uses O-propargyl puromycin (OPP), an analog of puromycin that enters the acceptor site of ribosomes and is incorporated into nascent polypeptides. OPP can be detected by a click chemistry reaction and can be combined with conventional antibody staining. We describe procedures for imaging intact organoids in 3D format or imaging sections of organoids from paraffin blocks.

30596880        	HER2 exon 20 insertions in non-small-cell lung cancer are sensitive to the irreversible pan-HER receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor pyrotinib.            	Effective targeted therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations remains an unmet need. This study investigated the antitumor effect of an irreversible pan-HER receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, pyrotinib.                Using patient-derived organoids and xenografts established from an HER2-A775_G776YVMA-inserted advanced lung adenocarcinoma patient sample, we investigated the antitumor activity of pyrotinib. Preliminary safety and efficacy of pyrotinib in 15 HER2-mutant NSCLC patients in a phase II clinical trial are also presented.                Pyrotinib showed significant growth inhibition of organoids relative to afatinib in vitro (P = 0.0038). In the PDX model, pyrotinib showed a superior antitumor effect than afatinib (P = 0.0471) and T-DM1 (P = 0.0138). Mice treated with pyrotinib displayed significant tumor burden reduction (mean tumor volume, -52.2%). In contrast, afatinib (25.4%) and T-DM1 (10.9%) showed no obvious reduction. Moreover, pyrotinib showed a robust ability to inhibit pHER2, pERK and pAkt. In the phase II cohort of 15 patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC, pyrotinib 400 mg resulted in a objective response rate of 53.3% and a median progression-free survival of 6.4 months.                Pyrotinib showed activity against NSCLC with HER2 exon 20 mutations in both patient-derived organoids and a PDX model. In the clinical trial, pyrotinib showed promising efficacy.

33319176        	Manipulating the Tumor Microenvironment in Tumor Organoids Induces Phenotypic Changes and Chemoresistance.            	Tumors comprised a tightly surrounded tumor microenvironment, made up of non-cellular extracellular matrix (ECM) and stromal cells. Although treatment response is often attributed to tumor heterogeneity, progression and malignancy are profoundly influenced by tumor cell interactions with the surrounding ECM. Here, we used a tumor organoid model, consisting of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) embedded in collagen type 1 (Col1) and colorectal cancer cell (HCT-116) spheroids, to determine the relationship between the ECM architecture, cancer cell malignancy, and chemoresistance. Exogenous transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) used to activate the HSCs increased the remodeling and bundling of Col1 in the ECM around the cancer spheroid. A dense ECM architecture inhibited tumor cell growth, reversed their mesenchymal phenotype, preserved stem cell population, and reduced chemotherapy response. Overall, our results demonstrate that controlled biofabrication and manipulation of the ECM in tumor organoids results enables studying tumor cell-ECM interactions and better understand tumor cell response to chemotherapies.                © 2020 The Author(s).	
28951614        	Interleukin-6 blockade attenuates lung cancer tissue construction integrated by cancer stem cells.            	In the present study, we successfully generated lung cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells by introducing a small set of transcription factors into a lung cancer cell line. In addition to properties that are conventionally referred to as CSC properties, the lung induced CSCs exhibited the ability to form lung cancer-like tissues in vitro with vascular cells and mesenchymal stem cells, which showed structures and immunohistological patterns that were similar to human lung cancer tissues. We named them "lung cancer organoids". We found that interleukin-6 (IL-6), which was expressed in the lung induced CSCs, facilitates the formation of lung cancer organoids via the conversion of mesenchymal stem cells into alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-positive cells. Interestingly, the combination of anti-IL-6 antibody and cisplatin could destroy the lung cancer organoids, while cisplatin alone could not. Furthermore, IL-6 mRNA-positive cancer cells were found in clinical lung cancer samples. These results suggest that IL-6 could be a novel therapeutic target in lung cancer.	
33395688        	S100P Expression via DNA Hypomethylation Promotes Cell Growth in the Sessile Serrated Adenoma/Polyp-Cancer Sequence.            	Sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps) are a putative precursor lesion of colon cancer. Although the relevance of DNA hypermethylation in the SSA/P-cancer sequence is well documented, the role of DNA hypomethylation is unknown. We investigated the biological relevance of DNA hypomethylation in the SSA/P-cancer sequence by using 3-dimensional organoids of SSA/P.                We first analyzed hypomethylated genes using datasets from our previous DNA methylation array analysis on 7 SSA/P and 2 cancer in SSA/P specimens. Expression levels of hypomethylated genes in SSA/P specimens were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We established 3-dimensional SSA/P organoids and performed knockdown experiments using a lentiviral shRNA vector. DNA hypomethylation at CpG sites of the gene was quantitated by MassARRAY analysis.                The mean number of hypomethylated genes in SSA/P and cancer in SSA/P was 41.6 ± 27.5 and 214 ± 19.8, respectively, showing a stepwise increment in hypomethylation during the SSA/P-cancer sequence. S100P, S100α2, PKP3, and MUC2 were most commonly hypomethylated in SSA/P specimens. The mRNA and protein expression levels of S100P, S100α2, and MUC2 were significantly elevated in SSA/P compared with normal colon tissues, as revealed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Among these, mRNA and protein levels were highest for S100P. Knockdown of the S100P gene using a lentiviral shRNA vector in 3-dimensional SSA/P organoids inhibited cell growth by >50% (p < 0.01). The mean diameter of SSA/P organoids with S100P gene knockdown was significantly smaller compared with control organoids. MassARRAY analysis of DNA hypomethylation in the S100P gene revealed significant hypomethylation at specific CpG sites in intron 1, exon 1, and the 5'-flanking promoter region.                These results suggest that DNA hypomethylation, including S100P hypomethylation, is supposedly associated with the SSA/P-cancer sequence. S100P overexpression via DNA hypomethylation plays an important role in promoting cell growth in the SSA/P-cancer sequence.                © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Our group reported that three-dimensional (3D) coculture of fetal liver cells (FLCs) and adult rat biliary epithelial cells (BECs) allows reconstruction of hepatic spheroids that possess bile ductular structures. In this chapter, we describe the detailed protocol to isolate FLCs and BECs and to generate the spheroids with bile drainage system using these two types of primary cells.	
29543440        	Multiplexed Real-Time NMR GTPase Assay for Simultaneous Monitoring of Multiple Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor Activities from Human Cancer Cells and Organoids.            	Small GTPases (sGTPases) are critical switch-like regulators that mediate several important cellular functions and are often mutated in human cancers. They are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which specifically catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP. GEFs coordinate signaling networks in normal cells, and are frequently deregulated in cancers. sGTPase signaling pathways are complex and interconnected; however, most GEF assays do not reveal such complexity. In this Communication, we describe the development of a unique real-time NMR-based multiplexed GEF assay that employs distinct isotopic labeling schemes for each sGTPase protein to enable simultaneous observation of six proteins of interest. We monitor nucleotide exchange of KRas, Rheb, RalB, RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1 in a single system, and assayed the activities of GEFs in lysates of cultured human cells and 3D organoids derived from pancreatic cancer patients. We observed potent activation of RhoA by lysates of HEK293a cells transfected with GEF-H1, along with weak stimulation of Rac1, which we showed is indirect. Our functional analyses of pancreatic cancer-derived organoids revealed higher GEF activity for RhoA than other sGTPases, in line with RNA-seq data indicating high expression of RhoA-specific GEFs.	
32299813        	Patient-Derived Organoids from Multiple Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases Reveal Moderate Intra-patient Pharmacotranscriptomic Heterogeneity.            	Molecular tumor heterogeneity may have important implications for the efficacy of targeted therapies in metastatic cancers. Inter-metastatic heterogeneity of sensitivity to anticancer agents has not been well explored in colorectal cancer.                We established a platform for ex vivo pharmacogenomic profiling of patient-derived organoids (PDO) from resected colorectal cancer liver metastases. Drug sensitivity testing (n = 40 clinically relevant agents) and gene expression profiling were performed on 39 metastases from 22 patients.                Three drug-response clusters were identified among the colorectal cancer metastases, based primarily on sensitivities to EGFR and/or MDM2 inhibition, and corresponding with RAS mutations and TP53 activity. Potentially effective therapies, including off-label use of drugs approved for other cancer types, could be nominated for eighteen patients (82%). Antimetabolites and targeted agents lacking a decisive genomic marker had stronger differential activity than most approved chemotherapies. We found limited intra-patient drug sensitivity heterogeneity between PDOs from multiple (2-5) liver metastases from each of ten patients. This was recapitulated at the gene expression level, with a highly proportional degree of transcriptomic and pharmacological variation. One PDO with a multi-drug resistance profile, including resistance to EGFR inhibition in a RAS-mutant background, showed sensitivity to MEK plus mTOR/AKT inhibition, corresponding with low-level PTEN expression.                Intra-patient inter-metastatic pharmacological heterogeneity was not pronounced and ex vivo drug screening may identify novel treatment options for metastatic colorectal cancer. Variation in drug sensitivities was reflected at the transcriptomic level, suggesting potential to develop gene expression-based predictive signatures to guide experimental therapies.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31243370        	FOXA1 mutations alter pioneering activity, differentiation and prostate cancer phenotypes.            	Mutations in the transcription factor FOXA1 define a unique subset of prostate cancers but the functional consequences of these mutations and whether they confer gain or loss of function is unknown1-9. Here, by annotating the landscape of FOXA1 mutations from 3,086 human prostate cancers, we define two hotspots in the forkhead domain: Wing2 (around 50% of all mutations) and the highly conserved DNA-contact residue R219 (around 5% of all mutations). Wing2 mutations are detected in adenocarcinomas at all stages, whereas R219 mutations are enriched in metastatic tumours with neuroendocrine histology. Interrogation of the biological properties of wild-type FOXA1 and fourteen FOXA1 mutants reveals gain of function in mouse prostate organoid proliferation assays. Twelve of these mutants, as well as wild-type FOXA1, promoted an exaggerated pro-luminal differentiation program, whereas two different R219 mutants blocked luminal differentiation and activated a mesenchymal and neuroendocrine transcriptional program. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of wild-type FOXA1 and representative Wing2 and R219 mutants revealed marked, mutant-specific changes in open chromatin at thousands of genomic loci and exposed sites of FOXA1 binding and associated increases in gene expression. Of note, ATAC-seq peaks in cells expressing R219 mutants lacked the canonical core FOXA1-binding motifs (GTAAAC/T) but were enriched for a related, non-canonical motif (GTAAAG/A), which was preferentially activated by R219-mutant FOXA1 in reporter assays. Thus, FOXA1 mutations alter its pioneering function and perturb normal luminal epithelial differentiation programs, providing further support for the role of lineage plasticity in cancer progression.	
26418304        	Stem Cell Antigen-1 Identifies a Distinct Androgen-Independent Murine Prostatic Luminal Cell Lineage with Bipotent Potential.            	Recent lineage tracing studies support the existence of prostate luminal progenitors that possess extensive regenerative capacity, but their identity remains unknown. We show that Sca-1 (stem cell antigen-1) identifies a small population of murine prostate luminal cells that reside in the proximal prostatic ducts adjacent to the urethra. Sca-1(+) luminal cells do not express Nkx3.1. They do not carry the secretory function, although they express the androgen receptor. These cells are enriched in the prostates of castrated mice. In the in vitro prostate organoid assay, a small fraction of the Sca-1(+) luminal cells are capable of generating budding organoids that are morphologically distinct from those derived from other cell lineages. Histologically, this type of organoid is composed of multiple inner layers of luminal cells surrounded by multiple outer layers of basal cells. When passaged, these organoids retain their morphological and histological features. Finally, the Sca-1(+) luminal cells are capable of forming small prostate glands containing both basal and luminal cells in an in vivo prostate regeneration assay. Collectively, our study establishes the androgen-independent and bipotent organoid-forming Sca-1(+) luminal cells as a functionally distinct cellular entity. These cells may represent a putative luminal progenitor population and serve as a cellular origin for castration resistant prostate cancer.                © 2015 AlphaMed Press.	
29466296        	Sarcoma Spheroids and Organoids-Promising Tools in the Era of Personalized Medicine.            	Cancer treatment is rapidly evolving toward personalized medicine, which takes into account the individual molecular and genetic variability of tumors. Sophisticated new in vitro disease models, such as three-dimensional cell cultures, may provide a tool for genetic, epigenetic, biomedical, and pharmacological research, and help determine the most promising individual treatment. Sarcomas, malignant neoplasms originating from mesenchymal cells, may have a multitude of genomic aberrations that give rise to more than 70 different histopathological subtypes. Their low incidence and high level of histopathological heterogeneity have greatly limited progress in their treatment, and trials of clinical sarcoma are less frequent than trials of other carcinomas. The main advantage of 3D cultures from tumor cells or biopsy is that they provide patient-speciﬁc models of solid tumors, and they overcome some limitations of traditional 2D monolayer cultures by reflecting cell heterogeneity, native histologic architectures, and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Recent advances promise that these models can help bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical research by providing a relevant in vitro model of human cancer useful for drug testing and studying metastatic and dormancy mechanisms. However, additional improvements of 3D models are expected in the future, specifically the inclusion of tumor vasculature and the immune system, to enhance their full ability to capture the biological features of native tumors in high-throughput screening. Here, we summarize recent advances and future perspectives of spheroid and organoid in vitro models of rare sarcomas that can be used to investigate individual molecular biology and predict clinical responses. We also highlight how spheroid and organoid culture models could facilitate the personalization of sarcoma treatment, provide specific clinical scenarios, and discuss the relative strengths and limitations of these models.

Mice with disruption of the trefoil factor 1 gene (Tff1) develop gastric neoplasms. We studied these mice to identify conserved miRNA networks involved in gastric carcinogenesis.                We performed next-generation miRNA sequencing analysis of normal gastric tissues (based on histology) from patients without evidence of gastric neoplasm (n = 64) and from TFF1-knockout mice (n = 22). We validated our findings using 270 normal gastric tissues (including 61 samples from patients without evidence of neoplastic lesions) and 234 gastric tumor tissues from 3 separate cohorts of patients and from mice. We performed molecular and functional assays using cell lines (MKN28, MKN45, STKM2, and AGS cells), gastric organoids, and mice with xenograft tumors.                We identified 117 miRNAs that were significantly deregulated in mouse and human gastric tumor tissues compared with nontumor tissues. We validated changes in levels of 6 miRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of neoplastic gastric tissues from mice (n = 39) and 3 independent patient cohorts (n = 332 patients total). We found levels of MIR135B-5p, MIR196B-5p, and MIR92A-5p to be increased in tumor tissues, whereas levels of MIR143-3p, MIR204-5p, and MIR133-3p were decreased in tumor tissues. Levels of MIR143-3p were reduced not only in gastric cancer tissues but also in normal tissues adjacent to tumors in humans and low-grade dysplasia in mice. Transgenic expression of MIR143-3p in gastric cancer cell lines reduced their proliferation and restored their sensitivity to cisplatin. AGS cells with stable transgenic expression of MIR143-3p grew more slowly as xenograft tumors in mice than control AGS cells; tumor growth from AGS cells that expressed MIR143-3p, but not control cells, was sensitive to cisplatin. We identified and validated bromodomain containing 2 (BRD2) as a direct target of MIR143-3p; increased levels of BRD2 in gastric tumors was associated with shorter survival times for patients.                In an analysis of miRNA profiles of gastric tumors from mice and human patients, we identified a conserved signature associated with the early stages of gastric tumorigenesis. Strategies to restore MIR143-3p or inhibit BRD2 might be developed for treatment of gastric cancer.                Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
28757253        	Enhancer Reprogramming Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Metastasis.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most lethal human malignancies, owing in part to its propensity for metastasis. Here, we used an organoid culture system to investigate how transcription and the enhancer landscape become altered during discrete stages of disease progression in a PDA mouse model. This approach revealed that the metastatic transition is accompanied by massive and recurrent alterations in enhancer activity. We implicate the pioneer factor FOXA1 as a driver of enhancer activation in this system, a mechanism that renders PDA cells more invasive and less anchorage-dependent for growth in vitro, as well as more metastatic in vivo. In this context, FOXA1-dependent enhancer reprogramming activates a transcriptional program of embryonic foregut endoderm. Collectively, our study implicates enhancer reprogramming, FOXA1 upregulation, and a retrograde developmental transition in PDA metastasis.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

32061302        	Colorectal Cancer Modeling with Organoids: Discriminating between Oncogenic RAS and BRAF Variants.            	RAS and BRAF proteins are frequently mutated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and have been associated with therapy resistance in metastatic CRC patients. RAS isoforms are considered to act as redundant entities in physiological and pathological settings. However, there is compelling evidence that mutant variants of RAS and BRAF have different oncogenic potentials and therapeutic outcomes. In this review we describe similarities and differences between various RAS and BRAF oncogenes in CRC development, histology, and therapy resistance. In addition, we discuss the potential of patient-derived tumor organoids for personalized therapy, as well as CRC modeling using genome editing in preclinical model systems to study similarities and discrepancies between the effects of oncogenic MAPK pathway mutations on tumor growth and drug response.

33098909        	Breast cancer organoid model allowed to reveal potentially beneficial combinations of 3,3'-diindolylmethane and chemotherapy drugs.            	Epigenetic alterations represent promising therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. Recently it was revealed that small molecules have the potential to act as microRNA silencers. Capacity to bind the discrete stem-looped structure of pre-miR-21 and prevent its maturation opens opportunities to utilize such compounds for the prevention of initiation, progression, and chemoresistance of cancer. Molecular simulations performed earlier identified 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) as a potent microRNA-21 antagonist. However, data on DIM and microRNA-21 interplay is controversial, which may be caused by the limitations of the cell lines.

32705641        	Large-Scale Production of Recombinant Noggin and R-Spondin1 Proteins Required for the Maintenance of Stem Cells in Intestinal Organoid Cultures.            	The presence of the proteins mouse R-Spondin1 (mRSpo1) and mouse Noggin (mNoggin) in a 3D-organoid culture allows for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells. Here, we describe a transient gene expression method for the production of these proteins from human embryo kidney 293 (HEK293) cells cultivated in suspension using orbitally shaken bioreactors. Plasmid DNA was delivered into cells using the cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI). The 7-day production cultures were performed in the presence of valproic acid (VPA), an enhancer of recombinant gene expression. Both proteins were secreted from the transfected cells. mRSpo1 was produced as a secreted Fc fusion protein (mRSpo1-Fc) and purified by protein A-based affinity chromatography. mNoggin was produced as a secreted histidine-tagged protein (mNoggin-His) and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). This transient transfection system supports a high production efficiency.	
33097693        	Prime editing for functional repair in patient-derived disease models.            	Prime editing is a recent genome editing technology using fusion proteins of Cas9-nickase and reverse transcriptase, that holds promise to correct the vast majority of genetic defects. Here, we develop prime editing for primary adult stem cells grown in organoid culture models. First, we generate precise in-frame deletions in the gene encoding β-catenin (CTNNB1) that result in proliferation independent of Wnt-stimuli, mimicking a mechanism of the development of liver cancer. Moreover, prime editing functionally recovers disease-causing mutations in intestinal organoids from patients with DGAT1-deficiency and liver organoids from a patient with Wilson disease (ATP7B). Prime editing is as efficient in 3D grown organoids as in 2D grown cell lines and offers greater precision than Cas9-mediated homology directed repair (HDR). Base editing remains more reliable than prime editing but is restricted to a subgroup of pathogenic mutations. Whole-genome sequencing of four prime-edited clonal organoid lines reveals absence of genome-wide off-target effects underscoring therapeutic potential of this versatile and precise gene editing strategy.	
29673923        	CRISPR/Cas9 for cancer research and therapy.            	CRISPR/Cas9 has become a powerful method for making changes to the genome of many organisms. First discovered in bacteria as part of an adaptive immune system, CRISPR/Cas9 and modified versions have found a widespread use to engineer genomes and to activate or to repress the expression of genes. As such, CRISPR/Cas9 promises to accelerate cancer research by providing an efficient technology to dissect mechanisms of tumorigenesis, identify targets for drug development, and possibly arm cells for cell-based therapies. Here, we review current applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for cancer research and therapy. We describe novel Cas9 variants and how they are used in functional genomics to discover novel cancer-specific vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of CRISPR/Cas9 in generating organoid and mouse models of cancer. Finally, we provide an overview of the first clinical trials that apply CRISPR/Cas9 as a therapeutic approach against cancer.                Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

31361756        	Recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4) suppresses breast cancer cell invasion by inhibiting TGFβ-Hyaluronan-CD44 signalling pathway.            	Metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. The ability of cancer cells to become invasive and migratory contribute significantly to metastatic growth, which necessitates the identification of novel anti-migratory and anti-invasive therapeutic approaches. Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), a mucin-like glycoprotein, contributes to joint synovial homeostasis through its friction-reducing and anti-adhesive properties. Adhesion to surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) components is critical for cancer cells to invade the ECM and eventually become metastatic, raising the question whether PRG4 has an anti-invasive effect on cancer cells. Here, we report that a full-length recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4) suppresses the ability of the secreted protein transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) to induce phenotypic disruption of three-dimensional human breast cancer cell-derived organoids by reducing ligand-induced cell invasion. In mechanistic studies, we find that rhPRG4 suppresses TGFβ-induced invasiveness of cancer cells by inhibiting the downstream hyaluronan (HA)-cell surface cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) signalling axis. Furthermore, we find that rhPRG4 represses TGFβ-dependent increase in the protein abundance of CD44 and of the enzyme HAS2, which is involved in HA biosynthesis. It is widely accepted that TGFβ has both tumor suppressing and tumor promoting roles in cancer. The novel finding that rhPRG4 opposes HAS2 and CD44 induction by TGFβ has implications for downregulating the tumor promoting roles, while maintaining the tumor suppressive aspects of TGFβ actions. Finally, these findings point to rhPRG4's potential clinical utility as a therapeutic treatment for invasive and metastatic breast cancer.	
33087710        	5-FU promotes stemness of colorectal cancer via p53-mediated WNT/β-catenin pathway activation.            	5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) remains the first-line treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC). Although 5-FU initially de-bulks the tumor mass, recurrence after chemotherapy is the barrier to effective clinical outcomes for CRC patients. Here, we demonstrate that p53 promotes WNT3 transcription, leading to activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway in ApcMin/+/Lgr5EGFP mice, CRC patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) and patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs). Through this regulation, 5-FU induces activation and enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the residual tumors, contributing to recurrence after treatment. Combinatorial treatment of a WNT inhibitor and 5-FU effectively suppresses the CSCs and reduces tumor regrowth after discontinuation of treatment. These findings indicate p53 as a critical mediator of 5-FU-induced CSC activation via the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and highlight the significance of combinatorial treatment of WNT inhibitor and 5-FU as a compelling therapeutic strategy to improve the poor outcomes of current 5-FU-based therapies for CRC patients.	
33619017        	Three-dimensional model of glioblastoma by co-culturing tumor stem cells with human brain organoids.            	Emerging three-dimensional (3D) cultures of glioblastoma are becoming powerful models to study glioblastoma stem cell behavior and the impact of cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions on tumor growth and invasion. Here we describe a method for culturing human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) in 3D by co-culturing them with pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids. This requires multiple coordinated steps, including the generation of cerebral organoids, and the growth and fluorescence tagging of GSCs. We highlight how to recognize optimal organoid generation and how to efficiently mark GSCs, before describing optimized co-culture conditions. We show that GSCs can efficiently integrate into brain organoids and maintain a significant degree of cell fate heterogeneity, paving the way for the analysis of GSC fate behavior and lineage progression. These results establish the 3D culture system as a viable and versatile GBM model for investigating tumor cell biology and GSC heterogeneity.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.                © 2021.

32224870        	Dysregulated Pyrimidine Biosynthesis Contributes to 5-FU Resistance in SCLC Patient-Derived Organoids but Response to a Novel Polymeric Fluoropyrimidine, CF10.            	Chemo-immunotherapy is central to the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Despite modest progress made with the addition of immunotherapy, current cytotoxic regimens display minimal survival benefit and new treatments are needed. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well-validated anti-cancer drug target, but conventional TS inhibitors display limited clinical efficacy in refractory or recurrent SCLC. We performed RNA-Seq analysis to identify gene expression changes in SCLC biopsy samples to provide mechanistic insight into the potential utility of targeting pyrimidine biosynthesis to treat SCLC. We identified systematic dysregulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis, including elevated TYMS expression that likely contributes to the lack of efficacy for current TS inhibitors in SCLC. We also identified E2F1-3 upregulation in SCLC as a potential driver of TYMS expression that may contribute to tumor aggressiveness. To test if TS inhibition could be a viable strategy for SCLC treatment, we developed patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from human SCLC biopsy samples and used these to evaluate both conventional fluoropyrimidine drugs (e.g., 5-fluorouracil), platinum-based drugs, and CF10, a novel fluoropyrimidine polymer with enhanced TS inhibition activity. PDOs were relatively resistant to 5-FU and while moderately sensitive to the front-line agent cisplatin, were relatively more sensitive to CF10. Our studies demonstrate dysregulated pyrimidine biosynthesis contributes to drug resistance in SCLC and indicate that a novel approach to target these pathways may improve outcomes.	
33520358        	Application and research progress of organoids in cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma.            	Both cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) are belong to biliary tract carcinomas (BTCs) with a high degree of malignancy and a poor prognosis. Therefore, an in vitro model is urgently needed to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of BTCs. Tumor organoids are a novel three-dimensional (3D) culture technology that utilizes samples from removed tumors. Therefore, it can maintain the histological features, expression profiles and marker expression of the parental tissues. Recently, with the widespread use of this technique, increasing research is beginning to use organoid to study the cellular metabolism, pathogenesis, chemotherapy resistance, and new therapy methods of BTCs. In this review, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of BTC organoids compared with other cell culture techniques. In addition, the construction methods, research directions and current limitations of BTC organoids will be described.                AJCR Copyright © 2021.	
30305139        	Consistent and reproducible cultures of large-scale 3D mammary epithelial structures using an accessible bioprinting platform.            	Standard three-dimensional (3D) in vitro culture techniques, such as those used for mammary epithelial cells, rely on random distribution of cells within hydrogels. Although these systems offer advantages over traditional 2D models, limitations persist owing to the lack of control over cellular placement within the hydrogel. This results in experimental inconsistencies and random organoid morphology. Robust, high-throughput experimentation requires greater standardization of 3D epithelial culture techniques.                Here, we detail the use of a 3D bioprinting platform as an investigative tool to control the 3D formation of organoids through the "self-assembly" of human mammary epithelial cells. Experimental bioprinting procedures were optimized to enable the formation of controlled arrays of individual mammary organoids. We define the distance and cell number parameters necessary to print individual organoids that do not interact between print locations as well as those required to generate large contiguous organoids connected through multiple print locations.                We demonstrate that as few as 10 cells can be used to form 3D mammary structures in a single print and that prints up to 500 μm apart can fuse to form single large structures. Using these fusion parameters, we demonstrate that both linear and non-linear (contiguous circles) can be generated with sizes of 3 mm in length/diameter. We confirm that cells from individual prints interact to form structures with a contiguous lumen. Finally, we demonstrate that organoids can be printed into human collagen hydrogels, allowing for all-human 3D culture systems.                Our platform is adaptable to different culturing protocols and is superior to traditional random 3D culture techniques in efficiency, reproducibility, and scalability. Importantly, owing to the low-cost accessibility and computer numerical control-driven platform of our 3D bioprinter, we have the ability to disseminate our experiments with absolute precision to interested laboratories.	
33579932        	Genomic aberrations after short-term exposure to colibactin-producing E. coli transform primary colon epithelial cells.            	Genotoxic colibactin-producing pks+ Escherichia coli induce DNA double-strand breaks, mutations, and promote tumor development in mouse models of colorectal cancer (CRC). Colibactin's distinct mutational signature is reflected in human CRC, suggesting a causal link. Here, we investigate its transformation potential using organoids from primary murine colon epithelial cells. Organoids recovered from short-term infection with pks+ E. coli show characteristics of CRC cells, e.g., enhanced proliferation, Wnt-independence, and impaired differentiation. Sequence analysis of Wnt-independent organoids reveals an enhanced mutational burden, including chromosomal aberrations typical of genomic instability. Although we do not find classic Wnt-signaling mutations, we identify several mutations in genes related to p53-signaling, including miR-34a. Knockout of Trp53 or miR-34 in organoids results in Wnt-independence, corroborating a functional interplay between the p53 and Wnt pathways. We propose larger chromosomal alterations and aneuploidy as the basis of transformation in these organoids, consistent with the early appearance of chromosomal instability in CRC.	
30992322        	A Human Organotypic Microfluidic Tumor Model Permits Investigation of the Interplay between Patient-Derived Fibroblasts and Breast Cancer Cells.            	Tumor-stroma interactions significantly influence cancer cell metastasis and disease progression. These interactions are partly comprised of the cross-talk between tumor and stromal fibroblasts, but the key molecular mechanisms within the cross-talk that govern cancer invasion are still unclear. Here, we adapted our previously developed microfluidic device as a 3D in vitro organotypic model to mechanistically study tumor-stroma interactions by mimicking the spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment on a chip. We cocultured breast cancer and patient-derived fibroblast cells in 3D tumor and stroma regions, respectively, and combined functional assessments, including cancer cell migration, with transcriptome profiling to unveil the molecular influence of tumor-stroma cross-talk on invasion. This led to the observation that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) enhanced invasion in 3D by inducing expression of a novel gene of interest, glycoprotein nonmetastatic B (GPNMB), in breast cancer cells, resulting in increased migration speed. Importantly, knockdown of GPNMB blunted the influence of CAF on enhanced cancer invasion. Overall, these results demonstrate the ability of our model to recapitulate patient-specific tumor microenvironments to investigate the cellular and molecular consequences of tumor-stroma interactions. SIGNIFICANCE: An organotypic model of tumor-stroma interactions on a microfluidic chip reveals that CAFs promote invasion by enhancing expression of GPNMB in breast cancer cells.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32376656        	Medium-throughput Drug Screening of Patient-derived Organoids from Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases to Direct Personalized Therapy.            	Patients with colorectal cancer with peritoneal metastases (CRPMs) have limited treatment options and the lowest colorectal cancer survival rates. We aimed to determine whether organoid testing could help guide precision treatment for patients with CRPMs, as the clinical utility of prospective, functional drug screening including nonstandard agents is unknown.                CRPM organoids (peritonoids) isolated from patients underwent parallel next-generation sequencing and medium-throughput drug panel testing ex vivo to identify specific drug sensitivities for each patient. We measured the utility of such a service including: success of peritonoid generation, time to cultivate peritonoids, reproducibility of the medium-throughput drug testing, and documented changes to clinical therapy as a result of the testing.                Peritonoids were successfully generated and validated from 68% (19/28) of patients undergoing standard care. Genomic and drug profiling was completed within 8 weeks and a formal report ranking drug sensitivities was provided to the medical oncology team upon failure of standard care treatment. This resulted in a treatment change for two patients, one of whom had a partial response despite previously progressing on multiple rounds of standard care chemotherapy. The barrier to implementing this technology in Australia is the need for drug access and funding for off-label indications.                Our approach is feasible, reproducible, and can guide novel therapeutic choices in this poor prognosis cohort, where new treatment options are urgently needed. This platform is relevant to many solid organ malignancies.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
29853607        	Itraconazole targets cell cycle heterogeneity in colorectal cancer.            	Cellular dormancy and heterogeneity in cell cycle length provide important explanations for treatment failure after adjuvant therapy with S-phase cytotoxics in colorectal cancer (CRC), yet the molecular control of the dormant versus cycling state remains unknown. We sought to understand the molecular features of dormant CRC cells to facilitate rationale identification of compounds to target both dormant and cycling tumor cells. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that dormant CRC cells are differentiated, yet retain clonogenic capacity. Mouse organoid drug screening identifies that itraconazole generates spheroid collapse and loss of dormancy. Human CRC cell dormancy and tumor growth can also be perturbed by itraconazole, which is found to inhibit Wnt signaling through noncanonical hedgehog signaling. Preclinical validation shows itraconazole to be effective in multiple assays through Wnt inhibition, causing both cycling and dormant cells to switch to global senescence. These data provide preclinical evidence to support an early phase trial of itraconazole in CRC.                © 2018 Buczacki et al.	
32277725        	Characterization of human-induced pluripotent stem cells carrying homozygous RB1 gene deletion.            	Retinoblastoma is an infant cancer that results from loss of RB1 expression in both alleles. The RB1 gene was the first reported cancer suppressor gene; however, the mechanism by which RB1 loss causes cancer in the retina has not yet been clarified. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide an ideal tool for mechanistic research regarding retinoblastoma. However, because RB1 is a tumor suppressor, loss of both alleles of RB1 in human iPS cells may affect the phenotype of the cells. To examine this possibility, we established human iPSCs with deletions in both alleles of RB1 by CRISPR/Cas9 technique to characterize the associated phenotype. We first examined the expression of RB1 transcripts by RT-qPCR, and RB1 transcripts were expressed in immature hiPSCs and then the expression levels of RB1 transcripts consistently increased during retinal organoid differentiation in human iPSCs. Expression levels of immature markers including SSEA4, OCT3/4 and NANOG were indistinguishable between control iPSCs and RB1 knockout iPSCs. Proliferative activity was also unaffected by homozygous RB1 deletion. Taken together, we showed that homozygous deletion of RB1 did not affect the maturation and proliferation statuses of human iPSCs.                © 2020 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.	
32025000        	Early TP53 alterations engage environmental exposures to promote gastric premalignancy in an integrative mouse model.            	Somatic alterations in cancer genes are being detected in normal and premalignant tissue, thus placing greater emphasis on gene-environment interactions that enable disease phenotypes. By combining early genetic alterations with disease-relevant exposures, we developed an integrative mouse model to study gastric premalignancy. Deletion of Trp53 in gastric cells confers a selective advantage and promotes the development of dysplasia in the setting of dietary carcinogens. Organoid derivation from dysplastic lesions facilitated genomic, transcriptional and functional evaluation of gastric premalignancy. Cell cycle regulators, most notably Cdkn2a, were upregulated by p53 inactivation in gastric premalignancy, serving as a barrier to disease progression. Co-deletion of Cdkn2a and Trp53 in dysplastic gastric organoids promoted cancer phenotypes but also induced replication stress, exposing a susceptibility to DNA damage response inhibitors. These findings demonstrate the utility of mouse models that integrate genomic alterations with relevant exposures and highlight the importance of gene-environment interactions in shaping the premalignant state.	
33273595        	Generation of immune cell containing adipose organoids for in vitro analysis of immune metabolism.            	Adipose tissue is an organized endocrine organ with important metabolic and immunological functions and immune cell-adipocyte crosstalk is known to drive various disease pathologies. Suitable 3D adipose tissue organoid models often lack resident immune cell populations and therefore require the addition of immune cells isolated from other organs. We have created the first 3D adipose tissue organoid model which could contain and maintain resident immune cell populations of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and proved to be effective in studying adipose tissue biology in a convenient manner. Macrophage and mast cell populations were successfully confirmed within our organoid model and were maintained in culture without the addition of growth factors. We demonstrated the suitability of our model for monitoring the lipidome during adipocyte differentiation in vitro and confirmed that this model reflects the physiological lipidome better than standard 2D cultures. In addition, we applied mass spectrometry-based lipidomics to track lipidomic changes in the lipidome upon dietary and immunomodulatory interventions. We conclude that this model represents a valuable tool for immune-metabolic research.	
32209571        	Generation of Genetically Engineered Mouse Lung Organoid Models for Squamous Cell Lung Cancers Allows for the Study of Combinatorial Immunotherapy.            	Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a deadly disease for which only a subset of patients responds to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Therefore, preclinical mouse models that recapitulate the complex genetic profile found in patients are urgently needed.                We used CRISPR genome editing to delete multiple tumor suppressors in lung organoids derived from Cre-dependent SOX2 knock-in mice. We investigated both the therapeutic efficacy and immunologic effects accompanying combination PD-1 blockade and WEE1 inhibition in both mouse models and LSCC patient-derived cell lines.                We show that multiplex gene editing of mouse lung organoids using the CRISPR-Cas9 system allows for efficient and rapid means to generate LSCCs that closely mimic the human disease at the genomic and phenotypic level. Using this genetically defined mouse model and three-dimensional tumoroid culture system, we show that WEE1 inhibition induces DNA damage that primes the endogenous type I IFN and antigen presentation system in primary LSCC tumor cells. These events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumor cells and reduce the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating neutrophils. Beneficial immunologic features of WEE1 inhibition are further enhanced by the addition of anti-PD-1 therapy.                We developed a mouse model system to investigate a novel combinatory approach that illuminates a clinical path hypothesis for combining ICB with DNA damage-inducing therapies in the treatment of LSCC.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30925167        	Heterogeneous pathway activation and drug response modelled in colorectal-tumor-derived 3D cultures.            	Organoid cultures derived from colorectal cancer (CRC) samples are increasingly used as preclinical models for studying tumor biology and the effects of targeted therapies under conditions capturing in vitro the genetic make-up of heterogeneous and even individual neoplasms. While 3D cultures are initiated from surgical specimens comprising multiple cell populations, the impact of tumor heterogeneity on drug effects in organoid cultures has not been addressed systematically. Here we have used a cohort of well-characterized CRC organoids to study the influence of tumor heterogeneity on the activity of the KRAS/MAPK-signaling pathway and the consequences of treatment by inhibitors targeting EGFR and downstream effectors. MAPK signaling, analyzed by targeted proteomics, shows unexpected heterogeneity irrespective of RAS mutations and is associated with variable responses to EGFR inhibition. In addition, we obtained evidence for intratumoral heterogeneity in drug response among parallel "sibling" 3D cultures established from a single KRAS-mutant CRC. Our results imply that separate testing of drug effects in multiple subpopulations may help to elucidate molecular correlates of tumor heterogeneity and to improve therapy response prediction in patients.	
33467883        	Convergence of human pluripotent stem cell, organoid, and genome editing technologies.            	The last decade has seen many exciting technological breakthroughs that greatly expanded the toolboxes for biological and biomedical research, yet few have had more impact than induced pluripotent stem cells and modern-day genome editing. These technologies are providing unprecedented opportunities to improve physiological relevance of experimental models, further our understanding of developmental processes, and develop novel therapies. One of the research areas that benefit greatly from these technological advances is the three-dimensional human organoid culture systems that resemble human tissues morphologically and physiologically. Here we summarize the development of human pluripotent stem cells and their differentiation through organoid formation. We further discuss how genetic modifications, genome editing in particular, were applied to answer basic biological and biomedical questions using organoid cultures of both somatic and pluripotent stem cell origins. Finally, we discuss the potential challenges of applying human pluripotent stem cell and organoid technologies for safety and efficiency evaluation of emerging genome editing tools.	
32404074        	Novel methods for in vitro modeling of pancreatic cancer reveal important aspects for successful primary cell culture.            	Pancreatic cancer remains a fatal disease. Experimental systems are needed for personalized treatment strategies, drug testing and to further understand tumor biology. Cell cultures can serve as an excellent preclinical platform, but their generation remains challenging.                Tumor cells from surgically removed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) specimens were cultured under novel protocols. Cellular growth and composition were analyzed and culture conditions were continuously optimized. Characterization of cell cultures and primary tumors was performed via hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining.                Protocols for two- and three-dimensional PDAC primary cell cultures could successfully be established. Primary cell culture depended on dissociation techniques, growth factor supplementation and extracellular matrix components containing Matrigel being crucial for the transformation to three-dimensional PDAC organoids. The generated cultures showed to be highly resemblant to established PDAC primary cell cultures. HE and IF staining for cell culture and corresponding primary tumor characterization could successfully be performed.                The work presented herein shows novel and effective methods to successfully establish primary PDAC cell cultures in a distinct time frame. Factors contributing to cell growth and differentiation could be identified with important implications for further primary cell culture protocols. The established protocols might serve as novel tools in personalized tumor therapy.	
27906177        	'Normalizing' the malignant phenotype of luminal breast cancer cells via alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin.            	Reestablishing tissue organization of breast cancer cells into acini was previously shown to override their malignant phenotype. In our study, we demonstrate that alpha(v)beta(3) integrin (Int-αvβ3), previously shown to play a role in cancer progression, promoted differentiation and growth arrest of organoids derived from luminal A breast cancer cells grown in their relevant three-dimensional microenvironment. These organoids differentiated into normal-like acini resembling a benign stage of breast tissue. Likewise, we demonstrate that Int-αvβ3 is selectively expressed in the epithelium of the benign stage of breast tissues, and is lost during the early stages of luminal A breast cancer progression. Notably, the organoids' reversion into normal-like acini was mediated by cancer luminal progenitor-like cells expressing both EpCAMhighCD49flowCD24+ and Int-αvβ3. Furthermore, downregulation of Notch4 expression and downstream signaling was shown to mediate Int-αvβ3-induced reversion. Intriguingly, when luminal A breast cancer cells expressing Int-αvβ3 were injected into a humanized mouse model, differentiated tumors developed when compared with that generated by control cells. Hence, our data suggest that promoting differentiation of luminal A breast cancer cells by signaling emanating from Int-αvβ3 can potentially promote 'normalization' of their malignant phenotype and may prevent the malignant cells from progressing.

30862718        	Randomly Distributed K14+ Breast Tumor Cells Polarize to the Leading Edge and Guide Collective Migration in Response to Chemical and Mechanical Environmental Cues.            	Collective cell migration is an adaptive, coordinated interactive process involving cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironmental interactions. A critical aspect of collective migration is the sensing and establishment of directional movement. It has been proposed that a subgroup of cells known as leader cells localize at the front edge of a collectively migrating cluster and are responsible for directing migration. However, it is unknown how and when leader cells arrive at the front edge and what environmental cues dictate leader cell development and behavior. Here, we addressed these questions by combining a microfluidic device design that mimics multiple tumor microenvironmental cues concurrently with biologically relevant primary, heterogeneous tumor cell organoids. Prior to migration, breast tumor leader cells (K14+) were present throughout a tumor organoid and migrated (polarized) to the leading edge in response to biochemical and biomechanical cues. Impairment of either CXCR4 (biochemical responsive) or the collagen receptor DDR2 (biomechanical responsive) abrogated polarization of leader cells and directed collective migration. This work demonstrates that K14+ leader cells utilize both chemical and mechanical cues from the microenvironment to polarize to the leading edge of collectively migrating tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that pre-existing, randomly distributed leader cells within primary tumor organoids use CXCR4 and DDR2 to polarize to the leading edge and direct migration.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32259456        	The potential and challenges of patient-derived organoids in guiding the multimodality treatment of upper gastrointestinal malignancies.            	The incidence of adenocarcinoma at the gastrooesophageal junction increased over the last years. Curative treatment for patients with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) malignancies, such as oesophageal and gastric tumours, is challenging and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Radical surgical resection with complete lymphadenectomy is the cornerstone of UGI cancer treatment. Combined with peri-operative treatment (i.e. by applying CROSS, EOX or FLOT regimen), the survival is even better than with surgery alone. However, peri-operative treatment is not effective in all patients, and the most effective strategy is a topic of active debate, as is reflected by varying treatment guidelines between countries. UGI cancers are (epi)genetically highly heterogeneous. It is thus not likely that a uniform treatment will benefit all patients equally well. Over recent years, patient-derived organoids (PDOs) gained more and more interest as an in vitro prediction model that may assist as a diagnostic tool in the future to select and eventually optimize the best peri-operative treatments for each patient. PDOs can be derived from endoscopic tumour biopsies, which maintain heterogeneity in culture. They can be rapidly established and expanded in a relatively short time for in vitro drug screening experiments. This review summarizes the clinical and molecular aspects of oesophageal and gastric tumours, as well as the current progress and remaining challenges in the use of PDOs for drug and radiation screens.

28982714        	Interkinetic nuclear migration and basal tethering facilitates post-mitotic daughter separation in intestinal organoids.            	Homeostasis of renewing tissues requires balanced proliferation, differentiation and movement. This is particularly important in the intestinal epithelium where lineage tracing suggests that stochastic differentiation choices are intricately coupled to the position of a cell relative to a niche. To determine how position is achieved, we followed proliferating cells in intestinal organoids and discovered that the behaviour of mitotic sisters predicted long-term positioning. We found that, normally, 70% of sisters remain neighbours, while 30% lose contact and separate after cytokinesis. These post-mitotic placements predict longer term differences in positions assumed by sisters: adjacent sisters reach similar positions over time; in a pair of separating sisters, one remains close to its birthplace while the other is displaced upward. Computationally modelling crypt dynamics confirmed that post-mitotic separation leads to sisters reaching different compartments. We show that interkinetic nuclear migration, cell size and asymmetric tethering by a process extending from the basal side of cells contribute to separations. These processes are altered in adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) mutant epithelia where separation is lost. We conclude that post-mitotic placement contributes to stochastic niche exit and, when defective, supports the clonal expansion of Apc mutant cells.                © 2017.

33317153        	Current and Future Perspectives of the Use of Organoids in Radiobiology.            	The majority of cancer patients will be treated with radiotherapy, either alone or together with chemotherapy and/or surgery. Optimising the balance between tumour control and the probability of normal tissue side effects is the primary goal of radiation treatment. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the effects that irradiation will have on both normal and cancer tissue. The more classical lab models of immortal cell lines and in vivo animal models have been fundamental to radiobiological studies to date. However, each of these comes with their own limitations and new complementary models are required to fill the gaps left by these traditional models. In this review, we discuss how organoids, three-dimensional tissue-resembling structures derived from tissue-resident, embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells, overcome the limitations of these models and thus have a growing importance in the field of radiation biology research. The roles of organoids in understanding radiation-induced tissue responses and in moving towards precision medicine are examined. Finally, the limitations of organoids in radiobiology and the steps being made to overcome these limitations are considered.	
23711911        	In vitro organoid culture of primary mouse colon tumors.            	Several human and murine colon cancer cell lines have been established, physiologic integrity of colon tumors such as multiple cell layers, basal-apical polarity, ability to differentiate, and anoikis are not maintained in colon cancer derived cell lines. The present study demonstrates a method for culturing primary mouse colon tumor organoids adapted from Sato T et al. (1), which retains important physiologic features of colon tumors. This method consists of mouse colon tumor tissue collection, adjacent normal colon epithelium dissociation, colon tumor cells digestion into single cells, embedding colon tumor cells into matrigel, and selective culture based on the principle that tumor cells maintain growth on limiting nutrient conditions compared to normal epithelial cells. The primary tumor organoids if isolated from genetically modified mice provide a very useful system to assess tumor autonomous function of specific genes. Moreover, the tumor organoids are amenable to genetic manipulation by virus meditated gene delivery; therefore signaling pathways involved in the colon tumorigenesis could also be extensively investigated by overexpression or knockdown. Primary tumor organoids culture provides a physiologic relevant and feasible means to study the mechanisms and therapeutic modalities for colon tumorigenesis.	
33377020        	Introducing the Stem Cell ASCL2 Reporter STAR into Intestinal Organoids.            	Patient-derived organoids maintain functional and phenotypic characteristics of the original tissue such as cell-type diversity. Here, we provide protocols on how to label intestinal (cancer) stem cells by integrating the stem cell ASCL2 reporter (STAR) into human and mouse genomes via two different strategies: (1) lentiviral transduction or (2) transposon-based integration. Organoid technology, in combination with the user-friendly nature of STAR, will facilitate basic research in human and mouse adult stem cell biology.

32864515        	Spin∞: an updated miniaturized spinning bioreactor design for the generation of human cerebral organoids from pluripotent stem cells.            	Three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have become a powerful system to study early development events and to model human disease. Cerebral organoids are generally produced in static culture or in a culture vessel with active mixing, and the two most widely used systems for mixing are a large spinning flask and a miniaturized multi-well spinning bioreactor (also known as Spin Omega (SpinΩ)). The SpinΩ provides a system that is amenable to drug testing, has increased throughput and reproducibility, and utilizes less culture media. However, technical limitations of this system include poor stability of select components and an elevated risk of contamination due to the inability to sterilize the device preassembled. Here, we report a new design of the miniaturized bioreactor system, which we term Spinfinity (Spin∞) that overcomes these concerns to permit long-term experiments. This updated device is amenable to months-long (over 200 days) experiments without concern of unexpected malfunctions.	
28355176        	Visualization and targeting of LGR5+ human colon cancer stem cells.            	The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory highlights a self-renewing subpopulation of cancer cells that fuels tumour growth. The existence of human CSCs is mainly supported by xenotransplantation of prospectively isolated cells, but their clonal dynamics and plasticity remain unclear. Here, we show that human LGR5+ colorectal cancer cells serve as CSCs in growing cancer tissues. Lineage-tracing experiments with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre knock-in allele of LGR5 reveal the self-renewal and differentiation capacity of LGR5+ tumour cells. Selective ablation of LGR5+ CSCs in LGR5-iCaspase9 knock-in organoids leads to tumour regression, followed by tumour regrowth driven by re-emerging LGR5+ CSCs. KRT20 knock-in reporter marks differentiated cancer cells that constantly diminish in tumour tissues, while reverting to LGR5+ CSCs and contributing to tumour regrowth after LGR5+ CSC ablation. We also show that combined chemotherapy potentiates targeting of LGR5+ CSCs. These data provide insights into the plasticity of CSCs and their potential as a therapeutic target in human colorectal cancer.	
27446916        	Personalized Medicine Approaches in Prostate Cancer Employing Patient Derived 3D Organoids and Humanized Mice.            	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer death in Western men. Despite its prevalence, PCa has proven very difficult to propagate in vitro. PCa represents a complex organ-like multicellular structure maintained by the dynamic interaction of tumoral cells with parenchymal stroma, endothelial and immune cells, and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The lack of PCa models that recapitulate this intricate system has hampered progress toward understanding disease progression and lackluster therapeutic responses. Tissue slices, monolayer cultures and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) fail to mimic the complexities of the PCa microenvironment or reproduce the diverse mechanisms of therapy resistance. Moreover, patient derived xenografts (PDXs) are expensive, time consuming, difficult to establish for prostate cancer, lack immune cell-tumor regulation, and often tumors undergo selective engraftments. Here, we describe an interdisciplinary approach using primary PCa and tumor initiating cells (TICs), three-dimensional (3D) tissue engineering, genetic and morphometric profiling, and humanized mice to generate patient-derived organoids for examining personalized therapeutic responses in vitro and in mice co-engrafted with a human immune system (HIS), employing adaptive T-cell- and chimeric antigen receptor- (CAR) immunotherapy. The development of patient specific therapies targeting the vulnerabilities of cancer, when combined with antiproliferative and immunotherapy approaches could help to achieve the full transformative power of cancer precision medicine.	
30508510        	Interleukin 1 Up-regulates MicroRNA 135b to Promote Inflammation-Associated Gastric Carcinogenesis in Mice.            	Gastritis is associated with development of stomach cancer, but little is known about changes in microRNA expression patterns during gastric inflammation. Specific changes in gene expression in epithelial cells are difficult to monitor because of the heterogeneity of the tissue. We investigated epithelial cell-specific changes in microRNA expression during gastric inflammation and gastritis-associated carcinogenesis in mice.                We used laser microdissection to enrich epithelial cells from K19-C2mE transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop gastritis-associated hyperplasia, and Gan mice, which express activated prostaglandin E2 and Wnt in the gastric mucosa and develop gastric tumors. We measured expression of epithelial cell-enriched microRNAs and used bioinformatics analyses to integrate data from different systems to identify inflammation-associated microRNAs. We validated our findings in gastric tissues from mice and evaluated protein functions in gastric cell lines (SNU-719, SNU-601, SNU-638, AGS, and GIF-14) and knockout mice. Organoids were cultured from gastric corpus tissues of wild-type and miR-135b-knockout C57BL/6 mice. We measured levels of microRNAs in pairs of gastric tumors and nontumor mucosa from 28 patients in Japan.                We found microRNA 135b (miR-135B) to be the most overexpressed microRNA in gastric tissues from K19-C2mE and Gan mice: levels increased during the early stages of gastritis-associated carcinogenesis. Levels of miR-135B were also increased in gastric tumor tissues from gp130F/F mice and patients compared with nontumor tissues. In gastric organoids and immortalized cell lines, expression of miR-135B was induced by interleukin 1 signaling. K19-C2mE mice with disruption of Mir-135b developed hyperplastic lesions that were 50% smaller than mice without Mir-135b disruption and had significant reductions in cell proliferation. Expression of miR-135B in gastric cancer cell lines increased their colony formation, migration, and sphere formation. We identified FOXN3 and RECK messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as targets of miR-135B; their knockdown reduced migration of gastric cancer cell lines. Levels of FOXN3 and RECK mRNAs correlated inversely with levels of miR-135B in human gastric tumors and in inflamed mucosa from K19-C2mE mice.                We found expression of miR-135B to be up-regulated by interleukin L1 signaling in gastric cancer cells and organoids. miR-135B promotes invasiveness and stem-cell features of gastric cancer cells in culture by reducing FOXN3 and RECK messenger RNAs. Levels of these messenger RNA targets, which encode tumor suppressor, are reduced in human gastric tumors.                Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

30414058        	Isolation, Propagation, and Clonogenicity of Intestinal Stem Cells.            	Intestinal stem cell research has greatly aided our understanding of the biology of intestinal self-renewal but has also shed light on the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in carcinogenesis, cancer growth, and dissemination. With new possibilities for CSC targeting, there is a need to have established techniques for quantifying (cancer) stem cell clonogenicity, particularly in organoid cultures. Here, we describe a detailed methodology for the isolation and expansion of mouse intestinal crypts from three different locations-the colon, proximal, and distal small intestine. In addition, we describe techniques that allow the measurement of stem cell clonogenicity and its manipulation using two approaches-organoid counting and immunohistochemistry.	
31063751        	Modeling Cancer with Flies and Fish.            	Cancer has joined heart disease as the leading source of mortality in the US. In an era of organoids, patient-derived xenografts, and organs on a chip, model organisms continue to thrive with a combination of powerful genetic tools, rapid pace of discovery, and affordability. Model organisms enable the analysis of both the tumor and its associated microenvironment, aspects that are particularly relevant to our understanding of metastasis and drug resistance. In this Perspective, we explore some of the strengths of fruit flies and zebrafish for addressing fundamental cancer questions and how these two organisms can contribute to identifying promising therapeutic candidates.

33495862        	Paediatric gastric organoids as a tool for disease modelling and clinical translation.            	Knowledge of gastric epithelial homeostasis remains incomplete, lacking human-specific models for study. This study establishes a protocol for deriving gastric epithelial organoids from paediatric gastric biopsies, providing a platform for modelling disease and developing translational therapies.                Full-thickness surgical samples and endoscopic mucosal biopsies were obtained from six patients. Gastric glands were isolated by a chemical chelation protocol and then plated in 3D culture in Matrigel® droplets in chemically defined medium. After formation, organoids were passaged by single cell dissociation or manual disaggregation. Cell composition and epithelial polarity of organoids were assessed by bright field microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis, comparing them to native paediatric gastric tissue.                Gastric glands were successfully isolated from all six patients who were aged 4 months to 16 years. Gastric glands from all patients sealed to form spherical gastric organoids. These organoids could be passaged by manual disaggregation or single cell dissociation, remaining proliferative up to 1 year in culture. Organoids retained normal epithelial cell polarity, with the apical surface orientated towards the central lumen. Organoids expressed markers of mature gastric epithelial cell types, except for parietal cells.                Gastric organoids can be reliably generated from paediatric biopsies and are a representative in vitro model for studying gastric epithelium.	
27181203        	p27T187A knockin identifies Skp2/Cks1 pocket inhibitors for advanced prostate cancer.            	SCFSkp2/Cks1 ubiquitinates Thr187-phosphorylated p27 for degradation. Overexpression of Skp2 coupled with underexpression of p27 are frequent characteristics of cancer cells. When the role of SCFSkp2/Cks1-mediated p27 ubiquitination in cancer was specifically tested by p27 Thr187-to-Ala knockin (p27T187A KI), it was found dispensable for KrasG12D-induced lung tumorigenesis but essential for Rb1-deficient pituitary tumorigenesis. Here we identify pRb and p53 doubly deficient (DKO) prostate tumorigenesis as a context in which p27 ubiquitination by SCFSkp2/Cks1 is required for p27 downregulation. p27 protein accumulated in prostate when p27T187A KI mice underwent DKO prostate tumorigenesis. p27T187A KI or Skp2 knockdown (KD) induced similar degrees of p27 protein accumulation in DKO prostate cells, and Skp2 KD did not further increase p27 protein in DKO prostate cells that contained p27T187A KI (AADKO prostate cells). p27T187A KI activated an E2F1-p73-apoptosis axis in DKO prostate tumorigenesis, slowed disease progression and significantly extended survival. Querying co-occurrence relationships among RB1, TP53, PTEN, NKX3-1 and MYC in TCGA of prostate cancer identified co-inactivation of RB1 and TP53 as the only statistically significant co-occurrences in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Together, our study identifies Skp2/Cks1 pocket inhibitors as potential therapeutics for mCRPC. Procedures for establishing mCRPC organoid cultures from contemporary patients were recently established. An Skp2/Cks1 pocket inhibitor preferentially collapsed DKO prostate tumor organoids over AADKO organoids, which spontaneously disintegrated over time when DKO prostate tumor organoids grew larger, setting the stage to translate mouse model findings to precision medicine in the clinic on the organoid platform.	
30080881        	Canonical PRC2 function is essential for mammary gland development and affects chromatin compaction in mammary organoids.            	Distinct transcriptional states are maintained through organization of chromatin, resulting from the sum of numerous repressive and active histone modifications, into tightly packaged heterochromatin versus more accessible euchromatin. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is the main mammalian complex responsible for histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and is integral to chromatin organization. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, we show that deletion of Suz12, a core component of all PRC2 complexes, results in loss of H3K27me3 and H3K27 dimethylation (H3K27me2), completely blocks normal mammary gland development, and profoundly curtails progenitor activity in 3D organoid cultures. Through the application of mammary organoids to bypass the severe phenotype associated with Suz12 loss in vivo, we have explored gene expression and chromatin structure in wild-type and Suz12-deleted basal-derived organoids. Analysis of organoids led to the identification of lineage-specific changes in gene expression and chromatin structure, inferring cell type-specific PRC2-mediated gene silencing of the chromatin state. These expression changes were accompanied by cell cycle arrest but not lineage infidelity. Together, these data indicate that canonical PRC2 function is essential for development of the mammary gland through the repression of alternate transcription programs and maintenance of chromatin states.	
32690136        	Tracking cells in epithelial acini by light sheet microscopy reveals proximity effects in breast cancer initiation.            	Cancer clone evolution takes place within tissue ecosystem habitats. But, how exactly tumors arise from a few malignant cells within an intact epithelium is a central, yet unanswered question. This is mainly due to the inaccessibility of this process to longitudinal imaging together with a lack of systems that model the progression of a fraction of transformed cells within a tissue. Here, we developed a new methodology based on primary mouse mammary epithelial acini, where oncogenes can be switched on in single cells within an otherwise normal epithelial cell layer. We combine this stochastic breast tumor induction model with inverted light-sheet imaging to study single-cell behavior for up to four days and analyze cell fates utilizing a newly developed image-data analysis workflow. The power of this integrated approach is illustrated by us finding that small local clusters of transformed cells form tumors while isolated transformed cells do not.                © 2020, Alladin et al.

32686876        	Basal-like and classical cells coexist in pancreatic cancer revealed by single-cell analysis on biopsy-derived pancreatic cancer organoids from the classical subtype.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is composed of stromal, immune, and cancerous epithelial cells. Transcriptomic analysis of the epithelial compartment allows classification into different phenotypic subtypes as classical and basal-like. However, little is known about the intra-tumor heterogeneity particularly in the epithelial compartment. Growing evidences suggest that this phenotypic segregation is not so precise and different cancerous cell types may coexist in a single tumor. To test this hypothesis, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analyses using combinational barcoding exclusively on epithelial cells from six different classical PDAC patients obtained by Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) with Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). To purify the epithelial compartment, PDAC were grown as biopsy-derived pancreatic cancer organoids. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis allowed the identification of four main cell clusters present in different proportions in all tumors. Remarkably, although all these tumors were classified as classical, one cluster present in all corresponded to a basal-like phenotype. These results reveal an unanticipated high heterogeneity of pancreatic cancers and demonstrate that basal-like cells, which have a highly aggressive phenotype, are more widespread than expected.                © 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.	
30692572        	Differential anti-tumour effects of MTH1 inhibitors in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures.            	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as second messengers in signal transduction, but high ROS levels can also cause cell death. MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation - conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels - increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms.	
30218018        	A combination of curcumin and oligomeric proanthocyanidins offer superior anti-tumorigenic properties in colorectal cancer.            	Combining anti-cancer agents in cancer therapies is becoming increasingly popular due to improved efficacy, reduced toxicity and decreased emergence of resistance. Here, we test the hypothesis that dietary agents such as oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) and curcumin cooperatively modulate cancer-associated cellular mechanisms to inhibit carcinogenesis. By a series of in vitro assays in colorectal cancer cell lines, we showed that the anti-tumorigenic properties of the OPCs-curcumin combination were superior to the effects of individual compounds. By RNA-sequencing based gene-expression profiling in six colorectal cancer cell lines, we identified the cooperative modulation of key cancer-associated pathways such as DNA replication and cell cycle pathways. Moreover, several pathways, including protein export, glutathione metabolism and porphyrin metabolism were more effectively modulated by the combination of OPCs and curcumin. We validated genes belonging to these pathways, such as HSPA5, SEC61B, G6PD, HMOX1 and PDE3B to be cooperatively modulated by the OPCs-curcumin combination. We further confirmed that the OPCs-curcumin combination more potently suppresses colorectal carcinogenesis and modulated expression of genes identified by RNA-sequencing in mice xenografts and in colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids. Overall, by delineating the cooperative mechanisms of action of OPCs and curcumin, we make a case for the clinical co-administration of curcumin and OPCs as a treatment therapy for patients with colorectal cancer.

30724425        	IFN/STAT signaling controls tumorigenesis and the drug response in colorectal cancer.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is caused by genetic alterations, and comprehensive sequence analyses have revealed the mutation landscapes. In addition to somatic changes, genetic variations are considered important factors contributing to tumor development; however, our knowledge on this subject is limited. Familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. FAP patients are classified into two major groups based on clinical manifestations: classical FAP (CFAP) and attenuated FAP (AFAP). In this study, we established 42 organoids from three CFAP patients and two AFAP patients. Comprehensive gene expression analysis demonstrated a close association between IFN/STAT signaling and the phenotypic features of FAP patients. Genetic disruption of Stat1 in the mouse model of FAP reduced tumor formation, demonstrating that the IFN/STAT pathway is causally associated with the tumor-forming potential of APC-deficient tumors. Mechanistically, STAT1 is downstream target of KRAS and is phosphorylated by its activating mutations. We found that enhanced IFN/STAT signaling in CFAP conferred resistance to MEK inhibitors. These findings reveal the crosstalk between RAS signaling and IFN/STAT signaling, which contributes to the tumor-forming potential and drug response. These results offer a rationale for targeting of IFN/STAT signaling and for the stratification of CRC patients.                © 2019 The Authors.

30261339        	Cellulose-based scaffolds for fluorescence lifetime imaging-assisted tissue engineering.            	Quantitative measurement of pH and metabolite gradients by microscopy is one of the challenges in the production of scaffold-grown organoids and multicellular aggregates. Herein, we used the cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of the Cellulomonas fimi CenA protein for designing biosensor scaffolds that allow measurement of pH and Ca2+ gradients by fluorescence intensity and lifetime imaging (FLIM) detection modes. By fusing CBD with pH-sensitive enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CBD-ECFP), we achieved efficient labeling of cellulose-based scaffolds based on nanofibrillar, bacterial cellulose, and decellularized plant materials. CBD-ECFP bound to the cellulose matrices demonstrated pH sensitivity comparable to untagged ECFP (1.9-2.3 ns for pH 6-8), thus making it compatible with FLIM-based analysis of extracellular pH. By using 3D culture of human colon cancer cells (HCT116) and adult stem cell-derived mouse intestinal organoids, we evaluated the utility of the produced biosensor scaffold. CBD-ECFP was sensitive to increases in extracellular acidification: the results showed a decline in 0.2-0.4 pH units in response to membrane depolarization by the protonophore FCCP. With the intestinal organoid model, we demonstrated multiparametric imaging by combining extracellular acidification (FLIM) with phosphorescent probe-based monitoring of cell oxygenation. The described labeling strategy allows for the design of extracellular pH-sensitive scaffolds for multiparametric FLIM assays and their use in engineered live cancer and stem cell-derived tissues. Collectively, this research can help in achieving the controlled biofabrication of 3D tissue models with known metabolic characteristics. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We designed biosensors consisting of a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) and pH- and Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent proteins. CBD-tagged biosensors efficiently label various types of cellulose matrices including nanofibrillar cellulose and decellularized plant materials. Hybrid biosensing cellulose scaffolds designed in this study were successfully tested by multiparameter FLIM microscopy in 3D cultures of cancer cells and mouse intestinal organoids.

27221051        	TGFβ signaling directs serrated adenomas to the mesenchymal colorectal cancer subtype.            	The heterogeneous nature of colorectal cancer (CRC) complicates prognosis and is suggested to be a determining factor in the efficacy of adjuvant therapy for individual patients. Based on gene expression profiling, CRC is currently classified into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs), characterized by specific biological programs, thus suggesting the existence of unifying developmental drivers for each CMS Using human organoid cultures, we investigated the role of such developmental drivers at the premalignant stage of distinct CRC subtypes and found that TGFβ plays an important role in the development of the mesenchymal CMS4, which is of special interest due to its association with dismal prognosis. We show that in tubular adenomas (TAs), which progress to classical CRCs, the dominating response to TGFβ is death by apoptosis. By contrast, induction of a mesenchymal phenotype upon TGFβ treatment prevails in a genetically engineered organoid culture carrying a BRAF(V) (600E) mutation, constituting a model system for sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs). Our data indicate that TGFβ signaling is already active in SSA precursor lesions and that TGFβ is a critical cue for directing SSAs to the mesenchymal, poor-prognosis CMS4 of CRC.                © 2016 The Authors.

27653681        	Mammary-Stem-Cell-Based Somatic Mouse Models Reveal Breast Cancer Drivers Causing Cell Fate Dysregulation.            	Cancer genomics has provided an unprecedented opportunity for understanding genetic causes of human cancer. However, distinguishing which mutations are functionally relevant to cancer pathogenesis remains a major challenge. We describe here a mammary stem cell (MaSC) organoid-based approach for rapid generation of somatic genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). By using RNAi and CRISPR-mediated genome engineering in MaSC-GEMMs, we have discovered that inactivation of Ptpn22 or Mll3, two genes mutated in human breast cancer, greatly accelerated PI3K-driven mammary tumorigenesis. Using these tumor models, we have also identified genetic alterations promoting tumor metastasis and causing resistance to PI3K-targeted therapy. Both Ptpn22 and Mll3 inactivation resulted in disruption of mammary gland differentiation and an increase in stem cell activity. Mechanistically, Mll3 deletion enhanced stem cell activity through activation of the HIF pathway. Thus, our study has established a robust in vivo platform for functional cancer genomics and has discovered functional breast cancer mutations.                Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

32843642        	Regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and organoid morphogenesis by a novel TGFβ-TCF7L2 isoform-specific signaling pathway.            	Alternative splicing contributes to diversification of gene function, yet consequences of splicing on functions of specific gene products is poorly understood. The major transcription factor TCF7L2 undergoes alternative splicing but the biological significance of TCF7L2 isoforms has remained largely to be elucidated. Here, we find that the TCF7L2 E-isoforms maintain, whereas the M and S isoforms disrupt morphogenesis of 3D-epithelial cell-derived organoids via regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Remarkably, TCF7L2E2 antagonizes, whereas TCF7L2M2/S2 promotes EMT-like effects in epithelial cells induced by transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling. In addition, we find TGFβ signaling reduces the proportion of TCF7L2E to TCF7L2M/S protein in cells undergoing EMT. We also find that TCF7L2 operates via TGFβ-Smad3 signaling to regulate EMT. Collectively, our findings unveil novel isoform-specific functions for the major transcription factor TCF7L2 and provide novel links between TCF7L2 and TGFβ signaling in the control of EMT-like responses and epithelial tissue morphogenesis.	
28297567        	Developing a Novel Two-Dimensional Culture System to Enrich Human Prostate Luminal Progenitors that Can Function as a Cell of Origin for Prostate Cancer.            	Elucidating the cell of origin of cancer has great significance in stratifying patients into appropriate treatment groups and for developing novel targeted therapies. Early studies demonstrate that only stem-like basal cells in the normal human prostate (NHP) can function as the cell of origin for prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we show that the organoids derived from bulk NHP luminal cells can also be tumorigenically transformed. We further show that the WIT medium, which is used to culture human mammary epithelial progenitor cells, when combined with the ROCK inhibitor, can readily propagate a population of progenitor-like cells from the primary NHP luminal cell isolates. Such functionally defined luminal progenitors can be transformed by distinct sets of genetic perturbations (i.e., AR+AKT/ERG or c-MYC+PTEN knockout) to form tumor glands. Genome-wide RNA-Seq analysis of freshly purified unperturbed human benign prostatic basal and luminal cells and culture-expanded lineage-specific stem/progenitor populations reveals that the luminal progenitors possess a distinct gene expression profile that is greatly enriched in advanced, castration-resistant, and metastatic PCa, and it associates with poor patient survival. The ability of the simple two-dimensional culture system reported herein to greatly enrich NHP progenitor-like cells should facilitate biological and biochemical studies as well as high-throughput screening in these cells and in progenitor-like PCa cells.

32705654        	Modeling Colorectal Cancer Progression Through Orthotopic Implantation of Organoids.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) related death has often been attributed to the presence of metastatic disseminated disease. A concise understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) that drive metastatic progression is therefore needed but has thus far been hampered by the limited number of CRC mouse models that progress toward this disease stage. In addition, preclinical evaluation of therapeutic modalities aimed at managing metastatic disease also rests on the availability of relevant in vivo models that faithfully recapitulate the key molecular features of metastatic human CRC. To overcome these limitations, we have recently developed methodologies that enable the study of CRC progression at relevant orthotopic sites. Here, we provide a detailed methodology that describes the injection of CRC derived cell lines and organoids directly into the colorectal mucosa. This results in the growth of a single tumor mass within the colon, that can spontaneously metastasize to the liver. Furthermore, we also present a surgical procedure to directly inject cells into the portal venous circulation to induce CRC tumor growth in the liver without the requirement of a primary tumor.	
33407519        	Bacteria-derived ferrichrome inhibits tumor progression in sporadic colorectal neoplasms and colitis-associated cancer.            	Colorectal cancers develop through several pathways, including the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and colitis-associated carcinogenesis. An altered intestinal microflora has been reported to be associated with the development and progression of colorectal cancer via these pathways. We identified Lactobacillus casei-derived ferrichrome as a mediator of the bacterial anti-tumor effect of colorectal cancer cells through the upregulation of DDIT3. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of ferrichrome on precancerous conditions and cancer cells associated with sporadic as well as colitis-associated colorectal cancer.                SRB and MTT assays were performed to assess growth inhibition in vitro. Eighteen organoids were prepared from biopsy specimens obtained by colonoscopy. An AOM-DSS carcinogenesis model and xenograft model of colorectal cancer cells were generated for the assessment of the tumor suppressive effect of ferrichrome in vivo.                Ferrichrome inhibited the cell growth of colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in in vivo xenograft models. Ferrichrome exerted a strong tumor-suppressive effect that was superior to that of currently available anti-tumor agents, including 5-FU and cisplatin, both in vitro and in vivo. The tumor-suppressive effect of the combination of ferrichrome and 5-FU was superior to that of single treatment with either drug. The tumor suppressive effects of ferrichrome were confirmed through the upregulation of DDIT3 in patient-derived organoids of adenoma and carcinoma. Ferrichrome inhibited the tumor progression in the AOM-DSS model while exhibiting no anti-inflammatory effect in the DSS-colitis model, suggesting that ferrichrome inhibited cancer cells, but not a precancerous condition, via the colitis-associated pathway.                Ferrichrome exerts a tumor suppressive effect on precancerous conditions and cancer cells associated with sporadic as well as colitis-associated colorectal cancer. The anti-tumor effect of ferrichrome was mediated by the upregulation of DDIT3, and was superior to that of 5-FU or cisplatin. These results suggest that Lactobacillus brevis-derived ferrichrome may be a candidate anti-tumor drug for the treatment of colorectal neoplasms.	
27322743        	RANK ligand as a potential target for breast cancer prevention in BRCA1-mutation carriers.            	Individuals who have mutations in the breast-cancer-susceptibility gene BRCA1 (hereafter referred to as BRCA1-mutation carriers) frequently undergo prophylactic mastectomy to minimize their risk of breast cancer. The identification of an effective prevention therapy therefore remains a 'holy grail' for the field. Precancerous BRCA1(mut/+) tissue harbors an aberrant population of luminal progenitor cells, and deregulated progesterone signaling has been implicated in BRCA1-associated oncogenesis. Coupled with the findings that tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11; also known as RANKL) is a key paracrine effector of progesterone signaling and that RANKL and its receptor TNFRSF11A (also known as RANK) contribute to mammary tumorigenesis, we investigated a role for this pathway in the pre-neoplastic phase of BRCA1-mutation carriers. We identified two subsets of luminal progenitors (RANK(+) and RANK(-)) in histologically normal tissue of BRCA1-mutation carriers and showed that RANK(+) cells are highly proliferative, have grossly aberrant DNA repair and bear a molecular signature similar to that of basal-like breast cancer. These data suggest that RANK(+) and not RANK(-) progenitors are a key target population in these women. Inhibition of RANKL signaling by treatment with denosumab in three-dimensional breast organoids derived from pre-neoplastic BRCA1(mut/+) tissue attenuated progesterone-induced proliferation. Notably, proliferation was markedly reduced in breast biopsies from BRCA1-mutation carriers who were treated with denosumab. Furthermore, inhibition of RANKL in a Brca1-deficient mouse model substantially curtailed mammary tumorigenesis. Taken together, these findings identify a targetable pathway in a putative cell-of-origin population in BRCA1-mutation carriers and implicate RANKL blockade as a promising strategy in the prevention of breast cancer.	
32697306        	Endometrial Organoids: A New Model for the Research of Endometrial-Related Diseases†.            	An ideal research model plays a vital role in studying the pathogenesis of a disease. At present, the most widely used endometrial disease models are cell lines and animal models. As a novel studying model, organoids have already been applied for the study of various diseases, such as disorders related to the liver, small intestine, colon, and pancreas, and have been extended to the endometrium. After a long period of exploration by predecessors, endometrial organoids (EOs) technology has gradually matured and maintained genetic and phenotypic stability after long-term expansion. Compared with cell lines and animal models, EOs have high stability and patient specificity. These not only effectively and veritably reflects the pathophysiology of a disease, but also can be used in preclinical drug screening, combined with patient derived xenografts (PDXs). Indeed, there are still many limitations for EOs. For example, the co-culture system of EOs with stromal cells, immune cell, or vascular cells is not mature, and endometrial cancer organoids have a lower success rate, which should be improved in the future. The investigators predict that EOs will play a significant role in the study of endometrium-related diseases.                © The Author(s) 2020.

29785035        	Optimized delivery of siRNA into 3D tumor spheroid cultures in situ.            	3D tissue culture provides a physiologically relevant and genetically tractable system for studying normal and malignant human tissues. Despite this, gene-silencing studies using siRNA has proved difficult. In this study, we have identified a cause for why traditional siRNA transfection techniques are ineffective in eliciting gene silencing in situ within 3D cultures and proposed a simple method for significantly enhancing siRNA entry into spheroids/organoids. In 2D cell culture, the efficiency of gene silencing is significantly reduced when siRNA complexes are prepared in the presence of serum. Surprisingly, in both 3D tumour spheroids and primary murine organoids, the presence of serum during siRNA preparation rapidly promotes entry and internalization of Cy3-labelled siRNA in under 2 hours. Conversely, siRNA prepared in traditional low-serum transfection media fails to gain matrigel or spheroid/organoid entry. Direct measurement of CTNNB1 mRNA (encoding β-catenin) from transfected tumour spheroids confirmed a transient but significant knockdown of β-catenin when siRNA:liposome complexes were formed with serum, but not when prepared in the presence of reduced-serum media (Opti-MEM). Our studies suggest a simple modification to standard lipid-based transfection protocols facilitates rapid siRNA entry and transient gene repression, providing a platform for researchers to improve siRNA efficiency in established 3D cultures.	
30858928        	CRISPR-induced RASGAP deficiencies in colorectal cancer organoids reveal that only loss of NF1 promotes resistance to EGFR inhibition.            	Anti-EGFR therapy is used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, for which initial response rates of 10-20% have been achieved. Although the presence of HER2 amplifications and oncogenic mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF are associated with EGFR-targeted therapy resistance, for a large population of CRC patients the underlying mechanism of RAS-MEK-ERK hyperactivation is not clear. Loss-of-function mutations in RASGAPs are often speculated in literature to promote CRC growth as being negative regulators of RAS, but direct experimental evidence is lacking. We generated a CRISPR-mediated knock out panel of all RASGAPs in patient-derived CRC organoids and found that only loss of NF1, but no other RASGAPs e.g. RASA1, results in enhanced RAS-ERK signal amplification and improved tolerance towards limited EGF stimulation. Our data suggests that NF1-deficient CRCs are likely not responsive to anti-EGFR monotherapy and can potentially function as a biomarker for CRC progression.	
27869803        	Genome-wide CRISPR screens reveal a Wnt-FZD5 signaling circuit as a druggable vulnerability of RNF43-mutant pancreatic tumors.            	Forward genetic screens with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing enable high-resolution detection of genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in RNF43-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, which rely on Wnt signaling for proliferation. Through these screens, we discovered a unique requirement for a Wnt signaling circuit: engaging FZD5, one of the ten Frizzled receptors encoded in the human genome. Our results uncover an underappreciated level of context-dependent specificity at the Wnt receptor level. We further derived a panel of recombinant antibodies that reports the expression of nine FZD proteins and confirms that FZD5 functional specificity cannot be explained by protein expression patterns. Additionally, antibodies that specifically bind FZD5 and FZD8 robustly inhibited the growth of RNF43-mutant PDAC cells grown in vitro and as xenografts in vivo, providing orthogonal support for the functional specificity observed genetically. Proliferation of a patient-derived PDAC cell line harboring an RNF43 variant was also selectively inhibited by the FZD5 antibodies, further demonstrating their use as a potential targeted therapy. Tumor organoid cultures from colorectal carcinoma patients that carried RNF43 mutations were also sensitive to the FZD5 antibodies, highlighting the potential generalizability of these findings beyond PDAC. Our results show that CRIPSR-based genetic screens can be leveraged to identify and validate cell surface targets for antibody development and therapy.	
32614802        	Implementing cell-free DNA of pancreatic cancer patient-derived organoids for personalized oncology.            	One of the major challenges in using pancreatic cancer patient-derived organoids (PDOs) in precision oncology is the time from biopsy to functional characterization. This is particularly true for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies, typically resulting in specimens with limited tumor cell yield. Here, we tested conditioned media of individual PDOs for cell-free DNA to detect driver mutations already early on during the expansion process to accelerate the genetic characterization of PDOs as well as subsequent functional testing. Importantly, genetic alterations detected in the PDO supernatant, collected as early as 72 hours after biopsy, recapitulate the mutational profile of the primary tumor, indicating suitability of this approach to subject PDOs to drug testing in a reduced time frame. In addition, we demonstrated that this workflow was practicable, even in patients for whom the amount of tumor material was not sufficient for molecular characterization by established means. Together, our findings demonstrate that generating PDOs from very limited biopsy material permits molecular profiling and drug testing. With our approach, this can be achieved in a rapid and feasible fashion with broad implications in clinical practice.	
33361335        	The chromatin landscape of primary synovial sarcoma organoids is linked to specific epigenetic mechanisms and dependencies.            	Synovial sarcoma (SyS) is an aggressive mesenchymal malignancy invariably associated with the chromosomal translocation t(X:18; p11:q11), which results in the in-frame fusion of the BAF complex gene SS18 to one of three SSX genes. Fusion of SS18 to SSX generates an aberrant transcriptional regulator, which, in permissive cells, drives tumor development by initiating major chromatin remodeling events that disrupt the balance between BAF-mediated gene activation and polycomb-dependent repression. Here, we developed SyS organoids and performed genome-wide epigenomic profiling of these models and mesenchymal precursors to define SyS-specific chromatin remodeling mechanisms and dependencies. We show that SS18-SSX induces broad BAF domains at its binding sites, which oppose polycomb repressor complex (PRC) 2 activity, while facilitating recruitment of a non-canonical (nc)PRC1 variant. Along with the uncoupling of polycomb complexes, we observed H3K27me3 eviction, H2AK119ub deposition and the establishment of de novo active regulatory elements that drive SyS identity. These alterations are completely reversible upon SS18-SSX depletion and are associated with vulnerability to USP7 loss, a core member of ncPRC1.1. Using the power of primary tumor organoids, our work helps define the mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation on which SyS cells are dependent.                © 2020 Boulay et al.	
32532289        	A novel patient-derived organoids-based xenografts model for preclinical drug response testing in patients with colorectal liver metastases.            	Cancer-related mortality in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is predominantly caused by development of colorectal liver metastases (CLMs). How to screen the sensitive chemotherapy and targeted therapy is the key element to improve the prognosis of CLMs patients. The study aims to develop patient-derived organoids-based xenografted liver metastases (PDOX-LM) model of CRC, to recapitulate the clinical drug response.                We transplanted human CRC primary tumor derived organoids in murine spleen to obtain xenografted liver metastases in murine liver. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, whole-exome and RNA sequencing, and drug response testing were utilized to identify the homogeneity in biological and genetic characteristics, and drug response between the PDOX-LM models and donor liver metastases.                We successfully established PDOX-LM models from patients with CLMs. IHC staining showed that positive expression of CEA, Ki67, VEGF, FGFR2 in donor liver metastases were also well preserved in matched xenografted liver metastases. Whole-exon sequencing and transcriptome analysis showed that both xenografted and donor liver metastases were highly concordant in somatic variants (≥ 0.90 frequency of concordance) and co-expression of driver genes (Pearson's correlation coefficient reach up to 0.99, P = 0.001). Furthermore, drug response testing showed that the PDOX-LM models can closely recapitulated the clinical response to mFOLFOX6 regiments.                This PDOX-LM model provides a more convenient and informative platform for preclinical testing of individual tumors by retaining the histologic and genetic features of donor liver metastases. This technology holds great promise to predict treatment sensitivity for patients with CLMs undergoing chemotherapy.	
32602046        	Long Term Culture of Human Kidney Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells Maintains Lineage Functions and Serves as an Ex vivo Model for Coronavirus Associated Kidney Injury.            	The mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 causes severe multi-organ failure is largely unknown. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the frequent organ damage in severe COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that human renal tubule cells could be the potential host cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Traditional cancer cell lines or immortalized cell lines are genetically and phenotypically different from host cells. Animal models are widely used, but often fail to reflect a physiological and pathogenic status because of species tropisms. There is an unmet need for normal human epithelial cells for disease modeling. In this study, we successfully established long term cultures of normal human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (KPTECs) in 2D and 3D culture systems using conditional reprogramming (CR) and organoids techniques. These cells had the ability to differentiate and repair DNA damage, and showed no transforming property. Importantly, the CR KPTECs maintained lineage function with expression of specific transporters (SLC34A3 and cubilin). They also expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, cancer cell line did not express endogenous SLC34A3, cubilin and ACE2. Very interestingly, ACE2 expression was around twofold higher in 3D organoids culture compared to that in 2D CR culture condition. Pseudovirion assays demonstrated that SARS-CoV spike (S) protein was able to enter CR cells with luciferase reporter. This integrated 2D CR and 3D organoid cultures provide a physiological ex vivo model to study kidney functions, innate immune response of kidney cells to viruses, and a novel platform for drug discovery and safety evaluation.	
33195205        	Epidermal Growth Factor Is Essential for the Maintenance of Novel Prostate Epithelial Cells Isolated From Patient-Derived Organoids.            	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity among males worldwide. Deciphering the biological mechanisms and molecular pathways involved in PCa pathogenesis and progression has been hindered by numerous technical limitations mainly attributed to the limited number of cell lines available, which do not recapitulate the diverse phenotypes of clinical disease. Indeed, PCa has proven problematic to establish as cell lines in culture due to its heterogeneity which remains a challenge, despite the various in vitro and in vivo model systems available. Growth factors have been shown to play a central role in the complex regulation of cell proliferation among hormone sensitive tumors, such as PCa. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of novel patient-derived prostate epithelial (which we named as AUB-PrC) cells from organoids culture system. We also assessed the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in culturing those cells. We profiled the AUB-PrC cells isolated from unaffected and tumor patient samples via depicting their molecular and epithelial lineage features through immunofluorescence staining and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), as well as through functional assays and transcriptomic profiling through RNA sequencing. In addition, by optimizing a previously established prostate organoids culture system, we were able to grow human prostate epithelial cells using growth medium and EGF only. With these data collected, we were able to gain insight at the molecular architecture of novel human AUB-PrC cells, which might pave the way for deciphering the mechanisms that lead to PCa development and progression, and ultimately improving prognostic abilities and treatments.

30915124        	Remodelling and Improvements in Organoid Technology to Study Liver Carcinogenesis in a Dish.            	Primary liver cancer (PLC) is the sixth most common tumour disease and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. The two most common types of PLC are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Diverse subgroups are described and a manifold number of gene mutations are known. Asymptomatic disease progression and limited therapeutic options are the reasons for the high mortality rate in PLC. Up to date, the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and lenvatinib are the only FDA-approved first-line treatments for advanced HCC. One of the major drawbacks in the preclinical drug development is the lack of suitable model systems. In recent years, 3D organoid cultures were established from several organs and tumour subtypes, thereby opening new avenues in tumour research. 3D organoid cultures are used to describe the tumour diversity, for cancer modelling in a dish and for therapy responsiveness. The establishment of living biobanks and the development of next-generation matrices are promising approaches to overcome drug resistance and to improve the quality of personalised anticancer strategies for patients with PLC. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of 3D cultures generated from healthy liver and primary liver cancer.	
31594944        	5-Fluorouracil treatment induces characteristic T>G mutations in human cancer.            	5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic drug commonly used for the treatment of solid cancers. It is proposed that 5-FU interferes with nucleotide synthesis and incorporates into DNA, which may have a mutational impact on both surviving tumor and healthy cells. Here, we treat intestinal organoids with 5-FU and find a highly characteristic mutational pattern that is dominated by T>G substitutions in a CTT context. Tumor whole genome sequencing data confirms that this signature is also identified in vivo in colorectal and breast cancer patients who have received 5-FU treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 5-FU is mutagenic and may drive tumor evolution and increase the risk of secondary malignancies. Furthermore, the identified signature shows a strong resemblance to COSMIC signature 17, the hallmark signature of treatment-naive esophageal and gastric tumors, which indicates that distinct endogenous and exogenous triggers can converge onto highly similar mutational signatures.	
32222998        	Regional Differences in Human Biliary Tissues and Corresponding In Vitro-Derived Organoids.            	Organoids provide a powerful system to study epithelia in vitro. Recently, this approach was applied successfully to the biliary tree, a series of ductular tissues responsible for the drainage of bile and pancreatic secretions. More precisely, organoids have been derived from ductal tissue located outside (extrahepatic bile ducts; EHBDs) or inside the liver (intrahepatic bile ducts; IHBDs). These organoids share many characteristics, including expression of cholangiocyte markers such as keratin (KRT) 19. However, the relationship between these organoids and their tissues of origin, and to each other, is largely unknown.                Organoids were derived from human gallbladder, common bile duct, pancreatic duct, and IHBDs using culture conditions promoting WNT signaling. The resulting IHBD and EHBD organoids expressed stem/progenitor markers leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5/prominin 1 and ductal markers KRT19/KRT7. However, RNA sequencing revealed that organoids conserve only a limited number of regional-specific markers corresponding to their location of origin. Of particular interest, down-regulation of biliary markers and up-regulation of cell-cycle genes were observed in organoids. IHBD and EHBD organoids diverged in their response to WNT signaling, and only IHBDs were able to express a low level of hepatocyte markers under differentiation conditions.                Taken together, our results demonstrate that differences exist not only between extrahepatic biliary organoids and their tissue of origin, but also between IHBD and EHBD organoids. This information may help to understand the tissue specificity of cholangiopathies and also to identify targets for therapeutic development.                © 2020 The Authors.

32322056        	Paracrine orchestration of intestinal tumorigenesis by a mesenchymal niche.            	The initiation of an intestinal tumour is a probabilistic process that depends on the competition between mutant and normal epithelial stem cells in crypts1. Intestinal stem cells are closely associated with a diverse but poorly characterized network of mesenchymal cell types2,3. However, whether the physiological mesenchymal microenvironment of mutant stem cells affects tumour initiation remains unknown. Here we provide in vivo evidence that the mesenchymal niche controls tumour initiation in trans. By characterizing the heterogeneity of the intestinal mesenchyme using single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, we identified a population of rare pericryptal Ptgs2-expressing fibroblasts that constitutively process arachidonic acid into highly labile prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Specific ablation of Ptgs2 in fibroblasts was sufficient to prevent tumour initiation in two different models of sporadic, autochthonous tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses of a mesenchymal niche model showed that fibroblast-derived PGE2 drives the expansion οf a population of Sca-1+ reserve-like stem cells. These express a strong regenerative/tumorigenic program, driven by the Hippo pathway effector Yap. In vivo, Yap is indispensable for Sca-1+ cell expansion and early tumour initiation and displays a nuclear localization in both mouse and human adenomas. Using organoid experiments, we identified a molecular mechanism whereby PGE2 promotes Yap dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity by signalling through the receptor Ptger4. Epithelial-specific ablation of Ptger4 misdirected the regenerative reprogramming of stem cells and prevented Sca-1+ cell expansion and sporadic tumour initiation in mutant mice, thereby demonstrating the robust paracrine control of tumour-initiating stem cells by PGE2-Ptger4. Analyses of patient-derived organoids established that PGE2-PTGER4 also regulates stem-cell function in humans. Our study demonstrates that initiation of colorectal cancer is orchestrated by the mesenchymal niche and reveals a mechanism by which rare pericryptal Ptgs2-expressing fibroblasts exert paracrine control over tumour-initiating stem cells via the druggable PGE2-Ptger4-Yap signalling axis.

We previously established long-term culture conditions under which single crypts or stem cells derived from mouse small intestine expand over long periods. The expanding crypts undergo multiple crypt fission events, simultaneously generating villus-like epithelial domains that contain all differentiated types of cells. We have adapted the culture conditions to grow similar epithelial organoids from mouse colon and human small intestine and colon.                Based on the mouse small intestinal culture system, we optimized the mouse and human colon culture systems.                Addition of Wnt3A to the combination of growth factors applied to mouse colon crypts allowed them to expand indefinitely. Addition of nicotinamide, along with a small molecule inhibitor of Alk and an inhibitor of p38, were required for long-term culture of human small intestine and colon tissues. The culture system also allowed growth of mouse Apc-deficient adenomas, human colorectal cancer cells, and human metaplastic epithelia from regions of Barrett's esophagus.                We developed a technology that can be used to study infected, inflammatory, or neoplastic tissues from the human gastrointestinal tract. These tools might have applications in regenerative biology through ex vivo expansion of the intestinal epithelia. Studies of these cultures indicate that there is no inherent restriction in the replicative potential of adult stem cells (or a Hayflick limit) ex vivo.                Copyright © 2011 AGA Institute.

32222043        	Deficiency in IκBα in the intestinal epithelium leads to spontaneous inflammation and mediates apoptosis in the gut.            	The IκB kinase (IKK)-NF-κB signaling pathway plays a multifaceted role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): on the one hand, it protects from apoptosis; on the other, it activates transcription of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Although several murine models of IBD rely on disruption of IKK-NF-κB signaling, these involve either knockouts of a single family member of NF-κB or of upstream kinases that are known to have additional, NF-κB-independent, functions. This has made the distinct contribution of NF-κB to homeostasis in intestinal epithelium cells difficult to assess. To examine the role of constitutive NF-κB activation in intestinal epithelial cells, we generated a mouse model with a tissue-specific knockout of the direct inhibitor of NF-κB, Nfkbia/IκBα. We demonstrate that constitutive activation of NF-κB in intestinal epithelial cells induces several hallmarks of IBD including increased apoptosis, mucosal inflammation in both the small intestine and the colon, crypt hyperplasia, and depletion of Paneth cells, concomitant with aberrant Wnt signaling. To determine which NF-κB-driven phenotypes are cell-intrinsic, and which are extrinsic and thus require the immune compartment, we established a long-term organoid culture. Constitutive NF-κB promoted stem-cell proliferation, mis-localization of Paneth cells, and sensitization of intestinal epithelial cells to apoptosis in a cell-intrinsic manner. Increased number of stem cells was accompanied by a net increase in Wnt activity in organoids. Because aberrant Wnt signaling is associated with increased risk of cancer in IBD patients and because NFKBIA has recently emerged as a risk locus for IBD, our findings have critical implications for the clinic. In a context of constitutive NF-κB, our findings imply that general anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapies should be supplemented with direct targeting of NF-κB within the epithelial compartment in order to attenuate apoptosis, inflammation, and hyperproliferation. © 2020 The Authors.

32867142        	Organoids in Translational Oncology.            	Translational medicine aims to translate the most promising preclinical research into clinical practice. Oncology is a continuously growing medical field: the scientific research on cancer biology is currently based on in vitro experiments, carried out on tissue culture plates (TCPs) and other 2D samples. In this context, 3D printing has greatly improved the biofabrication of new biological matrices that mimic the extracellular environments, which may characterize healthy from cancerous tissues. Organoids have recently been described in several reports on scientific literature. The term that better describes such organoids-based tumoral tissues is "tumoroids". Tumoroids are substantially "tumor-like organoids", typically deriving from primary tumors harvested from patients. This topical review aims to give an update on organoids applied in translational medicine, paying specific attention to their use in the investigation of the main molecular mechanisms of cancer onset and growth, and on the most impacting strategies for effective targeted therapies.	
30260411        	Cell Model Passports-a hub for clinical, genetic and functional datasets of preclinical cancer models.            	In vitro cancer cell cultures are facile experimental models used widely for research and drug development. Many cancer cell lines are available and efforts are ongoing to derive new models representing the histopathological and molecular diversity of tumours. Cell models have been generated by multiple laboratories over decades and consequently their annotation is incomplete and inconsistent. Furthermore, the relationships between many patient-matched and derivative cell lines have been lost, and accessing information and datasets is time-consuming and difficult. Here, we describe the Cell Model Passports database; cellmodelpassports.sanger.ac.uk, which provides details of cell model relationships, patient and clinical information, as well as access to associated genetic and functional datasets. The Passports database currently contains curated details and standardized annotation for >1200 cell models, including cancer organoid cultures. The Passports will be updated with newly derived cell models and datasets as they are generated. Users can navigate the database via tissue, cancer-type, genetic feature and data availability to select a model most suitable for specific applications. A flexible REST-API provides programmatic data access and exploration. The Cell Model Passports are a valuable tool enabling access to high-dimensional genomic and phenotypic cancer cell model datasets empowering diverse research applications.	
33483567        	Re-expression of REG family and DUOXs genes in CRC organoids by co-culturing with CAFs.            	Organoids derived from epithelial tumors have recently been utilized as a preclinical model in basic and translational studies. This model is considered to represent the original tumor in terms of 3D structure, genetic and cellular heterogeneity, but not tumor microenvironment. In this study, we established organoids and paired cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from surgical specimens of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs), and evaluated gene expression profiles in organoids with and without co-culture with CAFs to assess interactions between tumor cells and CAFs in tumor tissues. We found that the expression levels of several genes, which are highly expressed in original CRC tissues, were downregulated in organoids but re-expressed in organoids by co-culturing with CAFs. They comprised immune response- and external stimulus-related genes, e.g., REG family and dual oxidases (DUOXs), which are known to have malignant functions, leading tumor cells to proliferative and/or anti-apoptotic states and drug resistant phenotypes. In addition, the degree of differential induction of REG1 and DUOX2 in the co-culture system varied depending on CAFs from each CRC case. In conclusion, the co-culture system of CRC organoids with paired CAFs was able to partially reproduce the tumor microenvironment.	
33244783        	Similarities and differences in metabolites of tongue cancer cells among two- and three-dimensional cultures and xenografts.            	Metabolic programming of cancer cells is an essential step in transformation and tumor growth. We established two-dimensional (2D) monolayer and three-dimensional (3D) cultures, the latter called a "tissueoid cell culture system", using four types of tongue cancer cell lines. We also undertook a comprehensive metabolome analysis of three groups that included xenografts created by transplanting the cell lines into nude mice. In addition, we undertook a functional analysis of the mitochondria, which plays a key role in cancer metabolism. Principal component analysis revealed the plots of the four cell lines to be much narrower in 2D culture than in 3D culture and xenograft groups. Moreover, compared to xenografts, the 2D culture had significantly lower levels of most metabolites. These results suggest that the unique characteristics of each cell disappeared in 2D culture, and a type of metabolism unique to monolayer culture took over. Conversely, ATP production, biomass synthesis, and maintenance of redox balance were shown in 3D culture using sufficient nutrients, which closely resembled the metabolic activity in the xenografts. However, there were several differences between the metabolic activity in the 3D culture and xenografts. In vivo, the cancer tissue had blood flow with stromal cells present around the cancer cells. In the xenografts, we detected metabolized and degraded products in the liver and other organs of the host mice. Furthermore, the 3D system did not show impairment of mitochondrial function in the cancer cells, suggesting that cancer cells produce energy simultaneously through mitochondria, as well as aerobic glycolysis.                © 2020 The Authors.

29679778        	Recapitulating spatiotemporal tumor heterogeneity in vitro through engineered breast cancer microtissues.            	Tumor and microenvironmental heterogeneity hinders the study of breast cancer biology and the assessment of therapeutic strategies, being associated with high variability and drug resistance. In this context, it is mandatory to develop three-dimensional breast tumor models able to reproduce this heterogeneity and the dynamic interaction occurring between tumor cells and microenvironment. Here we show a new breast cancer microtissue model (T-µTP) uniquely able to present intra-tumor morphological heterogeneity in a dynamic and responsive endogenous matrix. T-µTP consists of adenocarcinoma cells, endothelial cells and stromal fibroblasts. These three kinds of cells are totally embedded into an endogenous matrix which is rich in collagen and hyaluronic acid and it is directly produced by human fibroblasts. In this highly physiologically relevant environment, tumor cells evolve in different cluster morphologies recapitulating tumor spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Moreover they activate the desmoplastic and vascular reaction with affected collagen content, assembly and organization and the presence of aberrant capillary-like structures (CLS). Thus, T-µTP allows to outline main crucial events involved in breast cancer progression into a single model overcoming the limit of artificial extra cellular matrix surrogates. We strongly believe that T-µTP is a suitable model for the study of breast cancer and for drug screening assays following key parameters of clinical interest.                Tumor and microenvironmental heterogeneity makes very hurdle to find a way to study and treat breast cancer. Here we develop an innovative 3D tumor microtissue model recapitulating in vitro tumor heterogeneity. Tumor microtissues are characterized by the activation of the stromal and vascular reaction too. We underline the importance to mimic different microenvironmental tumor features in the same time and in a single tissue in order to obtain a model of spatiotemporal tumor genesis and progression, suitable for the study of tumor treatment and resistance.

33245115        	Patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells transfer mitochondria through tunneling nanotubes in tumor organoids.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain cancer and its relapse after surgery, chemo and radiotherapy appears to be led by GBM stem cells (GSCs). Also, tumor networking and intercellular communication play a major role in driving GBM therapy-resistance. Tunneling Nanotubes (TNTs), thin membranous open-ended channels connecting distant cells, have been observed in several types of cancer, where they emerge to drive a more malignant phenotype. Here, we investigated whether GBM cells are capable to intercommunicate by TNTs. Two GBM stem-like cells (GSLCs) were obtained from the external and infiltrative zone of one GBM from one patient. We show, for the first time, that both GSLCs, grown in classical 2D culture and in 3D-tumor organoids, formed functional TNTs which allowed mitochondria transfer. In the organoid model, recapitulative of several tumor's features, we observed the formation of a network between cells constituted of both Tumor Microtubes (TMs), previously observed in vivo, and TNTs. In addition, the two GSLCs exhibited different responses to irradiation in terms of TNT induction and mitochondria transfer, although the correlation with the disease progression and therapy-resistance needs to be further addressed. Thus, TNT-based communication is active in different GSLCs derived from the external tumoral areas associated to GBM relapse, and we propose that they participate together with TMs in tumor networking.                © 2021 The Author(s).	
31288376        	β-Catenin/TCF4 Complex-Mediated Induction of the NRF3 (NFE2L3) Gene in Cancer Cells.            	Remarkable upregulation of the NRF2 (NFE2L2)-related transcription factor NRF3 (NFE2L3) in several cancer tissues and its correlation with poor prognosis strongly suggest the physiological function of NRF3 in tumors. Indeed, we had recently uncovered the function of NRF3, which promotes cancer cell proliferation by p53 degradation via the 20S proteasome. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism underlying the induction of NRF3 gene expression in cancer cells is highly elusive. We herein describe that NRF3 upregulation is induced by the β-catenin/TCF4 complex in colon cancer cells. We first confirmed high NRF3 mRNA expression in human colon cancer specimens. The genome database indicated that the human NRF3 gene possesses a species-conserved WRE sequence (TCF/LEF consensus element), implying that the β-catenin/TCF complex activates NRF3 expression in colon cancer. Consistently, we observed that the β-catenin/TCF4 complex mediates NRF3 expression by binding directly to the WRE site. Furthermore, inducing NRF3 activates cell proliferation and the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1. The existence of the β-catenin/TCF4-NRF3 axis was also validated in the intestine and organoids of Apc-deficient mice. Finally, the positive correlation between NRF3 and β-catenin target gene expression strongly supports our conclusion. Our findings clearly demonstrate that NRF3 induction in cancer cells is controlled by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.	
30117261        	A patient-derived explant (PDE) model of hormone-dependent cancer.            	Breast and prostate cancer research to date has largely been predicated on the use of cell lines in vitro or in vivo. These limitations have led to the development of more clinically relevant models, such as organoids or murine xenografts that utilize patient-derived material; however, issues related to low take rate, long duration of establishment, and the associated costs constrain use of these models. This study demonstrates that ex vivo culture of freshly resected breast and prostate tumor specimens obtained from surgery, termed patient-derived explants (PDEs), provides a high-throughput and cost-effective model that retains the native tissue architecture, microenvironment, cell viability, and key oncogenic drivers. The PDE model provides a unique approach for direct evaluation of drug responses on an individual patient's tumor, which is amenable to analysis using contemporary genomic technologies. The ability to rapidly evaluate drug efficacy in patient-derived material has high potential to facilitate implementation of personalized medicine approaches.                © 2018 The Authors.

31772167        	Both fallopian tube and ovarian surface epithelium are cells-of-origin for high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.            	The cell-of-origin of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remains controversial, with fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) both considered candidates. Here, by using genetically engineered mouse models and organoids, we assessed the tumor-forming properties of FTE and OSE harboring the same oncogenic abnormalities. Combined RB family inactivation and Tp53 mutation in Pax8 + FTE caused Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma (STIC), which metastasized rapidly to the ovarian surface. These events were recapitulated by orthotopic injection of mutant FTE organoids. Engineering the same genetic lesions into Lgr5 + OSE or OSE-derived organoids also caused metastatic HGSOC, although with longer latency and lower penetrance. FTE- and OSE-derived tumors had distinct transcriptomes, and comparative transcriptomics and genomics suggest that human HGSOC arises from both cell types. Finally, FTE- and OSE-derived organoids exhibited differential chemosensitivity. Our results comport with a dualistic origin for HGSOC and suggest that the cell-of-origin might influence therapeutic response.	
33652561        	Preclinical Evaluation of Artesunate as an Antineoplastic Agent in Ovarian Cancer Treatment.            	Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy despite current first-line treatment with a platinum and taxane doublet. Artesunate has broad antineoplastic properties but has not been investigated in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for ovarian cancer treatment.                Standard cell culture technique with commercially available ovarian cancer cell lines were utilized in cell viability, DNA damage, and cell cycle progression assays to qualify and quantify artesunate treatment effects. Additionally, the sequence of administering artesunate in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin was determined. The activity of artesunate was also assessed in 3D organoid models of primary ovarian cancer and RNAseq analysis was utilized to identify genes and the associated genetic pathways that were differentially regulated in artesunate resistant organoid models compared to organoids that were sensitive to artesunate.                Artesunate treatment reduces cell viability in 2D and 3D ovarian cancer cell models. Clinically relevant concentrations of artesunate induce G1 arrest, but do not induce DNA damage. Pathways related to cell cycle progression, specifically G1/S transition, are upregulated in ovarian organoid models that are innately more resistant to artesunate compared to more sensitive models. Depending on the sequence of administration, the addition of artesunate to carboplatin and paclitaxel improves their effectiveness.                Artesunate has preclinical activity in ovarian cancer that merits further investigation to treat ovarian cancer.	
27941077        	Posttranslational modification of β-catenin is associated with pathogenic fibroblastic changes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.            	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of premature birth. The histopathology of BPD is characterized by an arrest of alveolarization with fibroblast activation. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is important in early lung development. When Wnt signaling is active, phosphorylation of β-catenin by tyrosine kinases at activating sites, specifically at tyrosine 489 (Y489), correlates with nuclear localization of β-catenin. We examined fetal lung tissue, lung tissue from term newborns, and lung tissue from infants who died with BPD; we found nuclear β-catenin phosphorylation at Y489 in epithelial and mesenchymal cells in fetal tissue and BPD tissue, but not in the lungs of term infants. Using a 3D human organoid model, we found increased nuclear localization of β-catenin phosphorylated at Y489 (p-β-cateninY489) after exposure to alternating hypoxia and hyperoxia compared with organoids cultured in normoxia. Exogenous stimulation of the canonical Wnt pathway in organoids was sufficient to cause nuclear localization of p-β-cateninY489 in normoxia and mimicked the pattern of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression seen with fibroblastic activation from oxidative stress. Treatment of organoids with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor prior to cyclic hypoxia-hyperoxia inhibited nuclear localization of p-β-cateninY489 and prevented α-SMA expression by fibroblasts. Posttranslational phosphorylation of β-catenin is a transient feature of normal lung development. Moreover, the persistence of p-β-cateninY489 is a durable marker of fibroblast activation in BPD and may play an important role in BPD disease pathobiology.

31069322        	Review: Synthetic scaffolds to control the biochemical, mechanical, and geometrical environment of stem cell-derived brain organoids.            	Stem cell-derived brain organoids provide a powerful platform for systematic studies of tissue functional architecture and the development of personalized therapies. Here, we review key advances at the interface of soft matter and stem cell biology on synthetic alternatives to extracellular matrices. We emphasize recent biomaterial-based strategies that have been proven advantageous towards optimizing organoid growth and controlling the geometrical, biomechanical, and biochemical properties of the organoid's three-dimensional environment. We highlight systems that have the potential to increase the translational value of region-specific brain organoid models suitable for different types of manipulations and high-throughput applications.	
31319796        	HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis: the role of signalling pathways and innovative ex vivo research models.            	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of liver cancer, but the mechanisms by which HBV causes liver cancer are poorly understood and chemotherapeutic strategies to cure liver cancer are not available. A better understanding of how HBV requisitions cellular components in the liver will identify novel therapeutic targets for HBV associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).                The development of HCC involves deregulation in several cellular signalling pathways including Wnt/FZD/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, IRS1/IGF, and Ras/Raf/MAPK. HBV is known to dysregulate several hepatocyte pathways and cell cycle regulation resulting in HCC development. A number of these HBV induced changes are also mediated through the Wnt/FZD/β-catenin pathway. The lack of a suitable human liver model for the study of HBV has hampered research into understanding pathogenesis of HBV. Primary human hepatocytes provide one option; however, these cells are prone to losing their hepatic functionality and their ability to support HBV replication. Another approach involves induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived hepatocytes. However, iPS technology relies on retroviruses or lentiviruses for effective gene delivery and pose the risk of activating a range of oncogenes. Liver organoids developed from patient-derived liver tissues provide a significant advance in HCC research. Liver organoids retain the characteristics of their original tissue, undergo unlimited expansion, can be differentiated into mature hepatocytes and are susceptible to natural infection with HBV.                By utilizing new ex vivo techniques like liver organoids it will become possible to develop improved and personalized therapeutic approaches that will improve HCC outcomes and potentially lead to a cure for HBV.	
32864586        	Translating Embryogenesis to Generate Organoids: Novel Approaches to Personalized Medicine.            	The astounding capacity of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to differentiate and self-organize has revolutionized the development of 3D cell culture models. The major advantage is its ability to mimic in vivo microenvironments and cellular interactions when compared with the classical 2D cell culture models. Recent innovations in generating embryo-like structures (including blastoids and gastruloids) from PSCs have advanced the experimental accessibility to understand embryogenesis with immense potential to model human development. Taking cues on how embryonic development leads to organogenesis, PSCs can also be directly differentiated to form mini-organs or organoids of a particular lineage. Organoids have opened new avenues to augment our understanding of stem cell and regenerative biology, tissue homeostasis, and disease mechanisms. In this review, we provide insights from developmental biology with a comprehensive resource of signaling pathways that in a coordinated manner form embryo-like structures and organoids. Moreover, the advent of assembloids and multilineage organoids from PSCs opens a new dimension to study paracrine function and multi-tissue interactions in vitro. Although this led to an avalanche of enthusiasm to utilize organoids for organ transplantation studies, we examine the current limitations and provide perspectives to improve reproducibility, scalability, functional complexity, and cell-type characterization. Taken together, these 3D in vitro organ-specific and patient-specific models hold great promise for drug discovery, clinical management, and personalized medicine.

33596248        	Ephrin receptor A2, the epithelial receptor for Epstein-Barr virus entry, is not available for efficient infection in human gastric organoids.            	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is best known for infection of B cells, in which it usually establishes an asymptomatic lifelong infection, but is also associated with the development of multiple B cell lymphomas. EBV also infects epithelial cells and is associated with all cases of undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). EBV is etiologically linked with at least 8% of gastric cancer (EBVaGC) that comprises a genetically and epigenetically distinct subset of GC. Although we have a very good understanding of B cell entry and lymphomagenesis, the sequence of events leading to EBVaGC remains poorly understood. Recently, ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2) was proposed as the epithelial cell receptor on human cancer cell lines. Although we confirm some of these results, we demonstrate that EBV does not infect healthy adult stem cell-derived gastric organoids. In matched pairs of normal and cancer-derived organoids from the same patient, EBV only reproducibly infected the cancer organoids. While there was no clear pattern of differential expression between normal and cancer organoids for EPHA2 at the RNA and protein level, the subcellular location of the protein differed markedly. Confocal microscopy showed EPHA2 localization at the cell-cell junctions in primary cells, but not in cancer cell lines. Furthermore, histologic analysis of patient tissue revealed the absence of EBV in healthy epithelium and presence of EBV in epithelial cells from inflamed tissue. These data suggest that the EPHA2 receptor is not accessible to EBV on healthy gastric epithelial cells with intact cell-cell contacts, but either this or another, yet to be identified receptor may become accessible following cellular changes induced by inflammation or transformation, rendering changes in the cellular architecture an essential prerequisite to EBV infection.	
31097715        	Combination of 5-fluorouracil and thymoquinone targets stem cell gene signature in colorectal cancer cells.            	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) residing in colorectal cancer tissues have tumorigenic capacity and contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance and disease relapse. It is well known that the survival of colorectal CSCs after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based therapy leads to cancer recurrence. Thus CSCs represent a promising drug target. Here, we designed and synthesized novel hybrid molecules linking 5-FU with the plant-derived compound thymoquinone (TQ) and tested the potential of individual compounds and their combination to eliminate colorectal CSCs. Both, Combi and SARB hybrid showed augmented cytotoxicity against colorectal cancer cells, but were non-toxic to organoids prepared from healthy murine small intestine. NanoString analysis revealed a unique signature of deregulated gene expression in response to the combination of TQ and 5-FU (Combi) and SARB treatment. Importantly, two principle stem cell regulatory pathways WNT/ß-Catenin and PI3K/AKT were found to be downregulated after Combi and hybrid treatment. Furthermore, both treatments strikingly eliminated CD133+ CSC population, accompanying the depleted self-renewal capacity by eradicating long-term propagated 3D tumor cell spheres at sub-toxic doses. In vivo xenografts on chicken eggs of SARB-treated HCT116 cells showed a prominent nuclear ß-Catenin and E-cadherin staining. This was in line with the reduced transcriptional activity of ß-Catenin and diminished cell adhesion under SARB exposure. In contrast to 5-FU, both, Combi and SARB treatment effectively reduced the angiogenic capacity of the remaining resistant tumor cells. Taken together, combination or hybridization of single compounds target simultaneously a broader spectrum of oncogenic pathways leading to an effective eradication of colorectal cancer cells.	
25924068        	Sequential cancer mutations in cultured human intestinal stem cells.            	Crypt stem cells represent the cells of origin for intestinal neoplasia. Both mouse and human intestinal stem cells can be cultured in medium containing the stem-cell-niche factors WNT, R-spondin, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and noggin over long time periods as epithelial organoids that remain genetically and phenotypically stable. Here we utilize CRISPR/Cas9 technology for targeted gene modification of four of the most commonly mutated colorectal cancer genes (APC, P53 (also known as TP53), KRAS and SMAD4) in cultured human intestinal stem cells. Mutant organoids can be selected by removing individual growth factors from the culture medium. Quadruple mutants grow independently of all stem-cell-niche factors and tolerate the presence of the P53 stabilizer nutlin-3. Upon xenotransplantation into mice, quadruple mutants grow as tumours with features of invasive carcinoma. Finally, combined loss of APC and P53 is sufficient for the appearance of extensive aneuploidy, a hallmark of tumour progression.	
29303193        	Nanoparticle binding attenuates the pathobiology of gastric cancer-associated Helicobacter pylori.            	Enteric bacteria may cause severe diseases, including gastric cancer-associated Helicobacter pylori. Their infection paths overlap with the oro-gastrointestinal uptake route for nanoparticles, increasingly occurring during environmental or consumer/medical exposure. By comprehensive independent analytical methods, such as live cell fluorescence, electron as well as atomic force microscopy and elemental analysis, we show that a wide array of nanoparticles (NPs) but not microparticles form complexes with H. pylori and enteric pathogens without the need for specific functionalization. The NP-assembly that occurred rapidly was not influenced by variations in physiological temperature, though affected by the NPs' physico-chemical characteristics. Improved binding was observed for small NPs with a negative surface charge, whereas binding could be reduced by surface 'stealth' modifications. Employing human gastric epithelial cells and 3D-organoid models of the stomach, we show that NP-coating did not inhibit H. pylori's cellular attachment. However, even the assembly of non-bactericidal silica NPs attenuated H. pylori infection by reducing CagA phosphorylation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and IL-8 secretion. Here we demonstrate that NP binding to enteric bacteria may impact their pathobiology which could be further exploited to rationally modulate the (patho)biology of microbes by nanomaterials.	
29103082        	miR-324-3p promotes gastric cancer development by activating Smad4-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.            	Emerging evidence suggested that miRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors by regulating downstream target genes. miR-324-3p has been reported to function in several carcinomas, but its role in gastric cancer (GC) is still unknown. This study aims to explore the effects of miR-324-3p on the development of GC.                Expression of miR-324-3p was examined in GC cells and tissues by qRT-PCR. Effects of miR-324-3p on GC cells were evaluated by cell vitality assay, colony formation assay, cell migration assay, and flow cytometric assay. The dual luciferase assay was used to verify whether miR-324-3p could interact with the potential target genes. Western blot was used to assess the expression level of Smad4 and beta-catenin. Intracellular ATP level was also examined. The tumor xenografts were established using nude mice. A gastric organoid model was made from fresh stomach tissue.                miR-324-3p was expressed at higher levels in the tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of miR-324-3p promoted cell growth, migration, and decreased apoptosis. miR-324-3p repressed the expression of Smad4, and loss of Smad4 activated the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of Smad4 rescued the effects of miR-324-3p on GC cells. The intracellular ATP level was upregulated with overexpression of miR-324-3p. miR-324-3p facilitated tumor cell colonization and growth in vivo and contributed to the growth of gastric organoids.                The results suggested that miR-324-3p promoted GC through activating the Smad4-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The miR-324-3p/Smad4/Wnt signaling axis may be a potential therapeutic target to prevent GC progression.	
30703170        	Increased Programmed Death-Ligand 1 is an Early Epithelial Cell Response to Helicobacter pylori Infection.            	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Our laboratory has reported that the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is an early response to infection that is fundamental to the initiation of H. pylori-induced gastritis. H. pylori also induces programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on gastric epithelial cells, yet the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesize that H. pylori-induced PD-L1 expression within the gastric epithelium is mediated by the Shh signaling pathway during infection. To identify the role of Shh signaling as a mediator of H. pylori-induced PD-L1 expression, human gastric organoids generated from either induced pluripotent stem cells (HGOs) or tissue (huFGOs) were microinjected with bacteria and treated with Hedgehog/Gli inhibitor GANT61. Gastric epithelial monolayers generated from the huFGOs were also infected with H. pylori and treated with GANT61 to study the role of Hedgehog signaling as a mediator of induced PD-1 expression. A patient-derived organoid/autologous immune cell co-culture system infected with H. pylori and treated with PD-1 inhibitor (PD-1Inh) was developed to study the protective mechanism of PD-L1 in response to bacterial infection. H. pylori significantly increased PD-L1 expression in organoid cultures 48 hours post-infection when compared to uninfected controls. The mechanism was cytotoxic associated gene A (CagA) dependent. This response was blocked by pretreatment with GANT61. Anti-PD-L1 treatment of H. pylori infected huFGOs, co-cultured with autologous patient cytotoxic T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, induced organoid death. H. pylori-induced PD-L1 expression is mediated by the Shh signaling pathway within the gastric epithelium. Cells infected with H. pylori that express PD-L1 may be protected from the immune response, creating premalignant lesions progressing to gastric cancer.	
24062584        	Cell and tissue polarity in the intestinal tract during tumourigenesis: cells still know the right way up, but tissue organization is lost.            	Cell and tissue polarity are tightly coupled and are vital for normal tissue homeostasis. Changes in cellular and tissue organization are common to even early stages of disease, particularly cancer. The digestive tract is the site of the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the developed world. Tumours in this tissue arise in an epithelium that has a number of axes of cell and tissue polarity. Changes in cell and tissue polarity in response to genetic changes that are known to underpin disease progression provide clues about the link between molecular-, cellular- and tissue-based mechanisms that accompany cancer. Mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) are common to most colorectal cancers in humans and are sufficient to cause tumours in mouse intestine. Tissue organoids mimic many features of whole tissue and permit identifying changes at different times after inactivation of APC. Using gut organoids, we show that tissue polarity is lost very early during cancer progression, whereas cell polarity, at least apical-basal polarity, is maintained and changes only at later stages. These observations reflect the situation in tumours and validate tissue organoids as a useful system to investigate the relationship between cell polarity and tissue organization.	
32068138        	Probing prodrug metabolism and reciprocal toxicity with an integrated and humanized multi-tissue organ-on-a-chip platform.            	Current drug development techniques are expensive and inefficient, partially due to the use of preclinical models that do not accurately recapitulate in vivo drug efficacy and cytotoxicity. To address this challenge, we report on an integrated, in vitro multi-organoid system that enables parallel assessment of drug efficiency and toxicity on multiple 3D tissue organoids. Built in a low-cost, adhesive film-based microfluidic device, these miniaturized structures require less than 200 µL fluid volume and are amenable to both matrix-based 3D cell culture and spheroid aggregate integration, each supported with an in situ photocrosslinkable hyaluronic acid hydrogel. Here, we demonstrate this technology first with a three-organoid device consisting of liver, cardiac, and lung constructs. We show that these multiple tissue types can be kept in common circulation with high viability for 21 days and validate the platform by investigating liver metabolism of the prodrug capecitabine into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and observing downstream toxicity in lung and cardiac organoids. Then we expand the integrated system to accommodate six humanized constructs, including liver, cardiac, lung, endothelium, brain, and testes organoids. Following a 14-day incubation in common media, we demonstrate multi-tissue interactions by metabolizing the alkylating prodrug ifosfamide in the liver organoid to produce chloroacetaldehyde and induce downstream neurotoxicity. Our results establish an expandable, multi-organoid body-on-a-chip system that can be fabricated easily and used for the accurate characterization of drug interactions in vitro. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The use of 3-dimensional (3D) in vitro models in drug development has advanced over the past decade. However, with several exceptions, the majority of research studies using 3D in vitro models, such as organoids, employ single tissue types, in isolated environments with no "communication" between different tissues. This is a significant limiting factor because in the human body there is significant signaling between different cells, tissues, and organs. Here we employ a low-cost, adhesive film-based microfluidic device approach, paired with a versatile extracellular matrix-derived hyaluronic acid hydrogel to support integrated systems of 3 and 6 3D organoid and cell constructs. Moreover, we demonstrate an integrated response to drugs, in which downstream toxicity is dependent on the presence of liver organoids.                Copyright © 2020 Acta Materialia Inc.

27446646        	Changes in autofluorescence based organoid model of muscle invasive urinary bladder cancer.            	Muscle invasive urinary bladder cancer is one of the most lethal cancers and its detection at the time of transurethral resection remains limited and diagnostic methods are urgently needed. We have developed a muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) model of the bladder using porcine bladder scaffold and the human bladder cancer cell line 5637. The progression of implanted cancer cells to muscle invasion can be monitored by measuring changes in the spectrum of endogenous fluorophores such as reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide (NADH) and flavins. We believe this could act as a useful tool for the study of fluorescence dynamics of developing muscle invasive bladder cancer in patients.

30365932        	TRIB3 Interacts With β-Catenin and TCF4 to Increase Stem Cell Features of Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells and Tumorigenesis.            	Activation of Wnt signaling to β-catenin contributes to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Expression of tribbles pseudo-kinase 3 (TRIB3) is increased in some colorectal tumors and associated with poor outcome. We investigated whether increased TRIB3 expression promotes stem cell features of CRC cells and tumor progression by interacting with the Wnt signaling pathway.                We performed studies with C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J mice injected with an adeno-associated virus vector that expresses a small hairpin RNA against Trib3 mRNA (ApcMin/J-Trib3KD) or a control vector (ApcMin/J-Ctrl). We created BALB/c mice that overexpress TRIB3 from an adeno-associated virus vector and mice with small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of β-catenin. The mice were given azoxymethane followed by dextran sodium sulfate to induce colitis-associated cancer. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by histology, gene expression profiling, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5)-positive (LGR5Pos) and LGR5-negative (LGR5Neg) HCT-8 CRC cells, with or without knockdown or transgenic expression of TRIB3, were sorted and analyzed in sphere-formation assays. We derived organoids from human and mouse colorectal tumors to analyze the function of TRIB3 and test the effect of a peptide inhibitor. Wnt signaling to β-catenin was analyzed in dual luciferase reporter, chromatin precipitation, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot assays. Proteins that interact with TRIB3 were identified by immunoprecipitation. CRC cell lines were grown in nude mice as xenograft tumors.                At 10 weeks of age, more than half the ApcMin/J-Ctrl mice developed intestinal high-grade epithelial neoplasia, whereas ApcMin/J-Trib3KD mice had no intestinal polyps and normal histology. Colon tissues from ApcMin/J-Trib3KD mice expressed lower levels of genes regulated by β-catenin and genes associated with cancer stem cells. Mice with overexpression of Trib3 developed more tumors after administration of azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate than BALB/c mice. Mice with knockdown of β-catenin had a lower tumor burden after administration of azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate, regardless of Trib3 overexpression. Intestinal tissues from mice with overexpression of Trib3 and knockdown of β-catenin did not have activation of Wnt signaling or expression of genes regulated by β-catenin. LGR5Pos cells sorted from HCT-8 cells expressed higher levels of TRIB3 than LGR5Neg cells. CRC cells that overexpressed TRIB3 had higher levels of transcription by β-catenin and formed larger spheroids than control CRC cells; knockdown of β-catenin prevented the larger organoid size caused by TRIB3 overexpression. TRIB3 interacted physically with β-catenin and transcription factor 4 (TCF4). TRIB3 overexpression increased, and TRIB3 knockdown decreased, recruitment of TCF4 and β-catenin to the promoter region of genes regulated by Wnt. Activated β-catenin increased expression of TRIB3, indicating a positive-feedback loop. A peptide (P2-T3A6) that bound β-catenin disrupted its interaction with TRIB3 and TCF4. In primary CRC cells and HCT-8 cells, P2-T3A6 decreased expression of genes regulated by β-catenin and genes associated with cancer stem cells and decreased cell viability and migration. Injection of C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J mice with P2-T3A6 decreased the number and size of tumor nodules and colon expression of genes regulated by β-catenin. P2-T3A6 increased 5-fluorouracil-induced death of CRC cells and survival times of mice with xenograft tumors.                TRIB3 interacts with β-catenin and TCF4 in intestine cells to increase expression of genes associated with cancer stem cells. Knockdown of TRIB3 decreases colon neoplasia in mice, migration of CRC cells, and their growth as xenograft tumors in mice. Strategies to block TRIB3 activity might be developed for treatment of CRC.                Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
28275681        	Gastrointestinal Organoids: Understanding the Molecular Basis of the Host-Microbe Interface.            	In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to the concept that microorganisms play an integral role in human physiology and pathophysiology. Despite this, the molecular basis of host-pathogen and host-symbiont interactions in the human intestine remains poorly understood owing to the limited availability of human tissue, and the biological complexity of host-microbe interactions. Over the past decade, technological advances have enabled long-term culture of organotypic intestinal tissue derived from human subjects and from human pluripotent stem cells, and these in vitro culture systems already have shown the potential to inform our understanding significantly of host-microbe interactions. Gastrointestinal organoids represent a substantial advance in structural and functional complexity over traditional in vitro cell culture models of the human gastrointestinal epithelium while retaining much of the genetic and molecular tractability that makes in vitro experimentation so appealing. The opportunity to model epithelial barrier dynamics, cellular differentiation, and proliferation more accurately in specific intestinal segments and in tissue containing a proportional representation of the diverse epithelial subtypes found in the native gut greatly enhances the translational potential of organotypic gastrointestinal culture systems. By using these tools, researchers have uncovered novel aspects of host-pathogen and host-symbiont interactions with the intestinal epithelium. Application of these tools promises to reveal new insights into the pathogenesis of infectious disease, inflammation, cancer, and the role of microorganisms in intestinal development. This review summarizes research on the use of gastrointestinal organoids as a model of the host-microbe interface.	
30156908        	Stat3 is indispensable for damage-induced crypt regeneration but not for Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis.            	Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) has been shown to play a role in intestinal regeneration and colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis. However, the role of Stat3 in the Wnt-driven sporadic intestinal tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. We examined the roles of Stat3 in intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis by organoid culture experiments using Stat3∆IEC mouse-derived intestinal epithelial cells in which Stat3 was disrupted. The regeneration of intestinal mucosa and organoid formation were significantly suppressed by Stat3 disruption, which was compensated by Wnt activation. Furthermore, once organoids were recovered, Stat3 was no longer required for organoid growth. These results indicate that Stat3 and Wnt signaling cooperatively protect epithelial cells at the early phase of intestinal regeneration. In contrast, intestinal tumorigenesis was not suppressed by Stat3 disruption in adenomatous polyposis coli ( Apc) Δ716 and Apc∆716 Tgfbr2∆IEC mice, thus indicating that Stat3 is not required for Wnt activation-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, Itga5 and Itga6 were down-regulated by Stat3 disruption, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation was also suppressed. Notably, FAK inhibitor suppressed the organoid formation of wild-type epithelial cells. These results indicate that Stat3 is indispensable for the survival of epithelial cells through the activation of integrin signaling and the downstream FAK pathway; however, it is not required for the Wnt signaling-activated normal or tumor epithelial cells.-Oshima, H., Kok, S.-Y., Nakayama, M., Murakami, K., Voon, D. C.-C., Kimura, T., Oshima, M. Stat3 is indispensable for damage-induced crypt regeneration but not for Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis.	
30097486        	iRGD-guided Tumor-penetrating Nanocomplexes for Therapeutic siRNA Delivery to Pancreatic Cancer.            	Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death, with 5-year survival of 8.5%. The lack of significant progress in improving therapy reflects our inability to overcome the desmoplastic stromal barrier in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as well as a paucity of new approaches targeting its genetic underpinnings. RNA interference holds promise in targeting key mutations driving PDAC; however, a nucleic acid delivery vehicle that homes to PDAC and breaches the stroma does not yet exist. Noting that the cyclic peptide iRGD mediates tumor targeting and penetration through interactions with αvβ3/5 integrins and neuropilin-1, we hypothesized that "tandem" peptides combining a cell-penetrating peptide and iRGD can encapsulate siRNA to form tumor-penetrating nanocomplexes (TPN) capable of delivering siRNA to PDAC. The use of directly conjugated iRGD is justified by receptor expression patterns in human PDAC biopsies. In this work, we optimize iRGD TPNs with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-peptide conjugates for systemic delivery to sites of disease. We show that TPNs effectively knockdown siRNA targets in PDAC cell lines and in an immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC. Furthermore, we validate their tumor-penetrating ability in three-dimensional organoids and autochthonous tumors. In murine therapeutic trials, TPNs delivering anti-Kras siRNA significantly delay tumor growth. Thus, iRGD TPNs hold promise in treating PDAC by not only overcoming physical barriers to therapy, but by leveraging the stroma to achieve knockdown of the gold-standard genetic target. Moreover, the modular construction of this delivery platform allows for facile adaptation to future genetic target candidates in pancreatic cancer.

28932764        	Antisense Oligonucleotide-mediated Knockdown in Mammary Tumor Organoids.            	Primary mammary tumor organoids grown in 3D are an excellent system to study tumor biology. They resemble the organization and physiology of native epithelia more closely than cancer cell lines grown in 2D, and additionally model interactions with the ECM (Boj et al., 2015; Clevers, 2016; Shamir and Ewald, 2014). Mammary tumor organoids are therefore a promising model system to identify and characterize novel drivers of breast cancer that would be unlikely to be identified using 2D cell lines. Antisense oligonucleotides can be used to efficiently and specifically knockdown target genes in the cell (Bennett et al., 2017). They can be taken up freely by organoids without the need for a transfection agent, making them a convenient tool for routine lab studies and screens.	
33261657        	Cerebral organoids: emerging ex vivo humanoid models of glioblastoma.            	Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer that has seen only marginal improvements in its bleak survival outlook of 12-15 months over the last forty years. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of advanced drug screening platforms and systems that can better recapitulate glioblastoma's infiltrative biology, a process largely responsible for its relentless propensity for recurrence and progression. Recent advances in stem cell biology have allowed the generation of artificial tridimensional brain-like tissue termed cerebral organoids. In addition to their potential to model brain development, these reagents are providing much needed synthetic humanoid scaffolds to model glioblastoma's infiltrative capacity in a faithful and scalable manner. Here, we highlight and review the early breakthroughs in this growing field and discuss its potential future role for glioblastoma research.	
28114961        	MIF/CD74 axis is a target for novel therapies in colon carcinomatosis.            	Strategies aimed at obtaining a complete cytoreduction are needed to improve long-term survival for patients with colorectal cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis (CRC-pc).                We established organoid models from peritoneal metastases of two naïve CRC patients. A standard paraffin inclusion was conducted to compare their 3D structure and immunohistochemical profile with that of the corresponding surgical samples. RNA expression levels of the CRC stem cell marker LGR5 was measured by in situ hybridization. The secretome of organoids was profiled by mass spectrometry. Energy homeostasis of organoids was interfered with 4-IPP and metformin. Biochemical and metabolic changes after drug treatments were investigated by western blot and mass spectrometry. Mitochondria impairment was evaluated by electron microscopy and mitotraker staining.                The two organoids recapitulated their corresponding clinical samples in terms of 3D structure and immmunoistochemical profile and were positive for the cancer stem cells marker LGR5. Proteomic analyses of organoids highlighted their strong dependence on energy producing pathways, which suggest that their targeting could be an effective therapeutic approach. To test this hypothesis, we treated organoids with two drugs that target metabolism acting on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the main regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, which may act as metabolic tumour suppressor in CRC. Organoids were treated with 4-IPP, an inhibitor of MIF/CD74 signalling axis which activates AMPK function, or metformin that inhibits mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. As a new finding we observed that treatment with 4-IPP downregulated AMPK signalling activity, reduced AKT phosphorylation and activated a JNK-mediated stress-signalling response, thus generating mitochondrial impairment and cell death. Metformin treatment enhanced AMPK activation, decreasing the activity of the anabolic factors ribosomal protein S6 and p4EBP-1 and inducing mitochondrial depolarization.                We provide evidence that the modulation of AMPK activity may be a strategy for targeting metabolism of CRC-pc organoids.	
31991800        	Zebrafish Avatars towards Personalized Medicine-A Comparative Review between Avatar Models.            	Cancer frequency and prevalence have been increasing in the past decades, with devastating impacts on patients and their families. Despite the great advances in targeted approaches, there is still a lack of methods to predict individual patient responses, and therefore treatments are tailored according to average response rates. "Omics" approaches are used for patient stratification and choice of therapeutic options towards a more precise medicine. These methods, however, do not consider all genetic and non-genetic dynamic interactions that occur upon drug treatment. Therefore, the need to directly challenge patient cells in a personalized manner remains. The present review addresses the state of the art of patient-derived invitro and invivo models, from organoids to mouse and zebrafish Avatars. The predictive power of each model based on the retrospective correlation with the patient clinical outcome will be considered. Finally, the review is focused on the emerging zebrafish Avatars and their unique characteristics allowing a fast analysis of local and systemic effects of drug treatments at the single-cell level. We also address the technical challenges that the field has yet to overcome.	
20025558        	Characterization of hepatic-organoid cultures.            	Small hepatocytes (SHs) are "committed progenitor cells" that can further differentiate into mature hepatocytes (MHs). SHs can proliferate to form colonies, and the maturation of SHs occurs with the alteration of the cell shape from small and flat to large and rising/piled-up. The hepatic organoids consisting of rising/piled-up cells possess highly differentiated functions like those of MHs and anastomosing networks of bile canaliculi (BC) are developed. The cells can make bile, secrete it into BC, and the bile can be carried without leaking. Thus, the organoids consist of polarized hepatocytes and possess biochemical and physiological functions as hepatic tissue.	
31518438        	BTK inhibitors synergise with 5-FU to treat drug-resistant TP53-null colon cancers.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth cause of death from cancer worldwide mainly due to the high incidence of drug-resistance. During a screen for new actionable targets in drug-resistant tumours we recently identified p65BTK - a novel oncogenic isoform of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Studying three different cohorts of patients here we show that p65BTK expression correlates with histotype and cancer progression. Using drug-resistant TP53-null colon cancer cells as a model we demonstrated that p65BTK silencing or chemical inhibition overcame the 5-fluorouracil resistance of CRC cell lines and patient-derived organoids and significantly reduced the growth of xenografted tumours. Mechanistically, we show that blocking p65BTK in drug-resistant cells abolished a 5-FU-elicited TGFB1 protective response and triggered E2F-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, our data demonstrated that targeting p65BTK restores the apoptotic response to chemotherapy of drug-resistant CRCs and gives a proof-of-concept for suggesting the use of BTK inhibitors in combination with 5-FU as a novel therapeutic approach in CRC patients. © 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

30232220        	Heterozygosity of Chaperone Grp78 Reduces Intestinal Stem Cell Regeneration Potential and Protects against Adenoma Formation.            	Deletion of endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone Grp78 results in activation of the unfolded protein response and causes rapid depletion of the entire intestinal epithelium. Whether modest reduction of Grp78 may affect stem cell fate without compromising intestinal integrity remains unknown. Here, we employ a model of epithelial-specific, heterozygous Grp78 deletion by use of VillinCreERT2-Rosa26ZsGreen/LacZ-Grp78+/fl mice and organoids. We examine models of irradiation and tumorigenesis, both in vitro and in vivo Although we observed no phenotypic changes in Grp78 heterozygous mice, Grp78 heterozygous organoid growth was markedly reduced. Irradiation of Grp78 heterozygous mice resulted in less frequent regeneration of crypts compared with nonrecombined (wild-type) mice, exposing reduced capacity for self-renewal upon genotoxic insult. We crossed mice to Apc-mutant animals for adenoma studies and found that adenomagenesis in Apc heterozygous-Grp78 heterozygous mice was reduced compared with Apc heterozygous controls (1.43 vs. 3.33; P < 0.01). In conclusion, epithelium-specific Grp78 heterozygosity compromises epithelial fitness under conditions requiring expansive growth such as adenomagenesis or regeneration after γ-irradiation. These results suggest that Grp78 may be a therapeutic target in prevention of intestinal neoplasms without affecting normal tissue.Significance: Heterozygous disruption of chaperone protein Grp78 reduces tissue regeneration and expansive growth and protects from tumor formation without affecting intestinal homeostasis.

29367239        	Towards personalized computational oncology: from spatial models of tumour spheroids, to organoids, to tissues.            	A main goal of mathematical and computational oncology is to develop quantitative tools to determine the most effective therapies for each individual patient. This involves predicting the right drug to be administered at the right time and at the right dose. Such an approach is known as precision medicine. Mathematical modelling can play an invaluable role in the development of such therapeutic strategies, since it allows for relatively fast, efficient and inexpensive simulations of a large number of treatment schedules in order to find the most effective. This review is a survey of mathematical models that explicitly take into account the spatial architecture of three-dimensional tumours and address tumour development, progression and response to treatments. In particular, we discuss models of epithelial acini, multicellular spheroids, normal and tumour spheroids and organoids, and multi-component tissues. Our intent is to showcase how these in silico models can be applied to patient-specific data to assess which therapeutic strategies will be the most efficient. We also present the concept of virtual clinical trials that integrate standard-of-care patient data, medical imaging, organ-on-chip experiments and computational models to determine personalized medical treatment strategies.                © 2018 The Author(s).	
32923409        	Murine Endometrial Organoids to Model Chlamydia Infection.            	The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Once internalized in host cells, C. trachomatis undergoes a biphasic developmental cycle within a membrane-bound compartment, known as the inclusion. Successful establishment of the intracellular niche relies on bacterial Type III effector proteins, such as Inc proteins. In vitro and in vivo systems have contributed to elucidating the intracellular lifestyle of C. trachomatis, but additional models combining the archetypal environment of infection with the advantages of in vitro systems are needed. Organoids are three-dimensional structures that recapitulate the microanatomy of an organ's epithelial layer, bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo systems. Organoids are emerging as relevant model systems to study interactions between bacterial pathogens and their hosts. Here, we took advantage of recently developed murine endometrial organoids (EMOs) and present a C. trachomatis-murine EMO infection model system. Confocal microscopy of EMOs infected with fluorescent protein-expressing bacteria revealed that inclusions are formed within the cytosol of epithelial cells. Moreover, infection with a C. trachomatis strain that allows for the tracking of RB to EB transition indicated that the bacteria undergo a full developmental cycle, which was confirmed by harvesting infectious bacteria from infected EMOs. Finally, the inducible gene expression and cellular localization of a Chlamydia Inc protein within infected EMOs further demonstrated that this model is compatible with the study of Type III secreted effectors. Altogether, we describe a novel and relevant system for the study of Chlamydia-host interactions.                Copyright © 2020 Bishop, Boretto, Rutkowski, Vankelecom and Derré.

31083525        	Emerging Roles of C-Myc in Cancer Stem Cell-Related Signaling and Resistance to Cancer Chemotherapy: A Potential Therapeutic Target Against Colorectal Cancer.            	Myc is a nuclear transcription factor that mainly regulates cell growth, cell cycle, metabolism, and survival. Myc family proteins contain c-Myc, n-Myc, and l-Myc. Among them, c-Myc can become a promising therapeutic target molecule in cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are known to be responsible for the therapeutic resistance. In the previous study, we demonstrated that c-Myc mediates drug resistance of colorectal CSCs using a patient-derived primary three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture. In this review, we mainly focus on the roles of c-Myc-related signaling in the regulation of CSCs, chemotherapy resistance, and colorectal cancer organoids. Finally, we introduce the various types of c-Myc inhibitors and propose the possibility of c-Myc as a therapeutic target against colorectal cancer.	
32807988        	Single-cell transcriptomics identifies a distinct luminal progenitor cell type in distal prostate invagination tips.            	The identification of prostate stem/progenitor cells and characterization of the prostate epithelial cell lineage hierarchy are critical for understanding prostate cancer initiation. Here, we characterized 35,129 cells from mouse prostates, and identified a unique luminal cell type (termed type C luminal cell (Luminal-C)) marked by Tacstd2, Ck4 and Psca expression. Luminal-C cells located at the distal prostate invagination tips (termed Dist-Luminal-C) exhibited greater capacity for organoid formation in vitro and prostate epithelial duct regeneration in vivo. Lineage tracing of Luminal-C cells indicated that Dist-Luminal-C cells reconstituted distal prostate luminal lineages through self-renewal and differentiation. Deletion of Pten in Dist-Luminal-C cells resulted in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. We further characterized 11,374 human prostate cells and confirmed the existence of h-Luminal-C cells. Our study provides insights into the prostate lineage hierarchy, identifies Dist-Luminal-C cells as the luminal progenitor cell population in invagination tips and suggests one of the potential cellular origins of prostate cancer.	
32588198        	Generation of 3D human gastrointestinal organoids: principle and applications.            	The stomach and intestine are important organs for food digestion, nutrient absorption, immune protection and hormone production. Gastrointestinal diseases such as cancer and ulcer are big threats to human health. Appropriate disease models are in sore need for mechanistic understanding and drug discovery. Organoids are three-dimensional in vitro cultured structures derived from tissues and pluripotent stem cells with multiple types of cells and mimicking in vivo tissues in major aspects. They have a great potential in regenerative medicine and personalized medicine. Here, we review the major signaling pathways regulating gastrointestinal epithelial homeostasis, summarize different methods to generate human gastrointestinal organoids and highlight their applications in biological research and medical practice.	
30587589        	Toward understanding cancer stem cell heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment.            	The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) formation are two paramount processes driving tumor progression, therapy resistance, and cancer metastasis. Recent experiments show that cells with varying EMT and CSC phenotypes are spatially segregated in the primary tumor. The underlying mechanisms generating such spatiotemporal dynamics in the tumor microenvironment, however, remain largely unexplored. Here, we show through a mechanism-based dynamical model that the diffusion of EMT-inducing signals such as TGF-β, together with noncell autonomous control of EMT and CSC decision making via the Notch signaling pathway, can explain experimentally observed disparate localization of subsets of CSCs with varying EMT phenotypes in the tumor. Our simulations show that the more mesenchymal CSCs lie at the invasive edge, while the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) CSCs reside in the tumor interior. Further, motivated by the role of Notch-Jagged signaling in mediating EMT and stemness, we investigated the microenvironmental factors that promote Notch-Jagged signaling. We show that many inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 that can promote Notch-Jagged signaling can (i) stabilize a hybrid E/M phenotype, (ii) increase the likelihood of spatial proximity of hybrid E/M cells, and (iii) expand the fraction of CSCs. To validate the predicted connection between Notch-Jagged signaling and stemness, we knocked down JAG1 in hybrid E/M SUM149 human breast cancer cells in vitro. JAG1 knockdown significantly restricted tumor organoid formation, confirming the key role that Notch-Jagged signaling can play in tumor progression. Together, our integrated computational-experimental framework reveals the underlying principles of spatiotemporal dynamics of EMT and CSCs.	
29023715        	A new parameter of growth inhibition for cell proliferation assays.            	Cell proliferation assays are performed by four decades to test the anti-proliferative activity of natural products and synthetic compounds in cell cultures. In cancer research, they are widely employed to evaluate drug efficacy in in vitro tumor models, such as established cell lines, primary cultures, and recently developed three-dimensional tumor organoids. In this manuscript, we demonstrated that current employed parameters used by researchers to quantify in vitro growth inhibition, IC50 and GI50 , lead to a misinterpretation of results based on the exponential, and not linear, proliferation of the cells in culture. Therefore, we introduce a new parameter for the analysis of growth inhibition in cell proliferation assays, termed relative population doubling capacity, that can be employed to properly quantify the anti-proliferative activity of tested compounds and to compare drug efficacy between distinct cell models.                © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
29353739        	Generation of matched patient-derived xenograft in vitro-in vivo models using 3D macroporous hydrogels for the study of liver cancer.            	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, often manifesting at the advanced stage when cure is no longer possible. The discrepancy between preclinical findings and clinical outcome in HCC is well-recognized. So far, sorafenib is the only targeted therapy approved as first-line therapy for patients with advanced HCC. There is an urgent need for improved preclinical models for the development of HCC-targeted therapies. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor models have been shown to closely recapitulate human tumor biology and predict patient drug response. However, the use of PDX models is currently limited by high costs and low throughput. In this study, we engineered in vitro conditions conducive for the culture of HCC-PDX organoids derived from a panel of 14 different HCC-PDX lines through the use of a three-dimensional macroporous cellulosic sponge system. To validate the in vitro HCC-PDX models, both in vivo and in vitro HCC-PDX models were subjected to whole exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing. Correlative studies indicate strong concordance in genomic and transcriptomic profiles as well as intra-tumoral heterogeneity between each matched in vitro-in vivo HCC-PDX pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of using these in vitro HCC-PDX models for drug testing, paving the way for more efficient preclinical studies in HCC drug development.

32355746        	Enhanced glutamine utilization mediated by SLC1A5 and GPT2 is an essential metabolic feature of colorectal signet ring cell carcinoma with therapeutic potential.            	Colorectal signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is characterized as a rare subset of colorectal cancer with extremely poor prognosis and it is known to have low or negative 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake. To date, no in-depth study revealing the metabolic features of colorectal SRCC has been conducted for the lack of reliable study model. The aim of this study was to explore the distinct characteristics of energy utilization for colorectal SRCC based on organoid model.                Three organoids were derived from colorectal SRCC patients with low or negative FDG uptake and three organoids were derived from colorectal adenocarcinoma (AC) patients. Glucose, fatty acid and glutamine uptake assays were performed to reveal the different metabolic features of SRCC organoids. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting and real-time PCR were used to test the expression of critical transporters and enzymes of energy metabolism. Glutamine deprivation analyses were used to confirm the dependence of colorectal SRCC on glutamine.                Glucose, fatty acid and glutamine uptake assays showed that only glutamine uptake was significantly increased in colorectal SRCC organoids compared with paired normal organoids. Comparing SRCC organoids with AC organoids indicated that glucose and fatty acid uptake were strikingly higher in AC organoids while glutamine uptake was notably lower. Gene expression analyses confirmed that the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 and glutaminolysis enzyme GPT2 were significantly unregulated in colorectal SRCC. Silencing of SLC1A5 or GPT2 could suppress the proliferation of SRCC organoids but attenuating the sensitivity of SRCC to glutamine deprivation. Administration of SLC1A5 or GPT2 inhibitor could prohibit SRCC growth and significantly enhance the sensitivity of SRCC to the treatment of 5-fu and L-OHP.                This study highlights enhanced glutamine uptake and glutaminolysis as a metabolic feature of colorectal SRCC and a potential therapeutic target.                2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

28493978        	Identification of the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 as a potential survival biomarker in breast cancer.            	Metastasis is the ultimate cause of breast cancer related mortality. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to play a crucial role in the metastatic potential of breast cancer. Growing evidence has implicated the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 in the regulation of EMT in mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer metastasis. However, the relevance of PIAS1 in human cancer and mechanisms by which PIAS1 might regulate breast cancer metastasis remain to be elucidated. Using tissue-microarray analysis (TMA), we report that the protein abundance and subcellular localization of PIAS1 correlate with disease specific overall survival of a cohort of breast cancer patients. In mechanistic studies, we find that PIAS1 acts via sumoylation of the transcriptional regulator SnoN to suppress invasive growth of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell-derived organoids. Our studies thus identify the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, and suggest a potential role for the PIAS1-SnoN sumoylation pathway in controlling breast cancer metastasis.	
25406066        	miR-142 regulates the tumorigenicity of human breast cancer stem cells through the canonical WNT signaling pathway.            	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of stem and progenitor cell functions. We previously reported that miR-142 and miR-150 are upregulated in human breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) as compared to the non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells. In this study, we report that miR-142 efficiently recruits the APC mRNA to an RNA-induced silencing complex, activates the canonical WNT signaling pathway in an APC-suppression dependent manner, and activates the expression of miR-150. Enforced expression of miR-142 or miR-150 in normal mouse mammary stem cells resulted in the regeneration of hyperproliferative mammary glands in vivo. Knockdown of endogenous miR-142 effectively suppressed organoid formation by BCSCs and slowed tumor growth initiated by human BCSCs in vivo. These results suggest that in some tumors, miR-142 regulates the properties of BCSCs at least in part by activating the WNT signaling pathway and miR-150 expression.	
30459183        	The secret lives of cancer cell lines.            	The extent of genetic and epigenetic diversity between and within patient tumors is being mapped in ever more detail. It is clear that cancer is an evolutionary process in which tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic forces shape clonal selection. The pre-clinical oncology pipeline uses model systems of human cancer - including mouse models, cell lines, patient-derived organoids and patient-derived xenografts - to study tumor biology and assess the efficacy of putative therapeutic agents. Model systems cannot completely replicate the environment of human tumors and, even within the same cancer model, data are often irreproducible between laboratories. One hypothesis is that ongoing evolutionary processes remain relevant in laboratory models, leading to divergence over time. In a recent edition of Nature, Ben-David and colleagues showed that different stocks of widely used cancer cell lines - a staple of cancer research over many decades - are highly heterogeneous in terms of their genetics, transcriptomics and responses to therapies. The authors find compelling evidence of positive selection based on ongoing mutational processes and chromosomal instability. Thus, the origin, culture conditions and cumulative number of population doublings of cell lines likely influence experimental outcomes. Here, we summarize the key findings of this important study and discuss the practical implications of this work for researchers using cell lines in the laboratory.                © 2018.

27264173        	The Action of Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 in Basal Tumor Cells and Stromal Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Is Critical for Breast Cancer Metastasis.            	High levels of collagen deposition in human and mouse breast tumors are associated with poor outcome due to increased local invasion and distant metastases. Using a genetic approach, we show that, in mice, the action of the fibrillar collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in both tumor and tumor-stromal cells is critical for breast cancer metastasis yet does not affect primary tumor growth. In tumor cells, DDR2 in basal epithelial cells regulates the collective invasion of tumor organoids. In stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), DDR2 is critical for extracellular matrix production and the organization of collagen fibers. The action of DDR2 in CAFs also enhances tumor cell collective invasion through a pathway distinct from the tumor-cell-intrinsic function of DDR2. This work identifies DDR2 as a potential therapeutic target that controls breast cancer metastases through its action in both tumor cells and tumor-stromal cells at the primary tumor site.

31547988        	Epithelial Wntless is dispensable for intestinal tumorigenesis in mouse models.            	Wnt signaling is essential for the maintenance of adult stem cells and its aberrant activation is a stimulator of carcinogenesis. The transmembrane protein, Wntless, is an essential Wnt signaling component through regulating the secretion of Wnt ligands. Here, we generated a mouse model with specific Wntless knockout in intestinal epithelium to study its function in the intestinal epithelium. Wntless knockout exhibits no obvious defects in mice but significantly disrupted proliferation and differentiation of small intestinal organoids. We also discovered that these deficiencies could be partially rescued by Wnt3a supplement but not Wnt9b. To further investigate the role of Wntless in tumorigenesis, APC-deficient spontaneous intestinal tumors and chemical induced colorectal cancer mouse models were employed. To our surprise, intestinal epithelium-specific knockout of Wntless did not cause significant differences in tumor number and size. In summary, our data demonstrated that epithelial Wntless was required for the growth and differentiation of small intestinal organoids but not in live animals, suggesting the other tissues, such as mesenchymal tissue, play critical role for Wnt secretion in both intestinal homeostasis as well as tumorigenesis.

28716720        	MET Signaling Mediates Intestinal Crypt-Villus Development, Regeneration, and Adenoma Formation and Is Promoted by Stem Cell CD44 Isoforms.            	Resistance of metastatic human colorectal cancer cells to drugs that block epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling could be caused by aberrant activity of other receptor tyrosine kinases, activating overlapping signaling pathways. One of these receptor tyrosine kinases could be MET, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We investigated how MET signaling, and its interaction with CD44 (a putative MET coreceptor regulated by Wnt signaling and highly expressed by intestinal stem cells [ISCs] and adenomas) affects intestinal homeostasis, regeneration, and adenoma formation in mini-gut organoids and mice.                We established organoid cultures from ISCs stimulated with HGF or EGF and assessed intestinal differentiation by immunohistochemistry. Mice with total epithelial disruption of MET (AhCre/Metfl/fl/LacZ) or ISC-specific disruption of MET (Lgr5Creert2/Metfl/fl/LacZ) and control mice (AhCre/Met+/+/LacZ, Lgr5Creert2/Met+/+/LacZ) were exposed to 10 Gy total body irradiation; intestinal tissues were collected, and homeostasis and regeneration were assessed by immunohistochemistry. We investigated adenoma organoid expansion stimulated by HGF or EGF using adenomas derived from Lgr5Creert2/Metfl/fl/Apcfl/fl and Lgr5Creert2/Met+/+/Apcfl/fl mice. The same mice were evaluated for adenoma prevalence and size. We also quantified adenomas in AhCre/Metfl/fl/Apcfl/+ mice compared with AhCre/Met+/+/Apcfl/+ control mice. We studied expansion of organoids generated from crypts and adenomas, stimulated by HGF or EGF, that were derived from mice expressing different CD44 splice variants (Cd44+/+, Cd44-/-, Cd44s/s, or Cd44v4-10/v4-10 mice).                Crypts incubated with EGF or HGF expanded into self-organizing mini-guts with similar levels of efficacy and contained all differentiated cell lineages. MET-deficient mice did not have defects in intestinal homeostasis. Total body irradiation reduced numbers of proliferating crypts in AhCre/Metfl/fl/LacZ mice. Lgr5Creert2/Metfl/fl/LacZ mice had impaired regeneration of MET-deficient ISCs. Adenoma organoids stimulated with EGF or HGF expanded to almost twice the size of nonstimulated organoids. MET-deficient adenoma organoids did not respond to HGF stimulation, but did respond to EGF. ISC-specific disruption of Met (Lgr5Creert2/Metfl/fl/Apcfl/fl mice) caused a twofold increase in apoptosis in microadenomas, resulting in an approximately 50% reduction of microadenoma numbers and significantly reduced average adenoma size. Total epithelial disruption of Met (AhCre/Metfl/fl/Apcfl/+ mice) resulted in an approximate 50% reduction in (micro)adenoma numbers. Intestinal crypts from Cd44-/- mice did not expand to the same extent as crypts from Cd44+/+ mice on stimulation with HGF, but had the same response to EGF. The negative effect on HGF-mediated growth was overcome by expression of CD44v4-10, but not by CD44s. Similarly, HGF-mediated expansion of adenoma organoids required CD44v4-10.                In studies of intestinal organoid cultures and mice with inducible deletion of MET, we found HGF receptor signaling to regulate intestinal homeostasis and regeneration, as well as adenoma formation. These activities of MET are promoted by the stem cell CD44 isoform CD44v4-10. Our findings provide rationale for targeting signaling via MET and CD44 during anti-EGF receptor therapy of patients with colorectal cancer or in patients resistant to EGF receptor inhibitors.

32731171        	Rapid Processing and Drug Evaluation in Glioblastoma Patient-Derived Organoid Models with 4D Bioprinted Arrays.            	Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly primary brain malignancy. Despite advances in precision medicine oncology (PMO) allowing the identification of molecular vulnerabilities in glioblastoma, treatment options remain limited, and molecular assays guided by genomic and expression profiling to inform patient enrollment in life-saving trials are lacking. Here, we generate four-dimensional (4D) cell-culture arrays for rapid assessment of drug responses in glioblastoma patient-derived models. The arrays are 3D printed with thermo-responsive shape memory polymer (SMP). Upon heating, the SMP arrays self-transform in time from 3D cell-culture inserts into histological cassettes. We assess the utility of these arrays with glioblastoma cells, gliospheres, and patient derived organoid-like (PDO) models and demonstrate their use with glioblastoma PDOs for assessing drug sensitivity, on-target activity, and synergy in drug combinations. When including genomic and drug testing assays, this platform is poised to offer rapid functional drug assessments for future selection of therapies in PMO.

31773090        	The promises and challenges of patient-derived tumor organoids in drug development and precision oncology.            	In the era of precision medicine, cancer researchers and oncologists are eagerly searching for more realistic, cost effective, and timely tumor models to aid drug development and precision oncology. Tumor models that can faithfully recapitulate the histological and molecular characteristics of various human tumors will be extremely valuable in increasing the successful rate of oncology drug development and discovering the most efficacious treatment regimen for cancer patients. Two-dimensional (2D) cultured cancer cell lines, genetically engineered mouse tumor (GEMT) models, and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models have been widely used to investigate the biology of various types of cancers and test the efficacy of oncology drug candidates. However, due to either the failure to faithfully recapitulate the complexity of patient tumors in the case of 2D cultured cancer cells, or high cost and untimely for drug screening and testing in the case of GEMT and PDTX, new tumor models are urgently needed. The recently developed patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTO) offer great potentials in uncovering novel biology of cancer development, accelerating the discovery of oncology drugs, and individualizing the treatment of cancers. In this review, we will summarize the recent progress in utilizing PDTO for oncology drug discovery. In addition, we will discuss the potentials and limitations of the current PDTO tumor models.                © 2019 The Authors.

23318418        	Constitutive TLR4 signalling in intestinal epithelium reduces tumor load by increasing apoptosis in APC(Min/+) mice.            	The microbial pattern-recognizing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are major signal transducers known to shape and influence the postnatal maturation of host intestinal epithelium. Perturbations in this intricate host-microbe cross-talk have been reported to be associated with uncontrolled epithelial cell growth and thus potential cancer development by mechanisms which are largely unknown. We therefore generated transgenic mice carrying a constitutively active TLR4 (CD4-TLR4) linked to an intestinal epithelial cell-specific promoter. Ex vivo analysis of transgenic crypt-villus organoid cultures revealed an increased proliferative capacity and a lowered cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) expression in these organoids compared with wild-type control cultures. Introducing the CD4-TLR4 transgene into APC(Min/+) mice (CD4-TLR4-APC(Min/+)), a model of colorectal carcinoma, resulted in a dramatic drop in tumor load as compared with control APC(Min/+) mice. Intestinal tumors from CD4-TLR4-APC(Min/+) mice displayed reduced Cox-2 protein, elevated interferon β expression and increased caspase-3 activity, which correlated with increased apoptosis in vivo. Thus, our data reveal that host microbiota-mediated signal transduction via TLR4 in intestinal epithelial cells is far more complex than what is previously reported.	
32407674        	High-Resolution mRNA and Secretome Atlas of Human Enteroendocrine Cells.            	Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) sense intestinal content and release hormones to regulate gastrointestinal activity, systemic metabolism, and food intake. Little is known about the molecular make-up of human EEC subtypes and the regulated secretion of individual hormones. Here, we describe an organoid-based platform for functional studies of human EECs. EEC formation is induced in vitro by transient expression of NEUROG3. A set of gut organoids was engineered in which the major hormones are fluorescently tagged. A single-cell mRNA atlas was generated for the different EEC subtypes, and their secreted products were recorded by mass-spectrometry. We note key differences to murine EECs, including hormones, sensory receptors, and transcription factors. Notably, several hormone-like molecules were identified. Inter-EEC communication is exemplified by secretin-induced GLP-1 secretion. Indeed, individual EEC subtypes carry receptors for various EEC hormones. This study provides a rich resource to study human EEC development and function.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
24560652        	Epithelial stem cells and intestinal cancer.            	The mammalian intestine is comprised of an epithelial layer that serves multiple functions in order to maintain digestive activity as well as intestinal homeostasis. This epithelial layer contains highly proliferative stem cells which facilitate its characteristic rapid regeneration. How these stem cells contribute to tissue repair and normal homeostasis are actively studied, and while we have a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms and cellular locations that underlie stem cell regulation in this tissue, much still remains undiscovered. This review describes epithelial stem cells in both intestinal and non-intestinal tissues, as well as the strategies that have been used to further characterize the cells. Through a discussion of the current understanding of intestinal self-renewal and tissue regeneration in response to injury, we focus on how dysregulation of critical signaling pathways results in potentially oncogenic aberrations, and highlight issues that should be addressed in order for effective intestinal cancer therapies to be devised.

30078722        	Binding of TMPRSS2-ERG to BAF Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Mediates Prostate Oncogenesis.            	Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in the fusion of TMPRSS2, an androgen-regulated gene, and the ETS family transcription factor ERG occur in over half of prostate cancers. However, the mechanism by which ERG promotes oncogenic gene expression and proliferation remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify a binding interaction between ERG and the mammalian SWI/SNF (BAF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, which is conserved among other oncogenic ETS factors, including ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. We find that ERG drives genome-wide retargeting of BAF complexes in a manner dependent on binding of ERG to the ETS DNA motif. Moreover, ERG requires intact BAF complexes for chromatin occupancy and BAF complex ATPase activity for target gene regulation. In a prostate organoid model, BAF complexes are required for ERG-mediated basal-to-luminal transition, a hallmark of ERG activity in prostate cancer. These observations suggest a fundamental interdependence between ETS transcription factors and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes in cancer.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

24477561        	Rotary bioreactor culture can discern specific behavior phenotypes in Trk-null and Trk-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines.            	Neuroblastoma is characterized by biological and genetic heterogeneity that leads to diverse, often unpredictable, clinical behavior. Differential expression of the Trk family of neurotrophin receptors strongly correlates with clinical behavior; TrkA expression is associated with favorable outcome, whereas TrkB with unfavorable outcome. Neuroblastoma cells cultured in a microgravity rotary bioreactor spontaneously aggregate into tumor-like structures, called organoids. We wanted to determine if the clinical heterogeneity of TrkA- or TrkB-expressing neuroblastomas was reflected in aggregation kinetics and organoid morphology. Trk-null SY5Y cells were stably transfected to express either TrkA or TrkB. Short-term aggregation kinetics were determined by counting the number of single (non-aggregated) viable cells in the supernatant over time. Organoids were harvested after 8 d of bioreactor culture, stained, and analyzed morphometrically. SY5Y-TrkA cells aggregated significantly slower than SY5Y and SY5Y-TrkB cells, as quantified by several measures of aggregation. SY5Y and TrkB cell lines formed irregularly shaped organoids, featuring stellate projections. In contrast, TrkA cells formed smooth (non-stellate) organoids. SY5Y organoids were slightly smaller on average, but had significantly larger average perimeter than TrkA or TrkB organoids. TrkA expression alone is sufficient to dramatically alter the behavior of neuroblastoma cells in three-dimensional, in vitro rotary bioreactor culture. This pattern is consistent with both clinical behavior and in vivo tumorigenicity, in that SY5Y-TrkA represents a more differentiated, less aggressive phenotype. The microgravity bioreactor is a useful in vitro tool to rapidly investigate the biological characteristics of neuroblastoma and potentially to assess the effect of cytotoxic as well as biologically targeted drugs.

33009488        	De novo induction of lineage plasticity from human prostate luminal epithelial cells by activated AKT1 and c-Myc.            	Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer that either develops de novo or arises from prostate adenocarcinoma as a result of treatment resistance. Although the prostate basal cells have been shown to directly generate tumor cells with neuroendocrine features when transduced with oncogenic signaling, the identity of the cell-of-origin for de novo NEPC remains unclear. We show that the TACSTD2high human prostate luminal epithelia cells highly express SOX2 and are relatively enriched in the transition zone prostate. Both TACSTD2high and TACSTD2low luminal cells transduced by constitutively activated AKT1 (caAKT1), and c-Myc can form organoids containing versatile clinically relevant tumor cell lineages with regard to the expression of AR and the neuroendocrine cell markers Synaptophysin and Chromogranin A. Tumor organoid cells derived from the TACSTD2high luminal cells are more predisposed to neuroendocrine differentiation along passaging and are relatively more castration-resistant. Knocking down TACSTD2 and SOX2 both attenuate neuroendocrine differentiation of tumor organoid cells. This study demonstrates de novo neuroendocrine differentiation of the human prostate luminal epithelial cells induced by caAKT1 and c-Myc and reveals an impact of cellular status on initiation of lineage plasticity.	
33015026        	Organoids to Study Intestinal Nutrient Transport, Drug Uptake and Metabolism - Update to the Human Model and Expansion of Applications.            	Intestinal transport and sensing processes and their interconnection to metabolism are relevant to pathologies such as malabsorption syndromes, inflammatory diseases, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Constituting a highly selective barrier, intestinal epithelial cells absorb, metabolize, and release nutrients into the circulation, hence serving as gatekeeper of nutrient availability and metabolic health for the whole organism. Next to nutrient transport and sensing functions, intestinal transporters including peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) are involved in the absorption of drugs and prodrugs, including certain inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, protease inhibitors, antivirals, and peptidomimetics like β-lactam antibiotics. Here, we verify the applicability of 3D organoids for in vitro investigation of intestinal biochemical processes related to transport and metabolism of nutrients and drugs. Establishing a variety of methodologies including illustration of transporter-mediated nutrient and drug uptake and metabolomics approaches, we highlight intestinal organoids as robust and reliable tool in this field of research. Currently used in vitro models to study intestinal nutrient absorption, drug transport and enterocyte metabolism, such as Caco-2 cells or rodent explant models are of limited value due to their cancer and non-human origin, respectively. Particularly species differences result in poorly correlative data and findings obtained in these models cannot be extrapolated reliably to humans, as indicated by high failure rates in drug development pipelines. In contrast, human intestinal organoids represent a superior model of the intestinal epithelium and might help to implement the 3Rs (Reduction, Refinement and Replacement) principle in basic science as well as the preclinical and regulatory setup.

30177706        	Ap4 is rate limiting for intestinal tumor formation by controlling the homeostasis of intestinal stem cells.            	The gene encoding the transcription factor TFAP4/AP4 represents a direct target of the c-MYC oncoprotein. Here, we deleted Ap4 in ApcMin mice, a preclinical model of inherited colorectal cancer. Ap4 deficiency extends their average survival by 110 days and decreases the formation of intestinal adenomas and tumor-derived organoids. The effects of Ap4 deletion are presumably due to the reduced number of functional intestinal stem cells (ISCs) amenable to adenoma-initiating mutational events. Deletion of Ap4 also decreases the number of colonic stem cells and increases the number of Paneth cells. Expression profiling revealed that ISC signatures, as well as the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling pathways are downregulated in Ap4-deficient adenomas and intestinal organoids. AP4-associated signatures are conserved between murine adenomas and human colorectal cancer samples. Our results establish Ap4 as rate-limiting mediator of adenoma initiation, as well as regulator of intestinal and colonic stem cell and Paneth cell homeostasis.	
29580808        	Basement membrane destruction by pancreatic stellate cells leads to local invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.            	Stroma invasion is an important step in pancreatic cancer progression. However, how pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with ductal structure invades the surrounding stroma has not been clear. Here, we elucidated the mechanism of stromal invasion of PDAC, using organoids. From resected PDAC specimens, we established human PDAC organoids, which developed ductal and basement membrane (BM) structures. When the organoids were co-cultured with pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) in a collagen matrix, organoids lost their BM and ductal structures, and invaded collagen matrix more frequently than did mono-cultured organoids. Interestingly, direct contact by PSCs to PDAC organoids was observed before BM destruction. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 or membrane type-1 MMP (MT1MMP) knockdown in PSCs significantly attenuated BM destruction by PSCs, and retained the ductal structures in organoids. Our results imply that direct contact by PSCs induces BM destruction and stromal invasion of PDAC via MMP2 which binds to MT1MMP on PSCs.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

31059499        	Oct1/Pou2f1 is selectively required for colon regeneration and regulates colon malignancy.            	The transcription factor Oct1/Pou2f1 promotes poised gene expression states, mitotic stability, glycolytic metabolism and other characteristics of stem cell potency. To determine the effect of Oct1 loss on stem cell maintenance and malignancy, we deleted Oct1 in two different mouse gut stem cell compartments. Oct1 deletion preserved homeostasis in vivo and the ability to establish organoids in vitro, but blocked the ability to recover from treatment with dextran sodium sulfate, and the ability to maintain organoids after passage. In a chemical model of colon cancer, loss of Oct1 in the colon severely restricted tumorigenicity. In contrast, loss of one or both Oct1 alleles progressively increased tumor burden in a colon cancer model driven by loss-of-heterozygosity of the tumor suppressor gene Apc. The different outcomes are consistent with prior findings that Oct1 promotes mitotic stability, and consistent with differentially expressed genes between the two models. Oct1 ChIPseq using HCT116 colon carcinoma cells identifies target genes associated with mitotic stability, metabolism, stress response and malignancy. This set of gene targets overlaps significantly with genes differentially expressed in the two tumor models. These results reveal that Oct1 is selectively required for recovery after colon damage, and that Oct1 has potent effects in colon malignancy, with outcome (pro-oncogenic or tumor suppressive) dictated by tumor etiology.	
29303405        	Focal adhesion kinase a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.            	The non-receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is known to play a key role in a variety of normal and cancer cellular functions such as survival, proliferation, migration and invasion. It is highly active and overexpressed in various cancers including Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). Here, initially, we demonstrate that FAK is overexpressed in both PDAC and MPM cell lines. Then we analyze effects of two small molecule inhibitors PF-573228, and PF-431396, which are dual specificity inhibitors of FAK and proline rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), as well as VS-6063, another small molecule inhibitor that specifically inhibits FAK but not PYK2 for cell growth, motility and invasion of PDAC and MPM cell lines. Treatment with PF-573228, PF-431396 and VS-6063 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of growth and anchorage-independent colony formation in both cancer cell lines. Furthermore, these compounds suppressed the phosphorylation of FAK at its active site, Y397, and functionally induced significant apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in both cell lines. Using the ECIS (Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing) system, we found that treatment of both PF compounds suppressed adherence and migration of PDAC cells on fibronectin. Interestingly, 3D-tumor organoids derived from autochthonous KC (Kras;PdxCre) mice treated with PF-573228 revealed a significant decrease in tumor organoid size and increase in organoid cell death. Taken together, our results show that FAK is an important target for mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer therapy that merit further translational studies.	
32085439        	Personalized Assessment of Normal Tissue Radiosensitivity via Transcriptome Response to Photon, Proton and Carbon Irradiation in Patient-Derived Human Intestinal Organoids.            	Radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity often limits the curative treatment of cancer. Moreover, normal tissue relative biological effectiveness data for high-linear energy transfer particles are urgently needed. We propose a strategy based on transcriptome analysis of patient-derived human intestinal organoids (HIO) to determine molecular surrogates for radioresponse of gastrointestinal (GI) organs at risk in a personalized manner. HIO were generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), which were derived from skin biopsies of three patients, including two patients with FANCA deficiency as a paradigm for enhanced radiosensitivity. For the two Fanconi anemia (FA) patients (HIO-104 and 106, previously published as FA-A#1 IND-iPS1 and FA-A#2 IND-iPS3), FANCA expression was reconstituted as a prerequisite for generation of HIO via lentiviral expression of a doxycycline inducible construct. For radiosensitivity analysis, FANCA deficient and FANCA rescued as well as wtHIO were sham treated or irradiated with 4Gy photon, proton or carbon ions at HIT, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining of HIO for 53BP1-foci was performed 1 h post IR and gene expression analyses was performed 12 and 48 h post IR. 53BP1-foci numbers and size correlated with the higher RBE of carbon ions. A FANCA dependent differential gene expression in response to radiation was found (p < 0.01, ANOVA; n = 1071 12 h; n = 1100 48 h). Pathways associated with FA and DNA-damage repair i.e., transcriptional coupled nucleotide excision repair, homology-directed repair and translational synthesis were found to be differentially regulated in FANCA deficient HIO. Next, differential regulated genes were investigated as a function of radiation quality (RQ, p < 0.05, ANOVA; n = 742 12 h; n = 553 48 h). Interestingly, a gradual increase or decrease of gene expression was found to correlate with the three main qualities, from photon to proton and carbon irradiation. Clustering separated high-linear energy transfer irradiation with carbons from proton and photon irradiation. Genes associated with dual incision steps of TC-NER were differentially regulated in photon vs. proton and carbon irradiation. Consequently, SUMO3, ALC1, POLE4, PCBP4, MUTYH expression correlated with the higher RBE of carbon ions. An interaction between the two studied parameters FA and RQ was identified (p < 0.01, 2-way ANOVA n = 476). A comparison of genes regulated as a function of FA, RQ and RBE suggest a role for p53 interacting genes BRD7, EWSR1, FBXO11, FBXW8, HMGB1, MAGED2, PCBP4, and RPS27 as modulators of FA in response to radiation. This proof of concept study demonstrates that patient tailored evaluation of GI response to radiation is feasible via generation of HIO and comparative transcriptome profiling. This methodology can now be further explored for a personalized assessment of GI radiosensitivity and RBE estimation.	
33103125        	Generating Patient-Derived Gliomas within Cerebral Organoids.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a devastating disease with a median survival of less than two years. Current preclinical models are unable to accurately reflect the complexity of human GBM. We recently established a cerebral organoid glioma (GLICO) model to study the invasion and biology of patient-derived glioma stem cells in miniature replicas of the human brain. Through the dissemination of our detailed methodology, we aim to encourage other scientists to further build upon our existing model for studying these destructive tumors.

28634945        	Analysis of Breast Cancer Cell Invasion Using an Organotypic Culture System.            	Metastasis is the main cause of cancer patient mortality. Local tumor invasion is a key step in metastatic dissemination whereby cancer cells dislodge from primary tumors, migrate through the peritumoral stroma and reach the circulation. This is a highly dynamic process occurring in three dimensions that involves interactions between tumor, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix. Here we describe the organotypic culture system and its utility to study breast cancer cell invasion induced by cancer-associated fibroblasts. This is a three-dimensional model that reproduces the biochemical and physiological properties of real tissue and allows for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms involving tumor and its microenvironment, and their contribution to cancer cell invasion . This system provides a robust, accurate, and reproducible method for measuring cancer cell invasion and represents a valuable tool to improve the mechanistic understanding of the initial steps in metastasis .	
28634961        	Quantitative Phenotypic Image Analysis of Three-Dimensional Organotypic Cultures.            	Glandular epithelial cells differentiate into three-dimensional (3D) multicellular or acinar structures, particularly when embedded in laminin-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). The spectrum of different multicellular morphologies formed in 3D is a reliable indicator for the differentiation potential of normal, non-transformed cells compared to different stages of malignant progression. Motile cancer cells may actively invade the matrix, utilizing epithelial, mesenchymal, or mixed modes of motility. Dynamic phenotypic changes involved in 3D tumor cell invasion are also very sensitive to small-molecule inhibitors that, e.g., target the actin cytoskeleton. Our strategy is to recapitulate the formation and the histology of complex solid cancer tissues in vitro, based on cell culture technologies that promote the intrinsic differentiation potential of normal and transformed epithelial cells, and also including stromal fibroblasts and other key components of the tumor microenvironment. We have developed a streamlined stand-alone software solution that supports the detailed quantitative phenotypic analysis of organotypic 3D cultures. This approach utilizes the power of automated image analysis as a phenotypic readout in cell-based assays. AMIDA (Automated Morphometric Image Data Analysis) allows quantitative measurements of a large number of multicellular structures, which can form a multitude of different organoid shapes, sizes, and textures according to their capacity to engage in epithelial differentiation programs or not. At the far end of this spectrum of tumor-relevant differentiation properties, there are highly invasive tumor cells or multicellular structures that may rapidly invade the surrounding ECM, but fail to form higher-order epithelial tissue structures. Furthermore, this system allows us to monitor dynamic changes that can result from the extraordinary plasticity of tumor cells, e.g., epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in live cell settings. Furthermore, AMIDA supports an automated workflow, and can be combined with quality control and statistical tools for data interpretation and visualization. Our approach supports the growing needs for user-friendly, straightforward solutions that facilitate cell-based organotypic 3D assays in basic research, drug discovery, and target validation.

30737492        	Induced pluripotent stem cells in disease modelling and drug discovery.            	The derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) over a decade ago sparked widespread enthusiasm for the development of new models of human disease, enhanced platforms for drug discovery and more widespread use of autologous cell-based therapy. Early studies using directed differentiation of iPSCs frequently uncovered cell-level phenotypes in monogenic diseases, but translation to tissue-level and organ-level diseases has required development of more complex, 3D, multicellular systems. Organoids and human-rodent chimaeras more accurately mirror the diverse cellular ecosystems of complex tissues and are being applied to iPSC disease models to recapitulate the pathobiology of a broad spectrum of human maladies, including infectious diseases, genetic disorders and cancer.

32181976        	PMEPA1/TMEPAI isoforms function via its PY and Smad-interaction motifs for tumorigenic activities of breast cancer cells.            	PMEPA1 (prostate transmembrane protein, androgen-induced 1)/TMEPAI (transmembrane prostate androgen-induced protein) is highly expressed in diverse cancers, including breast, lung and prostate cancers. It consists of four isoforms with distinct extracellular regions (isoforms a-d). The expression and function of these isoforms are still poorly understood. Hence, we aimed to identify the preferentially expressed isoforms in breast cancer cells and analyze possible differences in tumorigenic functions. In this study, we used 5' Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) and Western blot analyses to identify the mRNA variants and protein isoforms of TMEPAI and found that TMEPAI isoform d as the major isoform expressed by TGF-β stimulation in breast cancer cells. We then generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TMEPAI knockout (KO) breast cancer cell lines and used a lentiviral expression system to complement each isoform individually. Although there were no clear functional differences between isoforms, double PPxY (PY) motifs and a Smad-interaction motif (SIM) of TMEPAI were both essential for colony and sphere formation. Collectively, our results provide a novel insight into TMEPAI isoforms in breast cancer cells and showed that coordination between double PY motifs and a SIM of TMEPAI are essential for colony and sphere formation but not for monolayer cell proliferation.                © 2020 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.	
24332913        	Collective invasion in breast cancer requires a conserved basal epithelial program.            	Carcinomas typically invade as a cohesive multicellular unit, a process termed collective invasion. It remains unclear how different subpopulations of cancer cells contribute to this process. We developed three-dimensional (3D) organoid assays to identify the most invasive cancer cells in primary breast tumors. Collective invasion was led by specialized cancer cells that were defined by their expression of basal epithelial genes, such as cytokeratin-14 (K14) and p63. Furthermore, K14+ cells led collective invasion in the major human breast cancer subtypes. Importantly, luminal cancer cells were observed to convert phenotypically to invasive leaders following induction of basal epithelial genes. Although only a minority of cells within luminal tumors expressed basal epithelial genes, knockdown of either K14 or p63 was sufficient to block collective invasion. Our data reveal that heterotypic interactions between epithelial subpopulations are critical to collective invasion. We suggest that targeting the basal invasive program could limit metastatic progression.                 Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
26649819        	Interleukin-22 promotes intestinal-stem-cell-mediated epithelial regeneration.            	Epithelial regeneration is critical for barrier maintenance and organ function after intestinal injury. The intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche provides Wnt, Notch and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signals supporting Lgr5(+) crypt base columnar ISCs for normal epithelial maintenance. However, little is known about the regulation of the ISC compartment after tissue damage. Using ex vivo organoid cultures, here we show that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), potent producers of interleukin-22 (IL-22) after intestinal injury, increase the growth of mouse small intestine organoids in an IL-22-dependent fashion. Recombinant IL-22 directly targeted ISCs, augmenting the growth of both mouse and human intestinal organoids, increasing proliferation and promoting ISC expansion. IL-22 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in Lgr5(+) ISCs, and STAT3 was crucial for both organoid formation and IL-22-mediated regeneration. Treatment with IL-22 in vivo after mouse allogeneic bone marrow transplantation enhanced the recovery of ISCs, increased epithelial regeneration and reduced intestinal pathology and mortality from graft-versus-host disease. ATOH1-deficient organoid culture demonstrated that IL-22 induced epithelial regeneration independently of the Paneth cell niche. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism by which the immune system is able to support the intestinal epithelium, activating ISCs to promote regeneration.

31704731        	Genomic Characteristics of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Nominate Molecular Subtypes That Predict Chemotherapy Response.            	The heterogeneity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses difficulties for suitable treatment and leads to poor outcome. This study aimed to define a consensus molecular subtype (CMS) of TNBC and thus elucidate genomic characteristics and relevant therapy. We integrated the expression profiles of 957 TNBC samples from published datasets. We identified genomic characteristics of subtype by exploring the pathway activity, microenvironment, and clinical relevance. In addition, drug response (DR) scores (n = 181) were computationally investigated using chemical perturbation gene signatures and validated in our own patient with TNBC (n = 38) who received chemotherapy and organoid biobank data (n = 64). Subsequently, cooperative functions with drugs were also explored. Finally, we classified TNBC into four CMSs: stem-like; mesenchymal-like; immunomodulatory; luminal-androgen receptor. CMSs also elucidated distinct tumor-associated microenvironment and pathway activities. Furthermore, we discovered metastasis-promoting genes, such as secreted phosphoprotein 1 by comparing with primary. Computational DR scores associated with CMS revealed drug candidates (n = 18), and it was successfully evaluated in cisplatin response of both patients and organoids. Our CMS recapitulated in-depth functional and cellular heterogeneity encompassing primary and metastatic TNBC. We suggest DR scores to predict CMS-specific DRs and to be successfully validated. Finally, our approach systemically proposes a relevant therapeutic prediction model as well as prognostic markers for TNBC. IMPLICATIONS: We delineated the genomic characteristic and computational DR prediction for TNBC CMS from gene expression profile. Our systematic approach provides diagnostic markers for subtype and metastasis verified by machine-learning and novel therapeutic candidates for patients with TNBC.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
29604290        	Intestinal Failure and Aberrant Lipid Metabolism in Patients With DGAT1 Deficiency.            	Congenital diarrheal disorders are rare inherited intestinal disorders characterized by intractable, sometimes life-threatening, diarrhea and nutrient malabsorption; some have been associated with mutations in diacylglycerol-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), which catalyzes formation of triacylglycerol from diacylglycerol and acyl-CoA. We investigated the mechanisms by which DGAT1 deficiency contributes to intestinal failure using patient-derived organoids.                We collected blood samples from 10 patients, from 6 unrelated pedigrees, who presented with early-onset severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, hypoalbuminemia, and/or (fatal) protein-losing enteropathy with intestinal failure; we performed next-generation sequencing analysis of DNA from 8 patients. Organoids were generated from duodenal biopsies from 3 patients and 3 healthy individuals (controls). Caco-2 cells and patient-derived dermal fibroblasts were transfected or transduced with vectors that express full-length or mutant forms of DGAT1 or full-length DGAT2. We performed CRISPR/Cas9-guided disruption of DGAT1 in control intestinal organoids. Cells and organoids were analyzed by immunoblot, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, chromatography, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and for the activity of caspases 3 and 7.                In the 10 patients, we identified 5 bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in DGAT1. In patient-derived fibroblasts and organoids, the mutations reduced expression of DGAT1 protein and altered triacylglycerol metabolism, resulting in decreased lipid droplet formation after oleic acid addition. Expression of full-length DGAT2 in patient-derived fibroblasts restored formation of lipid droplets. Organoids derived from patients with DGAT1 mutations were more susceptible to lipid-induced cell death than control organoids.                We identified a large cohort of patients with congenital diarrheal disorders with mutations in DGAT1 that reduced expression of its product; dermal fibroblasts and intestinal organoids derived from these patients had altered lipid metabolism and were susceptible to lipid-induced cell death. Expression of full-length wildtype DGAT1 or DGAT2 restored normal lipid metabolism in these cells. These findings indicate the importance of DGAT1 in fat metabolism and lipotoxicity in the intestinal epithelium. A fat-free diet might serve as the first line of therapy for patients with reduced DGAT1 expression. It is important to identify genetic variants associated with congenital diarrheal disorders for proper diagnosis and selection of treatment strategies.                Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

32371581        	Functional miRNA Screening Identifies Wide-ranging Antitumor Properties of miR-3622b-5p and Reveals a New Therapeutic Combination Strategy in Ovarian Tumor Organoids.            	Novel therapeutic strategies are urgently required for the clinical management of chemoresistant ovarian carcinoma, which is the most lethal of the gynecologic malignancies. miRNAs hold promise because they play a critical role in determining the cell phenotype by regulating several hundreds of targets, which could constitute vulnerabilities of cancer cells. A combination of gain-of-function miRNA screening and real-time continuous cell monitoring allows the identification of miRNAs with robust cytotoxic effects in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. Focusing on miR-3622b-5p, we show that it induces apoptosis in several ovarian cancer cell lines by both directly targeting Bcl-xL and EGFR-mediating BIM upregulation. miR-3622b-5p also sensitizes cells to cisplatin by inhibiting Bcl-xL in ovarian cancer cell lines escaping BIM induction. miR-3622b-5p also exerts antimigratory capacities by targeting both LIMK1 and NOTCH1. These wide-ranging antitumor properties of miR-3622b-5p in ovarian cancer cells are mimicked by the associations of pharmacologic inhibitors targeting these proteins. The combination of an EGFR inhibitor together with a BH3-mimetic molecule induced a large decrease in cell viability in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and several ovarian patient-derived tumor organoids, suggesting the value of pursuing such a combination therapy in ovarian carcinoma. Altogether, our work highlights the potential of phenotype-based miRNA screening approaches to identify lethal interactions which might lead to new drug combinations and clinically applicable strategies.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
27698416        	Tissue-specific mutation accumulation in human adult stem cells during life.            	The gradual accumulation of genetic mutations in human adult stem cells (ASCs) during life is associated with various age-related diseases, including cancer. Extreme variation in cancer risk across tissues was recently proposed to depend on the lifetime number of ASC divisions, owing to unavoidable random mutations that arise during DNA replication. However, the rates and patterns of mutations in normal ASCs remain unknown. Here we determine genome-wide mutation patterns in ASCs of the small intestine, colon and liver of human donors with ages ranging from 3 to 87 years by sequencing clonal organoid cultures derived from primary multipotent cells. Our results show that mutations accumulate steadily over time in all of the assessed tissue types, at a rate of approximately 40 novel mutations per year, despite the large variation in cancer incidence among these tissues. Liver ASCs, however, have different mutation spectra compared to those of the colon and small intestine. Mutational signature analysis reveals that this difference can be attributed to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine residues in the colon and small intestine, probably reflecting their high ASC division rate. In liver, a signature with an as-yet-unknown underlying mechanism is predominant. Mutation spectra of driver genes in cancer show high similarity to the tissue-specific ASC mutation spectra, suggesting that intrinsic mutational processes in ASCs can initiate tumorigenesis. Notably, the inter-individual variation in mutation rate and spectra are low, suggesting tissue-specific activity of common mutational processes throughout life.	
29384527        	Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells promote colorectal cancer cell death under low-dose irradiation.            	Radiotherapy remains one of the cornerstones to improve the outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Radiotherapy of the CRC not only help to destroy cancer cells but also remodel the tumour microenvironment by enhancing tumour-specific tropism of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (BM-MSC) from the peripheral circulation. However, the role of local MSCs and recruited BM-MSC under radiation were not well defined. Indeed, the functions of BM-MSC without irradiation intervention remained controversial in tumour progression: BM-MSC was previously shown to modulate the immune function of major immune cells, resulting in an impaired immunological sensitivity and to induce an increased risk of tumour recurrence. In contrast, it could also secrete various cytokines and possess anticancer effect.                Three co-cultivation modules, 3D culture modules, and cancer organoids were established. The induction of cytokines secretion in hBM-MSCs after irradiation was analysed by ELISA array and flow cytometry. AutoMac separator was used to separate hBM-MSC and CRC automatically. Cells from the co-cultured group and the control group were then irradiated by UV-C lamp and X-ray. Proliferation assay and viability assay were performed.                In this study, we show that BM-MSCs can induce the EMT progression of CRC cells in vitro. When irradiated with low doses of ultraviolet radiation and X-rays, BM-MSCs show an anti-tumour effect by secreting certain cytokine (TNF-α, IFN-γ) that lead to the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of CRC cells. This was further verified in a 3D culture model of a CRC cell in vitro. Furthermore, irradiation on the co-culture system induced the cleavage of caspase3, and attenuated the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase in cancer cells. The signal pathways above might contribute to the cancer cell death.                Taken together, we show that BM-MSC can potentially promote the effect of radiotherapy in CRC.	
28916657        	Tenascin-C and Integrin α9 Mediate Interactions of Prostate Cancer with the Bone Microenvironment.            	Deposition of the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C is part of the reactive stroma response, which has a critical role in prostate cancer progression. Here, we report that tenascin C is expressed in the bone endosteum and is associated with formation of prostate bone metastases. Metastatic cells cultured on osteo-mimetic surfaces coated with tenascin C exhibited enhanced adhesion and colony formation as mediated by integrin α9β1. In addition, metastatic cells preferentially migrated and colonized tenascin-C-coated trabecular bone xenografts in a novel system that employed chorioallantoic membranes of fertilized chicken eggs as host. Overall, our studies deepen knowledge about reactive stroma responses in the bone endosteum that accompany prostate cancer metastasis to trabecular bone, with potential implications to therapeutically target this process in patients.

32523990        	Generation of self-organized sensory ganglion organoids and retinal ganglion cells from fibroblasts.            	Neural organoids provide a powerful tool for investigating neural development, modeling neural diseases, screening drugs, and developing cell-based therapies. Somatic cells have previously been reprogrammed by transcription factors (TFs) into sensory ganglion (SG) neurons but not SG organoids. We identify a combination of triple TFs Ascl1, Brn3b/3a, and Isl1 (ABI) as an efficient means to reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into self-organized and networked induced SG (iSG) organoids. The iSG neurons exhibit molecular features, subtype diversity, electrophysiological and calcium response properties, and innervation patterns characteristic of peripheral sensory neurons. Moreover, we have defined retinal ganglion cell (RGC)-specific identifiers to demonstrate the ability for ABI to reprogram induced RGCs (iRGCs) from fibroblasts. Unlike iSG neurons, iRGCs maintain a scattering distribution pattern characteristic of endogenous RGCs. iSG organoids may serve as a model to decipher the pathogenesis of sensorineural diseases and screen effective drugs and a source for cell replacement therapy.

28336548        	Nutrient sensing by absorptive and secretory progenies of small intestinal stem cells.            	Nutrient sensing triggers responses by the gut-brain axis modulating hormone release, feeding behavior and metabolism that become dysregulated in metabolic syndrome and some cancers. Except for absorptive enterocytes and secretory enteroendocrine cells, the ability of many intestinal cell types to sense nutrients is still unknown; hence we hypothesized that progenitor stem cells (intestinal stem cells, ISC) possess nutrient sensing ability inherited by progenies during differentiation. We directed via modulators of Wnt and Notch signaling differentiation of precursor mouse intestinal crypts into specialized organoids each containing ISC, enterocyte, goblet, or Paneth cells at relative proportions much higher than in situ as determined by mRNA expression and immunocytochemistry of cell type biomarkers. We identified nutrient sensing cell type(s) by increased expression of fructolytic genes in response to a fructose challenge. Organoids comprised primarily of enterocytes, Paneth, or goblet, but not ISC, cells responded specifically to fructose without affecting nonfructolytic genes. Sensing was independent of Wnt and Notch modulators and of glucose concentrations in the medium but required fructose absorption and metabolism. More mature enterocyte- and goblet-enriched organoids exhibited stronger fructose responses. Remarkably, enterocyte organoids, upon forced dedifferentiation to reacquire ISC characteristics, exhibited a markedly extended lifespan and retained fructose sensing ability, mimicking responses of some dedifferentiated cancer cells. Using an innovative approach, we discovered that nutrient sensing is likely repressed in progenitor ISCs then irreversibly derepressed during specification into sensing-competent absorptive or secretory lineages, the surprising capacity of Paneth and goblet cells to detect fructose, and the important role of differentiation in modulating nutrient sensing.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Small intestinal stem cells differentiate into several cell types transiently populating the villi. We used specialized organoid cultures each comprised of a single cell type to demonstrate that 1) differentiation seems required for nutrient sensing, 2) secretory goblet and Paneth cells along with enterocytes sense fructose, suggesting that sensing is acquired after differentiation is triggered but before divergence between absorptive and secretory lineages, and 3) forcibly dedifferentiated enterocytes exhibit fructose sensing and lifespan extension.

28947782        	Microchamber Cultures of Bladder Cancer: A Platform for Characterizing Drug Responsiveness and Resistance in PDX and Primary Cancer Cells.            	Precision cancer medicine seeks to target the underlying genetic alterations of cancer; however, it has been challenging to use genetic profiles of individual patients in identifying the most appropriate anti-cancer drugs. This spurred the development of patient avatars; for example, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) established in mice and used for drug exposure studies. However, PDXs are associated with high cost, long development time and low efficiency of engraftment. Herein we explored the use of microfluidic devices or microchambers as simple and low-cost means of maintaining bladder cancer cells over extended periods of times in order to study patterns of drug responsiveness and resistance. When placed into 75 µm tall microfluidic chambers, cancer cells grew as ellipsoids reaching millimeter-scale dimeters over the course of 30 days in culture. We cultured three PDX and three clinical patient specimens with 100% success rate. The turn-around time for a typical efficacy study using microchambers was less than 10 days. Importantly, PDX-derived ellipsoids in microchambers retained patterns of drug responsiveness and resistance observed in PDX mice and also exhibited in vivo-like heterogeneity of tumor responses. Overall, this study establishes microfluidic cultures of difficult-to-maintain primary cancer cells as a useful tool for precision cancer medicine.	
32908310        	Adaptable haemodynamic endothelial cells for organogenesis and tumorigenesis.            	Endothelial cells adopt tissue-specific characteristics to instruct organ development and regeneration1,2. This adaptability is lost in cultured adult endothelial cells, which do not vascularize tissues in an organotypic manner. Here, we show that transient reactivation of the embryonic-restricted ETS variant transcription factor 2 (ETV2)3 in mature human endothelial cells cultured in a serum-free three-dimensional matrix composed of a mixture of laminin, entactin and type-IV collagen (LEC matrix) 'resets' these endothelial cells to adaptable, vasculogenic cells, which form perfusable and plastic vascular plexi. Through chromatin remodelling, ETV2 induces tubulogenic pathways, including the activation of RAP1, which promotes the formation of durable lumens4,5. In three-dimensional matrices-which do not have the constraints of bioprinted scaffolds-the 'reset' vascular endothelial cells (R-VECs) self-assemble into stable, multilayered and branching vascular networks within scalable microfluidic chambers, which are capable of transporting human blood. In vivo, R-VECs implanted subcutaneously in mice self-organize into durable pericyte-coated vessels that functionally anastomose to the host circulation and exhibit long-lasting patterning, with no evidence of malformations or angiomas. R-VECs directly interact with cells within three-dimensional co-cultured organoids, removing the need for the restrictive synthetic semipermeable membranes that are required for organ-on-chip systems, therefore providing a physiological platform for vascularization, which we call 'Organ-On-VascularNet'. R-VECs enable perfusion of glucose-responsive insulin-secreting human pancreatic islets, vascularize decellularized rat intestines and arborize healthy or cancerous human colon organoids. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetic profiling, we demonstrate that R-VECs establish an adaptive vascular niche that differentially adjusts and conforms to organoids and tumoroids in a tissue-specific manner. Our Organ-On-VascularNet model will permit metabolic, immunological and physiochemical studies and screens to decipher the crosstalk between organotypic endothelial cells and parenchymal cells for identification of determinants of endothelial cell heterogeneity, and could lead to advances in therapeutic organ repair and tumour targeting.	
31345097        	GREM2 maintains stem cell-like phenotypes in gastric cancer cells by regulating the JNK signaling pathway.            	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the major malignancies worldwide. This study was conducted to explore the mechanism by which GREM2 maintains biological properties of GC stem cells (GCSCs), and proved that GREM2 could potentially regulate the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration and tumorigenic ability of GCSCs through the regulation of the JNK signaling pathway. In silico analysis was utilized to retrieve expression microarray related to GC, and differential analysis was conducted. The cell line with the highest GREM2 expression was overexpressed with GREM2 mimic, silencing GREM2 by siRNA, or treated with activator or inhibitor of the JNK signaling pathway. Subsequently, expression of GREM2, JNK signaling pathway-, apoptosis- or migration and invasion-associated factors were determined. Proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis of GCSCs in vitro and tumorigenic ability and lymph node metastasis of GCSCs in vivo were determined. Based on the in silico analysis of GSE49051, GREM2 was determined to be overexpressed in GC and its expression was the highest in the MKN-45 cell line, which was selected for the subsequent experiments. Silencing of GREM2 or inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion, while promoting apoptosis of GCSCs in vitro as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis and lymph node metastasis in vivo. In conclusion, the aforementioned findings suggest that the silencing of GREM2 suppresses the activation of the JNK signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting tumor progression. Therefore, GREM2-mediated JNK signaling pathway was expected to be a new therapeutic strategy for GC.

32728212        	The gut microbiome switches mutant p53 from tumour-suppressive to oncogenic.            	Somatic mutations in p53, which inactivate the tumour-suppressor function of p53 and often confer oncogenic gain-of-function properties, are very common in cancer1,2. Here we studied the effects of hotspot gain-of-function mutations in Trp53 (the gene that encodes p53 in mice) in mouse models of WNT-driven intestinal cancer caused by Csnk1a1 deletion3,4 or ApcMin mutation5. Cancer in these models is known to be facilitated by loss of p533,6. We found that mutant versions of p53 had contrasting effects in different segments of the gut: in the distal gut, mutant p53 had the expected oncogenic effect; however, in the proximal gut and in tumour organoids it had a pronounced tumour-suppressive effect. In the tumour-suppressive mode, mutant p53 eliminated dysplasia and tumorigenesis in Csnk1a1-deficient and ApcMin/+ mice, and promoted normal growth and differentiation of tumour organoids derived from these mice. In these settings, mutant p53 was more effective than wild-type p53 at inhibiting tumour formation. Mechanistically, the tumour-suppressive effects of mutant p53 were driven by disruption of the WNT pathway, through preventing the binding of TCF4 to chromatin. Notably, this tumour-suppressive effect was completely abolished by the gut microbiome. Moreover, a single metabolite derived from the gut microbiota-gallic acid-could reproduce the entire effect of the microbiome. Supplementing gut-sterilized p53-mutant mice and p53-mutant organoids with gallic acid reinstated the TCF4-chromatin interaction and the hyperactivation of WNT, thus conferring a malignant phenotype to the organoids and throughout the gut. Our study demonstrates the substantial plasticity of a cancer mutation and highlights the role of the microenvironment in determining its functional outcome.

31212027        	Mini-gut: a promising model for drug development.            	Until recently, major advances in drug development have been hampered by a lack of proper cell and tissue models; but the introduction of organoid technology has revolutionized this field. At the level of the gastrointestinal tract, the so-called mini-gut comprises all major cell types of native intestine and recapitulates the composition and function of native intestinal epithelium. The mini-gut can be classified as an intestinal organoid (IO), derived from pluripotent stem cells, or as an enteroid, consisting only of epithelial cells and generated from adult stem cells. Both classifications have been used as models to develop drugs against cystic fibrosis, cancer and infectious disease, as well as for drug screening, personalized medicine and the development of new medical tools. In this review, we highlight and discuss the importance of mini-guts for drug development and point out their limitations and future prospects.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

28358093        	A distinct role for Lgr5+ stem cells in primary and metastatic colon cancer.            	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been hypothesized to represent the driving force behind tumour progression and metastasis, making them attractive cancer targets. However, conclusive experimental evidence for their functional relevance is still lacking for most malignancies. Here we show that the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) identifies intestinal CSCs in mouse tumours engineered to recapitulate the clinical progression of human colorectal cancer. We demonstrate that selective Lgr5+ cell ablation restricts primary tumour growth, but does not result in tumour regression. Instead, tumours are maintained by proliferative Lgr5- cells that continuously attempt to replenish the Lgr5+ CSC pool, leading to rapid re-initiation of tumour growth upon treatment cessation. Notably, CSCs are critical for the formation and maintenance of liver metastasis derived from colorectal cancers. Together, our data highlight distinct CSC dependencies for primary versus metastasic tumour growth, and suggest that targeting CSCs may represent a therapeutic opportunity for managing metastatic disease.	
31416966        	MYC promotes tryptophan uptake and metabolism by the kynurenine pathway in colon cancer.            	Tumors display increased uptake and processing of nutrients to fulfill the demands of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Seminal studies have shown that the proto-oncogene MYC promotes metabolic reprogramming by altering glutamine uptake and metabolism in cancer cells. How MYC regulates the metabolism of other amino acids in cancer is not fully understood. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we found that MYC increased intracellular levels of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway. MYC induced the expression of the tryptophan transporters SLC7A5 and SLC1A5 and the enzyme arylformamidase (AFMID), involved in the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine. SLC7A5, SLC1A5, and AFMID were elevated in colon cancer cells and tissues, and kynurenine was significantly greater in tumor samples than in the respective adjacent normal tissue from patients with colon cancer. Compared with normal human colonic epithelial cells, colon cancer cells were more sensitive to the depletion of tryptophan. Blocking enzymes in the kynurenine pathway caused preferential death of established colon cancer cells and transformed colonic organoids. We found that only kynurenine and no other tryptophan metabolite promotes the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Blocking the interaction between AHR and kynurenine with CH223191 reduced the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Therefore, we propose that limiting cellular kynurenine or its downstream targets could present a new strategy to reduce the proliferation of MYC-dependent cancer cells.                © 2019 Venkateswaran et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
25307862        	In vitro expansion of human gastric epithelial stem cells and their responses to bacterial infection.            	We previously established long-term, 3-dimensional culture of organoids from mouse tissues (intestine, stomach, pancreas, and liver) and human intestine and pancreas. Here we describe conditions required for long-term 3-dimensional culture of human gastric stem cells. The technology can be applied to study the epithelial response to infection with Helicobacter pylori.                We generated organoids from surgical samples of human gastric corpus. Culture conditions were developed based on those for the mouse gastric and human intestinal systems. We used microinjection to infect the organoids with H pylori. Epithelial responses were measured using microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses.                Human gastric cells were expanded indefinitely in 3-dimensional cultures. We cultured cells from healthy gastric tissues, single-sorted stem cells, or tumor tissues. Organoids maintained many characteristics of their respective tissues based on their histology, expression of markers, and euploidy. Organoids from healthy tissue expressed markers of 4 lineages of the stomach and self-organized into gland and pit domains. They could be directed to specifically express either lineages of the gastric gland, or the gastric pit, by addition of nicotinamide and withdrawal of WNT. Although gastric pit lineages had only marginal reactions to bacterial infection, gastric gland lineages mounted a strong inflammatory response.                We developed a system to culture human gastric organoids. This system can be used to study H pylori infection and other gastric pathologies.                Copyright © 2015 AGA Institute.

33086077        	Intestinal Organoids: A Tool for Modelling Diet-Microbiome-Host Interactions.            	Dietary patterns, microbiome dysbiosis, and gut microbial metabolites (GMMs) have a pivotal role in the homeostasis of intestinal epithelial cells and in disease progression, such as that of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although GMMs and microorganisms have crucial roles in many biological activities, models for deciphering diet-microbiome-host relationships are largely limited to animal models. Thus, intestinal organoids (IOs) have provided unprecedented opportunities for the generation of in vitro platforms with the sufficient level of complexity to model physiological and pathological diet-microbiome-host conditions. Overall, IO responses to GMM metabolites and microorganisms can provide new insights into the mechanisms by which those agents may prevent or trigger diseases, significantly extending our knowledge of diet-microbiome-host interactions.

32350444        	Spermine oxidase mediates Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric inflammation, DNA damage, and carcinogenic signaling.            	Helicobacter pylori infection is the main risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. H. pylori colonizes the human gastric mucosa and persists for decades. The inflammatory response is ineffective in clearing the infection, leading to disease progression that may result in gastric adenocarcinoma. We have shown that polyamines are regulators of the host response to H. pylori, and that spermine oxidase (SMOX), which metabolizes the polyamine spermine into spermidine plus H2O2, is associated with increased human gastric cancer risk. We now used a molecular approach to directly address the role of SMOX, and demonstrate that Smox-deficient mice exhibit significant reductions of gastric spermidine levels and H. pylori-induced inflammation. Proteomic analysis revealed that cancer was the most significantly altered functional pathway in Smox-/- gastric organoids. Moreover, there was also less DNA damage and β-catenin activation in H. pylori-infected Smox-/- mice or gastric organoids, compared to infected wild-type animals or gastroids. The link between SMOX and β-catenin activation was confirmed in human gastric organoids that were treated with a novel SMOX inhibitor. These findings indicate that SMOX promotes H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis by causing inflammation, DNA damage, and activation of β-catenin signaling.	
30899415        	Utilizing cell line-derived organoids to evaluate the efficacy of a novel LIFR-inhibitor, EC359 in targeting pancreatic tumor stroma.            	Survival of pancreatic cancer (PC) patient is poor due to lack of effective treatment modalities, which is partly due to the presence of dense desmoplasia that impedes the delivery of chemotherapeutics. Therefore, PC stroma-targeting therapies are expected to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. However, in vitro evaluation of stromal-targeted therapies requires a culture system which includes components of both tumor stroma and parenchyma. We aim to generate a cell line-derived 3D organoids to test the efficacy of stromal-targeted, LIFR-inhibitor EC359. Murine PC (FC1245) and stellate (ImPaSC) cells were cultured to generate organoids that recapitulated the histological organization of PC with the formation of ducts by epithelial cells surrounded by activated fibroblasts, as indicated by CK19 and α-SMA staining, respectively. Analysis by qRT-PCR demonstrated a significant downregulation of markers of activated stroma, POSTN, FN1, MMP9, and SPARC (p<0.0001), when treated with gemcitabine in combination with EC359. Concurrently, collagen proteins including COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, and COL5A1 were significantly downregulated (p <0.0001) after treatment with gemcitabine in combination with EC359. Overall, our study demonstrates the utility of cell lines-derived 3D organoids to evaluate the efficacy of stroma-targeted therapies as well as the potential of EC359 to target activated stroma in PC.	
30599048        	A C/EBPα-Wnt connection in gut homeostasis and carcinogenesis.            	We explored the connection between C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α) and Wnt signaling in gut homeostasis and carcinogenesis. C/EBPα was expressed in human and murine intestinal epithelia in the transit-amplifying region of the crypts and was absent in intestinal stem cells and Paneth cells with activated Wnt signaling. In human colorectal cancer and murine APCMin/+ polyps, C/EBPα was absent in the nuclear β-catenin-positive tumor cells. In chemically induced intestinal carcinogenesis, C/EBPα KO in murine gut epithelia increased tumor volume. C/EBPα deletion extended the S-phase cell zone in intestinal organoids and activated typical proliferation gene expression signatures, including that of Wnt target genes. Genetic activation of β-catenin in organoids attenuated C/EBPα expression, and ectopic C/EBPα expression in HCT116 cells abrogated proliferation. C/EBPα expression accompanied differentiation of the colon cancer cell line Caco-2, whereas β-catenin stabilization suppressed C/EBPα. These data suggest homeostatic and oncogenic suppressor functions of C/EBPα in the gut by restricting Wnt signaling.	
31836665        	Infection-induced signals generated at the plasma membrane epigenetically regulate Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo.            	Wnt signaling regulates immunomodulatory functions during infection and inflammation. Employing NCCIT and HCT116 cells, having high endogenous Wnt signaling, we observed elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) and Frizzled class receptor 10 (FZD10) and increases in β-catenin, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), CD44 molecule (CD44), and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1). siRNA-induced knockdown of these receptors antagonized TOPflash reporter activity and spheroid growth in vitro and elevated Wnt-inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) activity. Elevated mRNA and protein levels of LRP5/6 and FZD10 paralleled expression of WNT2b and WNT4 in colonic crypts at days 6 and 12 post-infection with Citrobacter rodentium (CR) and tended to decline at days 20-34. The CR mutant escV or the tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 attenuated these responses. A three-dimensional organoid assay in colonic crypts isolated from CR-infected mice revealed elevated levels of LRP5/6 and FZD10 and β-catenin co-localization with enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2). Co-immunoprecipitation in the membrane fraction revealed that axin associates with LRP5/6 in CR-infected crypts, and this association was correlated with increased β-catenin. Colon tumors from either CR-infected ApcPMin/+ or azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-treated mice had high LRP5/6 or FZD10 levels, and chronic Notch blockade through the γ-secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine down-regulated LRP5/6 and FZD10 expression. In CR-responsive CT-26 cells, siRNA-induced LRP5/6 or FZD10 knockdown antagonized TOPflash reporter activity. Elevated miR-153-3p levels correlated with LRP5/6 and FZD10, and miR-153-3p sequestration via a plasmid-based miR inhibitor system attenuated Wnt signaling. We conclude that infection-induced signals from the plasma membrane epigenetically regulate Wnt signaling.                © 2020 Ahmed et al.	PDB                                            3S2K
32399776        	In Vitro Modeling of the Tumor Microenvironment in Tumor Organoids.            	The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents the many components occupying the space within and surrounding a tumor, including cells, signaling factors, extracellular matrix, and vasculature. Each component has the potential to assume many forms and functions which in turn contribute to the overall state of the TME, and further contribute to the progression and disposition of the tumor itself. The sum of these components can drive a tumor towards progression, keep a migratory tumor at bay, or even control chemotherapeutic response. The wide potential for interaction that the TME is an integral part of a tumor's ecosystem, and it is imperative to include it when studying and modeling cancer in vitro. Fortunately, the development of tissue engineering and biofabrication technologies and methodologies have allowed widespread inclusion of TME-based factors into in vitro tissue-equivalent models.                In this review, we compiled contemporary literature sources to provide an overview of the field of TME models, ranging from simple to complex.                We have identified important components of the TME, how they can be included in in vitro study, and cover examples across a range of cancer types.                Our goal with this text is to provide a foundation for prospective research into the TME.	
29212028        	Non-Canonical Hedgehog Signaling Is a Positive Regulator of the WNT Pathway and Is Required for the Survival of Colon Cancer Stem Cells.            	Colon cancer is a heterogeneous tumor driven by a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). To study CSCs in colon cancer, we used limiting dilution spheroid and serial xenotransplantation assays to functionally define the frequency of CSCs in a panel of patient-derived cancer organoids. These studies demonstrated cancer organoids to be enriched for CSCs, which varied in frequency between tumors. Whole-transcriptome analysis identified WNT and Hedgehog signaling components to be enhanced in CSC-enriched tumors and in aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSCs. Canonical GLI-dependent Hedgehog signaling is a negative regulator of WNT signaling in normal intestine and intestinal tumors. Here, we show that Hedgehog signaling in colon CSCs is autocrine SHH-dependent, non-canonical PTCH1 dependent, and GLI independent. In addition, using small-molecule inhibitors and RNAi against SHH-palmitoylating Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT), we demonstrate that non-canonical Hedgehog signaling is a positive regulator of WNT signaling and required for colon CSC survival.

We highlight the opportunities that iPSC models can provide beyond those offered by existing systems and animal models and present current challenges and crucial areas for future improvements toward wider adoption of this technology.	
32636115        	Spotlight on the current perspectives on applications of human blood cell culture and organoids: Introductory remarks.            	Culture of blood cells, mainly erythrocytes, at industrial levels complying with cGMP regulations, aim to make them available, at large scale, any time and everywhere, when needed for transfusion, or laboratory applications. Understanding how blood cells differentiate and develop in-vivo, and mechanisms of differentiation and growth factors, has opened newer strategies for in-vitro culture from multipotent stem cells or immortalized lines. This offers interesting perspectives for obtaining such cultured bioproduct cells for medical applications. In addition, many attempts for preparing platelets in-vitro from megakaryocyte culture have been reported. Nevertheless, the quantities of functional viable platelets obtained are still not sufficient to envisage transfusion applications. Other strategic approaches concern culture of organoids, which can synthesize functional blood proteins, but still significant scale-up of yield needs to be addressed. Finally, considerable advances have been made in culturing specific lymphocytes for personalized immunotherapy of some cancer patients with highly promising results in certain applications. This concise mini report focuses on the progress made in these directions, and attempts are made to describe some newer perspectives.                Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	
32705634        	Analysis of Aged Dysfunctional Intestinal Stem Cells.            	Aging is a multifactorial process. Organ maintenance and tissue regeneration are impaired upon aging mainly due to loss of stem cell function in organs that depend on stem cell in the adult. Intestine is such an organ, and upon aging intestinal regeneration is impaired due to decline of intestinal stem cell function. To determine the aging status of intestine and intestinal stem cells, histological analyses; analyses of the level of proliferation markers in tissue by immunofluorescence and/or quantitative RT-PCR; and gene expression analysis for stemness related genes in isolated crypts, intestinal stem cells (ISC), and Paneth cells can be used. To analyze the level of regeneration in intestine and thus determine a decline in ISC function, techniques like in vitro organoid cultures and lineage tracing with BrdU, lineage tracing using transgenic mice and histological analyses of tissue regeneration after 3 and 5 days after two rounds of 10 Gy of radiation (a 10 + 10 Gy IR experiment) can be applied. In this chapter we will focus on protocols for lineage tracing, the 10 + 10 gy IR experiment and for organoid cultures from young and aged mouse intestine.Lineage tracing experiments in intestine can be done in many ways. In this chapter we describe a protocol for lineage tracing upon BrdU incorporation and lineage tracing using the Lgr5eGFPCreERT2 Rosa26YFP transgenic mouse. For BrdU based-lineage tracing BrdU is administrated via intraperitoneal injections into mice. Animals will be analyzed 3 days (72 h) after BrdU administration. For experiments involving Lgr5eGFPCreERT2 Rosa26YFP mice, mice will be analyzed after tamoxifen injection that activates Cre in Lgr5 positive (ISC) cells, which will result in permanent YFP expression. This allows for tracing of YFP positive cells in the intestine. The time point for the analysis of the intestinal tissue will depend in this case on the underlying scientific question that will be addressed. For 10 + 10 Gy experiments, animals will be irradiated with a radiation dose of 10 Gy on 2 consecutive days. The intestinal tissue will be analyzed 3 and 5 days after the second dose of radiation. Quantitative analyses of crypt depth and determination of the rate of crypt fission upon histochemistry will provide an estimation on the in vivo regenerative potential of ISCs. For serial organoid culture experiments, crypts will be harvested from mouse intestine, initially plated at concentrations ranging from 500 to 1000 crypts per well in Matrigel and grown in conditional medium or ISC medium. ISC Medium is changed every 2 days. After 1 week in culture, the organoids will be disrupted via a syringe and replated in fresh Matrigel. As the ability to form multilobed organoids is considered to be a direct stem cell function, the frequency of organoid formation in serial replating experiments can serve as a quantitative measurement of ISC function. For example, we demonstrated a reduced frequency of organoid formation as well as a reduction in number of lobes formed per organoid after 4-5 replatings of intestinal organoids from aged compared to young mice. These three techniques are thus, in combination, able to quantify the regeneration potential of intestinal stem cells and thus determine the extent to which intestinal stem cell regenerative function is reduced upon aging.	
30283976        	Potential application of cell reprogramming techniques for cancer research.            	The ability to control the transition from an undifferentiated stem cell to a specific cell fate is one of the key techniques that are required for the application of interventional technologies to regenerative medicine and the treatment of tumors and metastases and of neurodegenerative diseases. Reprogramming technologies, which include somatic cell nuclear transfer, induced pluripotent stem cells, and the direct reprogramming of specific cell lineages, have the potential to alter cell plasticity in translational medicine for cancer treatment. The characterization of cancer stem cells (CSCs), the identification of oncogene and tumor suppressor genes for CSCs, and the epigenetic study of CSCs and their microenvironments are important topics. This review summarizes the application of cell reprogramming technologies to cancer modeling and treatment and discusses possible obstacles, such as genetic and epigenetic alterations in cancer cells, as well as the strategies that can be used to overcome these obstacles to cancer research.	
28549415        	Role of peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) in mammary carcinoma cell migration.            	Penetration of the mammary gland basement membrane by cancer cells is a crucial first step in tumor invasion. Using a mouse model of ductal carcinoma in situ, we previously found that inhibition of peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2, aka PADI2) activity appears to maintain basement membrane integrity in xenograft tumors. The goal of this investigation was to gain insight into the mechanisms by which PAD2 mediates this process.                For our study, we modulated PAD2 activity in mammary ductal carcinoma cells by lentiviral shRNA-mediated depletion, lentiviral-mediated PAD2 overexpression, or PAD inhibition and explored the effects of these treatments on changes in cell migration and cell morphology. We also used these PAD2-modulated cells to test whether PAD2 may be required for EGF-induced cell migration. To determine how PAD2 might promote tumor cell migration in vivo, we tested the effects of PAD2 inhibition on the expression of several cell migration mediators in MCF10DCIS.com xenograft tumors. In addition, we tested the effect of PAD2 inhibition on EGF-induced ductal invasion and elongation in primary mouse mammary organoids. Lastly, using a transgenic mouse model, we investigated the effects of PAD2 overexpression on mammary gland development.                Our results indicate that PAD2 depletion or inhibition suppresses cell migration and alters the morphology of MCF10DCIS.com cells. In addition, we found that PAD2 depletion suppresses the expression of the cytoskeletal regulatory proteins RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 and also promotes a mesenchymal to epithelial-like transition in tumor cells with an associated increase in the cell adhesion marker, E-cadherin. Our mammary gland organoid study found that inhibition of PAD2 activity suppresses EGF-induced ductal invasion. In vivo, we found that PAD2 overexpression causes hyperbranching in the developing mammary gland.                Together, these results suggest that PAD2 plays a critical role in breast cancer cell migration. Our findings that EGF treatment increases protein citrullination and that PAD2 inhibition blocks EGF-induced cell migration suggest that PAD2 likely functions within the EGF signaling pathway to mediate cell migration.

24695466        	Adenovirus-mediated efficient gene transfer into cultured three-dimensional organoids.            	Three-dimensional organoids have been recently established from various tissue-specific progenitors (such as intestinal stem cells), induced pluripotent stem cells, or embryonic stem cells. These cultured self-sustaining stem cell-based organoids may become valuable systems to study the roles of tissue-specific stem cells in tissue genesis and disease development. It is thus conceivable that effective genetic manipulations in such organoids may allow us to reconstruct disease processes and/or develop novel therapeutics. Recombinant adenoviruses are one of the most commonly used viral vectors for in vitro and in vivo gene deliveries. In this study, we investigate if adenoviruses can be used to effectively deliver transgenes into the cultured "mini-gut" organoids derived from intestinal stem cells. Using adenoviral vectors that express fluorescent proteins, we demonstrate that adenoviruses can effectively deliver transgenes into the cultured 3-D "mini-gut" organoids. The transgene expression can last at least 10 days in the cultured organoids. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated noggin expression effectively support the survival and self-renewal of mini-gut organoids, while adenovirus-mediated expression of BMP4 inhibits the self-sustainability and proliferation of the organoids. Thus, our results strongly suggest that adenovirus vectors can be explored as effective gene delivery vehicles to introduce genetic manipulations in 3-D organoids.

32234056        	CRISPRi-based radiation modifier screen identifies long non-coding RNA therapeutic targets in glioma.            	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit highly cell type-specific expression and function, making this class of transcript attractive for targeted cancer therapy. However, the vast majority of lncRNAs have not been tested as potential therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of currently used cancer treatments. Malignant glioma is rapidly fatal, and ionizing radiation is part of the current standard-of-care used to slow tumor growth in both adult and pediatric patients.                We use CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to screen 5689 lncRNA loci in human glioblastoma (GBM) cells, identifying 467 hits that modify cell growth in the presence of clinically relevant doses of fractionated radiation. Thirty-three of these lncRNA hits sensitize cells to radiation, and based on their expression in adult and pediatric gliomas, nine of these hits are prioritized as lncRNA Glioma Radiation Sensitizers (lncGRS). Knockdown of lncGRS-1, a primate-conserved, nuclear-enriched lncRNA, inhibits the growth and proliferation of primary adult and pediatric glioma cells, but not the viability of normal brain cells. Using human brain organoids comprised of mature neural cell types as a three-dimensional tissue substrate to model the invasive growth of glioma, we find that antisense oligonucleotides targeting lncGRS-1 selectively decrease tumor growth and sensitize glioma cells to radiation therapy.                These studies identify lncGRS-1 as a glioma-specific therapeutic target and establish a generalizable approach to rapidly identify novel therapeutic targets in the vast non-coding genome to enhance radiation therapy.

32586342        	Wnt-driven LARGE2 mediates laminin-adhesive O-glycosylation in human colonic epithelial cells and colorectal cancer.            	Wnt signaling drives epithelial self-renewal and disease progression in human colonic epithelium and colorectal cancer (CRC). Characterization of Wnt effector pathways is key for our understanding of these processes and for developing therapeutic strategies that aim to preserve tissue homeostasis. O-glycosylated cell surface proteins, such as α-dystroglycan (α-DG), mediate cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix components. We revealed a Wnt/LARGE2/α-DG signaling pathway which triggers this mode of colonic epithelial cell-to-matrix interaction in health and disease.                Next generation sequencing upon shRNA-mediated silencing of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) combined with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transcription factor binding site targeting characterized LARGE2 as a Wnt target gene. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis on size-fractionated, glycoprotein-enriched samples revealed functional O-glycosylation of α-DG by LARGE2 in CRC. The biology of Wnt/LARGE2/α-DG signaling was assessed by affinity-based glycoprotein enrichment, laminin overlay, CRC-to-endothelial cell adhesion, and transwell migration assays. Experiments on primary tissue, human colonic (tumor) organoids, and bioinformatic analysis of CRC cohort data confirmed the biological relevance of our findings.                Next generation sequencing identified the LARGE2 O-glycosyltransferase encoding gene as differentially expressed upon Wnt activation in CRC. Silencing of APC, conditional expression of oncogenic β-catenin and endogenous β-catenin-sequestration affected LARGE2 expression. The first intron of LARGE2 contained a CTTTGATC motif essential for Wnt-driven LARGE2 expression, showed occupation by the Wnt transcription factor TCF7L2, and Wnt activation triggered LARGE2-dependent α-DG O-glycosylation and laminin-adhesion in CRC cells. Colonic crypts and organoids expressed LARGE2 mainly in stem cell-enriched subpopulations. In human adenoma organoids, activity of the LARGE2/α-DG axis was Wnt-dose dependent. LARGE2 expression was elevated in CRC and correlated with the Wnt-driven molecular subtype and intestinal stem cell features. O-glycosylated α-DG represented a Wnt/LARGE2-dependent feature in CRC cell lines and patient-derived tumor organoids. Modulation of LARGE2/α-DG signaling affected CRC cell migration through laminin-coated membranes and adhesion to endothelial cells.                We conclude that the LARGE2 O-glycosyltransferase-encoding gene represents a direct target of canonical Wnt signaling and mediates functional O-glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) in human colonic stem/progenitor cells and Wnt-driven CRC. Our work implies that aberrant Wnt activation augments CRC cell-matrix adhesion by increasing LARGE/α-DG-mediated laminin-adhesiveness. Video abstract.	
26935695        	High-fat diet enhances stemness and tumorigenicity of intestinal progenitors.            	Little is known about how pro-obesity diets regulate tissue stem and progenitor cell function. Here we show that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity augments the numbers and function of Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells of the mammalian intestine. Mechanistically, a HFD induces a robust peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-δ) signature in intestinal stem cells and progenitor cells (non-intestinal stem cells), and pharmacological activation of PPAR-δ recapitulates the effects of a HFD on these cells. Like a HFD, ex vivo treatment of intestinal organoid cultures with fatty acid constituents of the HFD enhances the self-renewal potential of these organoid bodies in a PPAR-δ-dependent manner. Notably, HFD- and agonist-activated PPAR-δ signalling endow organoid-initiating capacity to progenitors, and enforced PPAR-δ signalling permits these progenitors to form in vivo tumours after loss of the tumour suppressor Apc. These findings highlight how diet-modulated PPAR-δ activation alters not only the function of intestinal stem and progenitor cells, but also their capacity to initiate tumours.

29964038        	Vitamin D Regulation of the Uridine Phosphorylase 1 Gene and Uridine-Induced DNA Damage in Colon in African Americans and European Americans.            	African Americans have the greatest colorectal cancer (CRC) burden in the United States; interethnic differences in protective effects of vitamin D might contribute to disparities. 1α,25(OH)2D3 vitamin D (the active form of vitamin D) induces transcription of the uridine phosphorylase gene (UPP1) in colon tissues of European Americans but to a lesser extent in colon tissues of African Americans. UPP1-knockout mice have increased intestinal concentrations of uridine and Deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), have increased uridine-induced DNA damage, and develop colon tumors. We studied 1α,25(OH)2D3 regulation of UPP1 and uridine-induced DNA damage in the colon and differences in these processes between African and European Americans.                We quantified expression and activity of UPP1 in response to 1α,25(OH)2D3 in young adult mouse colonic cells, human CRC cells (LS174T), and organoids (derived from rectosigmoid biopsy samples of healthy individuals undergoing colonoscopies) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and immunocytochemistry assays. Binding of the vitamin D receptor to UPP1 was tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Uridine-induced DNA damage was measured by fragment-length analysis in repair enzyme assays. Allele-specific 1α,25(OH)2D3 responses were tested using luciferase assays.                Vitamin D increased levels of UPP1 mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity and increased vitamin D receptor binding to the UPP1 promoter in young adult mouse colonic cells, LS174T cells, and organoids. 1α,25(OH)2D3 significantly reduced levels of uridine and uridine-induced DNA damage in these cells, which required UPP1 expression. Organoids derived from colon tissues of African Americans expressed lower levels of UPP1 after exposure to 1α,25(OH)2D3 and had increased uridine-induced DNA damage compared with organoids derived from tissues of European Americans. Luciferase assays with the T allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs28605337 near UPP1, which is found more frequently in African Americans than European Americans, expressed lower levels of UPP1 after exposure to 1α,25(OH)2D3 than assays without this variant.                We found vitamin D to increase expression of UPP1, leading to reduce uridine-induced DNA damage, in colon cells and organoids. A polymorphism in UPP1 found more frequently in African Americans than European Americans reduced UPP1 expression upon cell exposure to 1α,25(OH)2D3. Differences in expression of UPP1 in response to vitamin D could contribute to the increased risk of CRC in African Americans.                Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

33617523        	Rapid 3D phenotypic analysis of neurons and organoids using data-driven cell segmentation-free machine learning.            	Phenotypic profiling of large three-dimensional microscopy data sets has not been widely adopted due to the challenges posed by cell segmentation and feature selection. The computational demands of automated processing further limit analysis of hard-to-segment images such as of neurons and organoids. Here we describe a comprehensive shallow-learning framework for automated quantitative phenotyping of three-dimensional (3D) image data using unsupervised data-driven voxel-based feature learning, which enables computationally facile classification, clustering and advanced data visualization. We demonstrate the analysis potential on complex 3D images by investigating the phenotypic alterations of: neurons in response to apoptosis-inducing treatments and morphogenesis for oncogene-expressing human mammary gland acinar organoids. Our novel implementation of image analysis algorithms called Phindr3D allowed rapid implementation of data-driven voxel-based feature learning into 3D high content analysis (HCA) operations and constitutes a major practical advance as the computed assignments represent the biology while preserving the heterogeneity of the underlying data. Phindr3D is provided as Matlab code and as a stand-alone program (https://github.com/DWALab/Phindr3D).	
26414675        	Mouse models of intestinal cancer.            	Murine models of intestinal cancer are powerful tools to recapitulate human intestinal cancer, understand its biology and test therapies. With recent developments identifying the importance of the tumour microenvironment and the potential for immunotherapy, autochthonous genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) will remain an important part of preclinical studies for the foreseeable future. This review will provide an overview of the current mouse models of intestinal cancer, from the Apc(Min/+) mouse, which has been used for over 25 years, to the latest 'state-of-the-art' organoid models. We discuss here how these models have been used to define fundamental processes involved in tumour initiation and the attempts to generate metastatic models, which is the ultimate cause of cancer mortality. Together these models will provide key insights to understand this complex disease and hopefully will lead to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.                © 2015 The Authors.

30742264        	3D Cell Culture Models of Epithelial Tissues.            	Cells in tissues in vivo face a very different microenvironment than typical cultured cells plated on a plastic dish. Already several decades ago, cell biologists observed that cell lines show dramatically different morphology and growth characteristics when embedded into three-dimensional (3D) substrates or standard tissue culture plates (Montesano R, Schaller G, Orci L, Cell. 66:697-711, 1991; Barcellos-Hoff MH, Aggeler J, Ram TG, Bissell MJ, Development. 105:223-235, 1989; Simian M, Bissell MJ, J Cell Biol. 216:31-40, 2017). Despite its imminent benefit for cell biological studies, suspicion and prejudice toward more complicated sample preparation requirements limited the popularity of 3D culture techniques until recently, when it was shown that soft 3D gels made of basement membrane extracts (BME) allow prolonged culture of many types of primary epithelial cells (Clevers H, Cell. 165:1586-1597, 2016; Sato T, Vries RG, Snippert HJ, van de Wetering M, Barker N, Stange DE, et al., Nature. 459:262-265, 2009). These observations have brought 3D organoid culture systems into the mainstream. Here we describe two protocols for culturing epithelial cells in 3D substrates, the "blob culture" setup where cells are fully embedded into BME gel and the "overlay setup" where cells are seeded on top of BME gel and then overlaid with a thin layer of BME (Debnath J, Brugge JS, Nat Rev Cancer. 5:675-688, 2005; Bryant DM, Datta A, Rodriguez-Fraticelli AE, Peranen J, Martin-Belmonte F, Mostov KE, Nat Cell Biol. 12:1035-1045, 2010).

32928922        	Genomic and Epigenomic Landscaping Defines New Therapeutic Targets for Adenosquamous Carcinoma of the Pancreas.            	Adenosquamous cancer of the pancreas (ASCP) is a subtype of pancreatic cancer that has a worse prognosis and greater metastatic potential than the more common pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subtype. To distinguish the genomic landscape of ASCP and identify actionable targets for this lethal cancer, we applied DNA content flow cytometry to a series of 15 tumor samples including five patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We interrogated purified sorted tumor fractions from these samples with whole-genome copy-number variant (CNV), whole-exome sequencing, and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses. These identified a variety of somatic genomic lesions targeting chromatin regulators in ASCP genomes that were superimposed on well-characterized genomic lesions including mutations in TP53 (87%) and KRAS (73%), amplification of MYC (47%), and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (40%) that are common in PDACs. Furthermore, a comparison of ATAC-seq profiles of three ASCP and three PDAC genomes using flow-sorted PDX models identified genes with accessible chromatin unique to the ASCP genomes, including the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2 and the pancreatic cancer stem cell regulator RORC in all three ASCPs, and a FGFR1-ERLIN2 fusion associated with focal CNVs in both genes in a single ASCP. Finally, we demonstrate significant activity of a pan FGFR inhibitor against organoids derived from the FGFR1-ERLIN2 fusion-positive ASCP PDX model. Our results suggest that the genomic and epigenomic landscape of ASCP provide new strategies for targeting this aggressive subtype of pancreatic cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These data provide a unique description of the ASCP genomic and epigenomic landscape and identify candidate therapeutic targets for this dismal cancer.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

24410727        	Calcified scleral choristoma in organoid nevus syndrome simulating retinoblastoma.            	A child referred for management of retinoblastoma who alternatively had a calcified scleral choristoma as part of previously undiagnosed organoid nevus syndrome is described. A 31-month-old male infant with scalp alopecia was referred for retinoblastoma management after a calcified mass in his left eye was found. Ophthalmic examination revealed the mass was of choroidal or scleral origin, underlying the retina. The amelanotic circumpapillary mass extended superonasally in a geographic configuration and measured 14×12 mm. There was no subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, feeder vessels, or tumor seeding. Ocular ultrasonography confirmed a homogeneous calcified intraocular mass 3.1 mm in thickness. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography revealed that the lesion was located within the sclera compressing the overlying choroidal tissue. Further evaluation disclosed cutaneous aplasia cutis congenita with nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed an arachnoid cyst of the brain. Later, optical coherence tomography revealed the mass to be in the deep choroid or within the sclera. This constellation of ocular, cutaneous, and neurological features were suggestive of organoid nevus syndrome. At the 2-year follow-up, the findings were stable. The calcified choristoma of organoid nevus syndrome, located within the sclera in this case, has distinctive clinical features that differentiate this benign tumor from retinoblastoma.

27058937        	Dclk1 Defines Quiescent Pancreatic Progenitors that Promote Injury-Induced Regeneration and Tumorigenesis.            	The existence of adult pancreatic progenitor cells has been debated. While some favor the concept of facultative progenitors involved in homeostasis and repair, neither a location nor markers for such cells have been defined. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that Doublecortin-like kinase-1 (Dclk1) labels a rare population of long-lived, quiescent pancreatic cells. In vitro, Dclk1+ cells proliferate readily and sustain pancreatic organoid growth. In vivo, Dclk1+ cells are necessary for pancreatic regeneration following injury and chronic inflammation. Accordingly, their loss has detrimental effects after cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Expression of mutant Kras in Dclk1+ cells does not affect their quiescence or longevity. However, experimental pancreatitis converts Kras mutant Dclk1+ cells into potent cancer-initiating cells. As a potential effector of Kras, Dclk1 contributes functionally to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these observations indicate that Dclk1 marks quiescent pancreatic progenitors that are candidates for the origin of pancreatic cancer.                Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

30753336        	Kras-driven heterotopic tumor development from hepatobiliary organoids.            	Cancers arising from the biliary tract are refractory to conventional therapies, requiring the development of novel therapeutics. However, only a limited number of genetically engineered mouse models have been created, partly due to time-consuming work required. Besides, liver-specific gene manipulation mostly resulted in concurrent development of hepatocellular carcinoma, another type of liver cancer, and gall bladder-restricted gene targeting is still not feasible. Consequently, establishment of cancer type-specific disease modeling remains a technical challenge. To address this issue, we took an alternative cell-based approach to quickly induce tumorigenesis ex vivo. Specifically, murine primary organoids from liver and gall bladder were transduced with lentiviral vectors to reconstitute genetic alterations common in biliary tract cancers, followed by inoculation in immunodeficient mice. Whereas any single genetic alteration did not induce tumors, mutant Kras and repression of major tumor suppressors cooperated for tumor development within two months. Induced lesions varied among normal, dysplastic and papillary lesions to adenocarcinoma, recapitulating multi-step tumorigenesis even in a heterotopic situation. We further demonstrated that two putative oncogenes in intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma, mutant Pik3ca and FGFR2-AHCYL1 fusion, were rather modest drivers for liver-derived organoids, probably requiring additional mutations or hepatic niche to robustly induce full-blown tumors. Thus, we showed that cancer cells could be readily generated from primary cells in the biliary tract, at least in cases where genetic factors play dominant roles. Collectively, the present study will likely contribute to gaining mechanistic insights into biliary carcinogenesis and providing valuable resources for drug discovery.	
27157623        	Suppression of intestinal tumors by targeting the mitotic spindle of intestinal stem cells.            	Human colorectal cancer is often initiated by the aberrant activation of Wnt signaling, notably following adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) inactivation. Recent studies identified adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and demonstrated their role as the cells of origin for intestinal tumors. However, the early consequences of aberrant Wnt signaling activation remain to be fully elucidated. Here, using organoid cultures established from conditional knockout mice and in vitro gene ablation, we show that Apc inactivation led to aberrant ISC proliferation and the expansion of the crypt domain. This system was used to evaluate the potential of a cancer-related spindle protein, Tacc3, as a target of cancer therapy, as its disruption led to the suppression of tumor formation in an animal model of intestinal tumors. We found that Tacc3 is required for the proper mitosis of Apc-deficient ISCs, and its disruption significantly attenuated the expansion of the crypt domain. In vivo analysis of corresponding mutant mice demonstrated that Tacc3 disruption led to a significant decrease in tumor number and prolonged survival. These observations demonstrated that Tacc3 is a potential chemotherapeutic target for intestinal tumors by perturbing the aberrant cell proliferation of Apc-deficient ISCs and provides an opportunity for the development of novel cancer prevention and treatment.	
30794774        	FXR Regulates Intestinal Cancer Stem Cell Proliferation.            	Increased levels of intestinal bile acids (BAs) are a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we show that the convergence of dietary factors (high-fat diet) and dysregulated WNT signaling (APC mutation) alters BA profiles to drive malignant transformations in Lgr5-expressing (Lgr5+) cancer stem cells and promote an adenoma-to-adenocarcinoma progression. Mechanistically, we show that BAs that antagonize intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) function, including tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-βMCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA), induce proliferation and DNA damage in Lgr5+ cells. Conversely, selective activation of intestinal FXR can restrict abnormal Lgr5+ cell growth and curtail CRC progression. This unexpected role for FXR in coordinating intestinal self-renewal with BA levels implicates FXR as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

31744820        	Mevalonate Pathway Provides Ubiquinone to Maintain Pyrimidine Synthesis and Survival in p53-Deficient Cancer Cells Exposed to Metabolic Stress.            	Oncogene activation and loss of tumor suppressor function changes the metabolic activity of cancer cells to drive unrestricted proliferation. Moreover, cancer cells adapt their metabolism to sustain growth and survival when access to oxygen and nutrients is restricted, such as in poorly vascularized tumor areas. We show here that p53-deficient colon cancer cells exposed to tumor-like metabolic stress in spheroid culture activated the mevalonate pathway to promote the synthesis of ubiquinone. This was essential to maintain mitochondrial electron transport for respiration and pyrimidine synthesis in metabolically compromised environments. Induction of mevalonate pathway enzyme expression in the absence of p53 was mediated by accumulation and stabilization of mature SREBP2. Mevalonate pathway inhibition by statins blocked pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis and induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cells in spheroid culture. Moreover, ubiquinone produced by the mevalonate pathway was essential for the growth of p53-deficient tumor organoids. In contrast, inhibition of intestinal hyperproliferation by statins in an Apc/KrasG12D-mutant mouse model was independent of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of the mevalonate pathway for maintaining mitochondrial electron transfer and biosynthetic activity in cancer cells exposed to metabolic stress. They also demonstrate that the metabolic output of this pathway depends on both genetic and environmental context. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that p53-deficient cancer cells activate the mevalonate pathway via SREBP2 and promote the synthesis of ubiquinone that plays an essential role in reducing oxidative stress and supports the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotide.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32033746        	Deoxycholic acid-stimulated macrophage-derived exosomes promote spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia in the stomach.            	Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) is an important risk factor for the occurrence of gastric cancer. It may be driven by a chronic inflammatory environment in which macrophage is involved. Studies have shown that intestinal metaplasia may originate from SPEM, and bile acid-induced chronic inflammation plays an important role in the process of intestinal metaplasia. However, whether bile acids are involved in the development of SPEM and the specific mechanism are unclear. Meanwhile, macrophages are known to be involved in inflammation regulation by releasing various factors, including exosomes. In this study, we hypothesized that the exosomes released from macrophages stimulated by deoxycholic acid participated in the development of SPME.                In vivo, mice were gavaged with deoxycholic acid for 4 weeks, and gastric tissues were harvested. In vitro, deoxycholic acid-induced macrophage-derived exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and cocultured with the gastric organoids of mice. Immunofluorescence staining and quantitative real-time PCR were used to analyze markers of macrophages and SPEM.                In vivo, after 4 weeks of deoxycholic acid intragastric administration, macrophage markers (F4/80) and SPEM markers (TFF2 and GSII lectin) were increased in from treated mice compared with those from normal control mice. In vitro, macrophage-derived exosomes labeled with PKH67 were internalized by gastric organoids. Deoxycholic acid-induced macrophage-derived exosomes increased the expression of SPEM markers (TFF2 and GSII lectin) in gastric organoids compared to exosomes derived from macrophages without deoxycholic acid stimulation.                Macrophage-derived exosomes may be a novel mechanism by which deoxycholic acid promotes SPEM.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
32188134        	Recent Advances in Practical Methods for Liver Cell Biology: A Short Overview.            	Molecular and cellular research modalities for the study of liver pathologies have been tremendously improved over the recent decades. Advanced technologies offer novel opportunities to establish cell isolation techniques with excellent purity, paving the path for 2D and 3D microscopy and high-throughput assays (e.g., bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing). The use of stem cell and organoid research will help to decipher the pathophysiology of liver diseases and the interaction between various parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells. Furthermore, sophisticated animal models of liver disease allow for the in vivo assessment of fibrogenesis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and for the preclinical testing of therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this review is to portray in detail novel in vitro and in vivo methods for the study of liver cell biology that had been presented at the workshop of the 8th meeting of the European Club for Liver Cell Biology (ECLCB-8) in October of 2018 in Bonn, Germany.	
32298392        	Comparing the intra-tumoral distribution of Gemcitabine, 5-Fluorouracil, and Capecitabine in a murine model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.            	To develop a technique to compare the intra-tumoral distribution of the drug gemcitabine, its surrogate [18F]-fluoroarabinocytosine ([18F]-FAC) and related chemotherapeutics 5-FU and capecitabine in a pre-clinical model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).                Using a KPC-organoid derived model of PDAC, we obtained autoradiographic images of the tumor distribution of, [14C]-gemcitabine, [14C]-5-FU, [3H]-capecitabine. These were compared indirectly by co-administering [18F]-FAC, a close analog of gemcitabine with a proven equivalent intra-tumor distribution. The short half-life of 18F allows for clean separation of 3H/14C labeled drugs in specimens by dual isotope digital autoradiography. Autoradiographic images of [14C]-gemcitabine, [3H]-capecitabine and [14C]-5-FU were each correlated to [18F]-FAC on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The tumor drug penetration was compared using cumulative histograms.                Gemcitabine distribution correlated strongly with FAC as expected. 5-FU also gave a similar microdistribution to that of FAC, whereas no correlation was found between capecitabine or its metabolic products and FAC distribution. Accumulation of Gemcitabine and 5-FU was lower in hypoxic regions of the tumor, whereas no such correlation was observed for capecitabine and its metabolites.                Gemcitabine and 5-FU target the same regions of the tumor, leaving hypoxic cells untreated. Capecitabine metabolites penetrate further into the tumor but it is yet to be determined whether these metabolites are the active form of the drug.

Epigenetic regulators are attractive anticancer targets, but the promise of therapeutic strategies inhibiting some of these factors has not been proven in vivo or taken into account tumor cell heterogeneity. Here we show that the histone methyltransferase G9a, reported to be a therapeutic target in many cancers, is a suppressor of aggressive lung tumor-propagating cells (TPCs). Inhibition of G9a drives lung adenocarcinoma cells towards the TPC phenotype by de-repressing genes which regulate the extracellular matrix. Depletion of G9a during tumorigenesis enriches tumors in TPCs and accelerates disease progression metastasis. Depleting histone demethylases represses G9a-regulated genes and TPC phenotypes. Demethylase inhibition impairs lung adenocarcinoma progression in vivo. Therefore, inhibition of G9a is dangerous in certain cancer contexts, and targeting the histone demethylases is a more suitable approach for lung cancer treatment. Understanding cellular context and specific tumor populations is critical when targeting epigenetic regulators in cancer for future therapeutic development.	
32665357        	The Synthetic Small Molecule FL3 Combats Intestinal Tumorigenesis via Axin1-Mediated Inhibition of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling.            	Colorectal cancer exhibits aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Many inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway have been tested for Wnt-dependent cancers including colorectal cancer, but are unsuccessful due to severe adverse reactions. FL3 is a synthetic derivative of natural products called flavaglines, which exhibit anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties in intestinal epithelial cells, but has not been previously tested in cell or preclinical models of intestinal tumorigenesis. In vitro studies suggest that flavaglines target prohibitin 1 (PHB1) as a ligand, but this has not been established in the intestine. PHB1 is a highly conserved protein with diverse functions that depend on its posttranslational modifications and subcellular localization. Here, we demonstrate that FL3 combats intestinal tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane-dextran sodium sulfate and ApcMin/+ mouse models and in human colorectal cancer tumor organoids (tumoroids) by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling via induction of Axin1 expression. FL3 exhibited no change in cell viability in normal intestinal epithelial cells or human matched-normal colonoids. FL3 response was diminished in colorectal cancer cell lines and human colorectal cancer tumoroids harboring a mutation at S45 of β-catenin. PHB1 deficiency in mice or in human colorectal cancer tumoroids abolished FL3-induced expression of Axin1 and drove tumoroid death. In colorectal cancer cells, FL3 treatment blocked phosphorylation of PHB1 at Thr258, resulting in its nuclear translocation and binding to the Axin1 promoter. These results suggest that FL3 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling via PHB1-dependent activation of Axin1. FL3, therefore, represents a novel compound that combats Wnt pathway-dependent cancers, such as colorectal cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting of PHB1 by FL3 provides a novel mechanism to combat Wnt-driven cancers, with limited intestinal toxicity.

30779944        	MIR-1265 regulates cellular proliferation and apoptosis by targeting calcium binding protein 39 in gastric cancer and, thereby, impairing oncogenic autophagy.            	Increasing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in various tumors by regulating downstream target genes and diverse signaling pathways. Herein, we confirmed miR-1265 expression in gastric cancer (GC) using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and assessed the level of miR-1265 expression in clinical specimens and cell lines. We found that miR-1265 expression was negatively correlated with tumor size. Further functional analysis revealed that miR-1265 suppresses cellular proliferation and autophagy while inducing apoptosis in GC cells. A luciferase reporter assay was used to identify an miR-1265 targeted gene, calcium binding protein 39 (CAB39), which is an essential upstream regulator in the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. Upregulation or downregulation of CAB39 expression reversed the effects of miR-1265 overexpression or inhibition, respectively. Notably, the knockdown of autophagy-related gene 12 (ATG12) impaired the effects of miR-1265 inhibition or CAB39 overexpression in GC. MiR-1265 also suppressed the growth of GC cells in vivo and that of human gastric organoids. Altogether, our results show that miR-1265 suppresses GC progression and oncogenic autophagy by reducing CAB39 expression and regulating the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, miR-1265 may represent a potential therapeutic target for GC.                Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
31241371        	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new drugs for pancreatic cancer.            	Introduction: Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a disease with a dismal prognosis. Despite accounting for only 3% of cancer diagnosis, 7% of all cancer deaths in the United States are from PC. This is explained by many being diagnosed with late-stage disease and the cancer's resistance to chemotherapy. Since 1996 there have only been two upfront regimens found to be superior to gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Areas covered: Clinical pharmacology of newer agents that are either approved or being investigated in the management of PC. Knowledge of their pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics can be used to predict outcomes for specific patient populations. Drugs discussed include nanoliposomal irinotecan, pegvorhyaluronidase alfa, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme inhibitors, larotrectinib, and napabucasin. Expert opinion: PC is a heterogeneous disease and outcomes are likely to improve as better predictive models of an individual's response to different therapies are developed. This may be best accomplished through phase 0 studies and the use of tumor organoid models grown from initial biopsies or resected tissue. The genetic and physical makeup of the tumor as well as the functional characterization in patient-derived organoids (PDOs), can help guide which agents may be most efficacious or toxic.	
32250351        	Multidimensional Coculture System to Model Lung Squamous Carcinoma Progression.            	Tumor-stroma interactions play a critical role in the development of lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC). However, understanding how these dynamic interactions contribute to tissue architectural changes observed during tumorigenesis remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate models. In this protocol, we describe the generation of a 3D coculture model using a LUSC primary cell culture known as TUM622. TUM622 cells were established from a LUSC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and have the unique property to form acinar-like structures when seeded in a basement membrane matrix. We demonstrate that TUM622 acini in 3D coculture recapitulate key features of tissue architecture during LUSC progression as well as the dynamic interactions between LUSC cells and components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We further adapt our principal 3D culturing protocol to demonstrate how this system could be utilized for various downstream analyses. Overall, this organoid model creates a biologically rich and adaptable platform that enables one to gain insight into the cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that promote the disruption of epithelial architectures during carcinoma progression and will aid the search for new therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers.	
31947947        	Mitochondrial Fusion Via OPA1 and MFN1 Supports Liver Tumor Cell Metabolism and Growth.            	Metabolic reprogramming universally occurs in cancer. Mitochondria act as the hubs of bioenergetics and metabolism. The morphodynamics of mitochondria, comprised of fusion and fission processes, are closely associated with mitochondrial functions and are often dysregulated in cancer. In this study, we aim to investigate the mitochondrial morphodynamics and its functional consequences in human liver cancer. We observed excessive activation of mitochondrial fusion in tumor tissues from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and in vitro cultured tumor organoids from cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The knockdown of the fusion regulator genes, OPA1 (Optic atrophy 1) or MFN1 (Mitofusin 1), inhibited the fusion process in HCC cell lines and CCA tumor organoids. This resulted in inhibition of cell growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo, after tumor cell engraftment in mice. This inhibitory effect is associated with the induction of cell apoptosis, but not related to cell cycle arrest. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiling revealed that the inhibition of fusion predominately affected cellular metabolic pathways. This was further confirmed by the blocking of mitochondrial fusion which attenuated oxygen consumption and cellular ATP production of tumor cells. In conclusion, increased mitochondrial fusion in liver cancer alters metabolism and fuels tumor cell growth.	
33423358        	KHDRBS3 promotes multi-drug resistance and anchorage-independent growth in colorectal cancer.            	5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most frequently used pharmacological agents in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Resistance to chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure of CRC, and it is a well known fact that cancer stem cells play a significant role in the acquisition of drug resistance. In this study, we focused on the KHDRBS3 gene that encodes KH RNA Binding Domain Containing, Signal Transduction Associated 3. We first clarified the relationship between KHDRBS3 and 5-FU resistance. We then observed higher expression levels of KHDRBS3 in KRAS-mutant organoids and cell lines in comparison with KRAS wild-type organoids and cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis using CRC cases revealed that the prognosis of KHDRBS3-positive patients was significantly worse compared with that of KHDRBS3-negative patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that KHDRBS3 was an independent prognostic factor in patients with CRC. We determined that KHDRBS3 might play a crucial role in the acquisition of stem cell properties, such as drug resistance and spheroid/organoid formation, by regulating CD44 variant expression and the Wnt signaling pathway. In an immunodeficient mouse model, KHDRBS3-positive cells showed efficient tumor formation and formed metastatic lesions in the lungs. These results indicated that KHDRBS3 plays a crucial role in drug resistance and anchorage-independent growth by maintaining stem cell-like features in CRC cells. KHDRBS3 could be a promising candidate marker for predicting chemotherapeutic effect and prognosis in CRC patients.                © 2021 The Authors.

31759926        	HNF4 Regulates Fatty Acid Oxidation and Is Required for Renewal of Intestinal Stem Cells in Mice.            	Functions of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are regulated by diet and metabolic pathways. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) family are transcription factors that bind fatty acids. We investigated how HNF4 transcription factors regulate metabolism and their functions in ISCs in mice.                We performed studies with Villin-CreERT2;Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2;Hnf4αf/f;Hnf4γCrispr/Crispr mice, hereafter referred to Hnf4αγDKO. Mice were given tamoxifen to induce Cre recombinase. Mice transgenic with only Cre alleles (Villin-CreERT2, Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2, Hnf4α+/+, and Hnf4γ+/+) or mice given vehicle were used as controls. Crypt and villus cells were isolated, incubated with fluorescently labeled fatty acids or glucose analog, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Fatty acid oxidation activity and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites were measured in cells collected from the proximal half of the small intestine of Hnf4αγDKO and control mice. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling analyses to identify genes regulated by HNF4 factors. We established organoids from duodenal crypts, incubated them with labeled palmitate or acetate, and measured production of TCA cycle metabolites or fatty acids. Acetate, a precursor of acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) (a product of fatty acid β-oxidation [FAO]), or dichloroacetate, a compound that promotes pyruvate oxidation and generation of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, were used for metabolic intervention.                Crypt cells rapidly absorbed labeled fatty acids, and messenger RNA levels of Lgr5+ stem cell markers (Lgr5, Olfm4, Smoc2, Msi1, and Ascl2) were down-regulated in organoids incubated with etomoxir, an inhibitor of FAO, indicating that FAO was required for renewal of ISCs. HNF4A and HNF4G were expressed in ISCs and throughout the intestinal epithelium. Single knockout of either HNF4A or HNF4G did not affect maintenance of ISCs, but double-knockout of HNF4A and HNF4G resulted in ISC loss; stem cells failed to renew. FAO supports ISC renewal, and HNF4 transcription factors directly activate FAO genes, including Acsl5 and Acsf2 (encode regulators of acyl-CoA synthesis), Slc27a2 (encodes a fatty acid transporter), Fabp2 (encodes fatty acid binding protein), and Hadh (encodes hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase). In the intestinal epithelium of Hnf4αγDKO mice, expression levels of FAO genes, FAO activity, and metabolites of TCA cycle were all significantly decreased, but fatty acid synthesis transcripts were increased, compared with control mice. The contribution of labeled palmitate or acetate to the TCA cycle was reduced in organoids derived from Hnf4αγDKO mice, compared with control mice. Incubation of organoids derived from double-knockout mice with acetate or dichloroacetate restored stem cells.                In mice, the transcription factors HNF4A and HNF4G regulate the expression of genes required for FAO and are required for renewal of ISCs.                Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute.

33375140        	A Review on the Current Knowledge on ZIKV Infection and the Interest of Organoids and Nanotechnology on Development of Effective Therapies against Zika Infection.            	Zika virus (ZIKV) acquired a special relevance due to the pandemic that occurred in the Americas in 2015, when an important number of fetal microcephaly cases occurred. Since then, numerous studies have tried to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and the potential therapeutic approaches to combat the virus. Cellular and animal models have proved to be a basic resource for this research, with the more recent addition of organoids as a more realistic and physiological 3D culture for the study of ZIKV. Nanotechnology can also offer a promising therapeutic tool, as the nanoparticles developed by this field can penetrate cells and deliver a wide array of drugs in a very specific and controlled way inside the cells. These two state-of-the-art scientific tools clearly provide a very relevant resource for the study of ZIKV, and will help researchers find an effective treatment or vaccine against the virus.	
32430853        	Hopea odorata Extract Can Efficiently Kill Breast Cancer Cells and Cancer Stem-Like Cells in Three-Dimensional Culture More Than in Monolayer Cell Culture.            	The breast cancer cells with CD44+CD24- phenotype are known to play an important role in tumorigenesis, drug resistance, and cancer recurrence. Breast cancer cells with CD44+CD24- phenotype are cultured in three-dimensional (3D) stereotype showing the recapitulation of tumors in vivo such as cell differentiation, heterogeneity, and microenvironment. Using this 3D model in anti-cancer compound research results in a more accurate reflection than conventional monolayer cell culture. This study aimed to identify the antitumor activity of Hopea odorata methanol extract (HO-MeOH-E) on breast cancer cells and cancer stem-like cells in both models of three-dimensional culture (3D) and monolayer cell culture (2D).                HO-MeOH-E was produced from Hopea odorata plant. The VN9 breast cancer cells (VN9) were collected and expanded from the previous study. The breast cancer stem-like cells (VN9CSC) were sorted from the VN9 based on phenotype CD44+CD24-. Both VN9 and VN9CSC were used to culture in monolayer culture (2D) and organoids (3D) before they were used to treat with HO-MeOH-E. Two other anticancer drugs, doxorubicin and tirapazamine, were used as references. The antitumor activities of extracts and drugs were determined via two assays: antiproliferation using the Alamar blue assay and cell cycle assay.                The results showed that HO-MeOH-E was sensitive to both VN9 and VN9CSC in 3D more than 2D culture (IC50 on 3D organoids 144.8 ± 2.172 μg/mL and on 2D 340.2 ± 17.01 μg/mL for VN9CSC (p < 0.001); IC50 on 3D organoids 2055 ± 82.2 μg/mL and on 2D 430.6 ± 8.612 μg/mL for VN9 (p < 0.0001), respectively). HO-MeOH-E inhibits VN9CSC proliferation by blocking S phase and increasing the populations of apoptotic cells; this is consensus to the effect of tirapazamine (TPZ) which is used in hypoxia-activated chemotherapy.                Taken these results, HO-MeOH-E has the potential effect in hypoxia-activated chemotherapy specifically on breast cancer stem-like cells with CD44+CD24- phenotype.	
28390865        	SPDEF Induces Quiescence of Colorectal Cancer Cells by Changing the Transcriptional Targets of β-catenin.            	The canonical Wnt signaling pathway activates the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. This pathway is often activated in colorectal cancer cells, but strategies to block it in tumors have not been effective. The SAM pointed domain containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) suppresses formation of colon tumors by unclear mechanisms. We investigated these mechanisms and the effects of SPDEF on β-catenin activity in mouse models of colorectal cancer (CRC), CRC cell lines, and mouse and human normal and cancer colonoids.                We performed studies of Lgr5CreERT2; β-cateninexon3; Rosa26LSL-rtta-ires-EGFP; TRE-Spdef mice, which express an oncogenic form of β-catenin in Lgr5-positive ISCs upon administration of tamoxifen and SPDEF upon administration of tetracycline. CRC lines (HCT116 and SW480) were engineered to express inducible tagged SPDEF or vector (control) and subcutaneously injected into immunodeficient NSG mice. We generated SPDEF-inducible human colonoids, including a line derived from normal rectal mucosa (control) and an adenocarcinoma line derived from a patient with germline MUTYH mutation. Full-length and truncated forms of SPDEF were expressed in CRC cells; cells were assayed for β-catenin activity and studied in immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.                Expression of SPDEF was sufficient to inhibit intestinal tumorigenesis by activated β-catenin, block tumor cell proliferation, and restrict growth of established tumors. In tumor cells with activated β -catenin, expression of SPDEF induced a quiescent state, which was reversed when SPDEF expression was stopped. In mouse and human normal and tumor-derived enteroids/colonoids, those that expressed SPDEF for 3 days were significantly smaller. SPDEF inhibited the transcriptional activity of β-catenin via a protein-protein interaction, independent of SPDEF DNA binding capacity. SPDEF disrupted β-catenin binding to TCF1 and TCF3, displacing β-catenin from enhancer regions of genes that regulate the cell cycle but not genes that regulate stem cell activities.                In studies of mice and human CRC, we found that SPDEF induces a quiescent state in CRC cells by disrupting binding of β-catenin to TCF1 and TCF3 and regulation of genes that control the cell cycle. In this model, β-catenin activity determines the proliferation or quiescence of CRC cells based on the absence or presence of SPDEF.                Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

32029896        	BCAT2-mediated BCAA catabolism is critical for development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.            	Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism is potentially linked with development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)1-4. BCAA transaminase 2 (BCAT2) was essential for the collateral lethality conferred by deletion of malic enzymes in PDAC and the BCAA-BCAT metabolic pathway contributed to non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) other than PDAC3,4. However, the underlying mechanism remains undefined. Here we reveal that BCAT2 is elevated in mouse models and in human PDAC. Furthermore, pancreatic tissue-specific knockout of Bcat2 impedes progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) in LSL-KrasG12D/+; Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice. Functionally, BCAT2 enhances BCAA uptake to sustain BCAA catabolism and mitochondrial respiration. Notably, BCAA enhances growth of pancreatic ductal organoids from KC mice in a dose-dependent manner, whereas addition of branched-chain α-keto acid (BCKA) and nucleobases rescues growth of KC organoids that is suppressed by BCAT2 inhibitor. Moreover, KRAS stabilizes BCAT2, which is mediated by spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and E3 ligase tripartite-motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21). In addition, BCAT2 inhibitor ameliorates PanIN formation in KC mice. Of note, a lower-BCAA diet also impedes PDAC development in mouse models of PDAC. Thus, BCAT2-mediated BCAA catabolism is critical for development of PDAC harbouring KRAS mutations. Targeting BCAT2 or lowering dietary BCAA may have translational significance.	
32882403        	The Gustatory Sensory G-Protein GNAT3 Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer Progression in Mice.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) initiation and progression are accompanied by an immunosuppressive inflammatory response. Here, we evaluated the immunomodulatory role of chemosensory signaling in metaplastic tuft cells (MTCs) by analyzing the role of GNAT3, a gustatory pathway G-protein expressed by MTCs, during PDA progression.                Gnat3-null (Gnat3-/-) mice were crossbred with animals harboring a Cre-inducible KrasLSL-G12D/+ allele with either Ptf1aCre/+ (KC) or tamoxifen-inducible Ptf1aCreERT/+ (KCERT) mice to drive oncogenic KRAS expression in the pancreas. Ex vivo organoid conditioned medium generated from KC and Gnat3-/-;KC acinar cells was analyzed for cytokine secretion. Experimental pancreatitis was induced in KCERT and Gnat3-/-;KCERT mice to accelerate tumorigenesis, followed by analysis using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. To study PDA progression, KC and Gnat3-/-;KC mice were aged to morbidity or 52 weeks.                Ablation of Gnat3 in KC organoids increased release of tumor-promoting cytokines in conditioned media, including CXCL1 and CXCL2. Analysis of Gnat3-/-;KCERT pancreata found altered expression of immunomodulatory genes in Cxcr2 expressing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and an increased number of granulocytic MDSCs, a subset of tumor promoting MDSCs. Importantly, expression levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2, known ligands for CXCR2, were also elevated in Gnat3-/-;KCERT pancreata. Consistent with the tumor-promoting role of MDSCs, aged Gnat3-/-;KC mice progressed more rapidly to metastatic carcinoma compared with KC controls.                Compromised gustatory sensing, achieved by Gnat3 ablation, enhanced the CXCL1/2-CXCR2 axis to alter the MDSC population and promoted the progression of metastatic PDA.

31133056        	Fluorescence-based tracing of transplanted intestinal epithelial cells using confocal laser endomicroscopy.            	Intestinal stem cell transplantation has been shown to promote mucosal healing and to engender fully functional epithelium in experimental colitis. Hence, stem cell therapies may provide an innovative approach to accomplish mucosal healing in patients with debilitating conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. However, an approach to label and trace transplanted cells, in order to assess engraftment efficiency and to monitor wound healing, is a key hurdle to overcome prior to initiating human studies. Genetic engineering is commonly employed in animal studies, but may be problematic in humans due to potential off-target and long-term adverse effects.                We investigated the applicability of a panel of fluorescent dyes and nanoparticles to label intestinal organoids for visualization using the clinically approved imaging modality, confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE). Staining homogeneity, durability, cell viability, differentiation capacity, and organoid forming efficiency were evaluated, together with visualization of labeled organoids in vitro and ex vivo using CLE.                5-Chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) proved to be suitable as it efficiently stained all organoids without transfer to unstained organoids in co-cultures. No noticeable adverse effects on viability, organoid growth, or stem cell differentiation capacity were observed, although single-cell reseeding revealed a dose-dependent reduction in organoid forming efficiency. Labeled organoids were easily identified in vitro using CLE for a duration of at least 3 days and could additionally be detected ex vivo following transplantation into murine experimental colitis.                It is highly feasible to use fluorescent dye-based labeling in combination with CLE to trace intestinal organoids following transplantation to confirm implantation at the intestinal target site.	
28119740        	Establishment of a Novel Model for Anticancer Drug Resistance in Three-Dimensional Primary Culture of Tumor Microenvironment.            	Tumor microenvironment has been implicated in tumor development and progression. As a three-dimensional tumor microenvironment model, air liquid interface (ALI) organoid culture from oncogene transgenic mouse gastrointestinal tissues was recently produced. However, ALI organoid culture system from tissues of colorectal cancer patients has not been established. Here, we developed an ALI organoid model from normal and tumor colorectal tissues of human patients. Both organoids were successfully generated and showed cystic structures containing an epithelial layer and surrounding mesenchymal stromal cells. Structures of tumor organoids closely resembled primary tumor epithelium. Expression of an epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, a goblet cell marker, MUC2, and a fibroblast marker, vimentin, but not a myofibroblast marker, α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), was observed in normal organoids. Expression of E-cadherin, MUC2, vimentin, and α-SMA was observed in tumor organoids. Expression of a cancer stem cell marker, LGR5 in tumor organoids, was higher than that in primary tumor tissues. Tumor organoids were more resistant to toxicity of 5-fluorouracil and Irinotecan than colorectal cancer cell lines, SW480, SW620, and HCT116. These findings indicate that ALI organoid culture from colorectal cancer patients may become a novel model that is useful for examining resistance to chemotherapy in tumor microenvironment.	
33292279        	Intestinal region-specific Wnt signalling profiles reveal interrelation between cell identity and oncogenic pathway activity in cancer development.            	Cancer results from the accumulation of mutations leading to the acquisition of cancer promoting characteristics such as increased proliferation and resistance to cell death. In colorectal cancer, an early mutation leading to such features usually occurs in the APC or CTNNB1 genes, thereby activating Wnt signalling. However, substantial phenotypic differences between cancers originating within the same organ, such as molecular subtypes, are not fully reflected by differences in mutations. Indeed, the phenotype seems to result from a complex interplay between the cell-intrinsic features and the acquired mutations, which is difficult to disentangle when established tumours are studied.                We use a 3D in vitro organoid model to study the early phase of colorectal cancer development. From three different murine intestinal locations we grow organoids. These are transformed to resemble adenomas after Wnt activation through lentiviral transduction with a stable form of β-Catenin. The gene expression before and after Wnt activation is compared within each intestinal origin and across the three locations using RNA sequencing. To validate and generalize our findings, we use gene expression data from patients.                In reaction to Wnt activation we observe downregulation of location specific genes and differentiation markers. A similar effect is seen in patient data, where genes with significant differential expression between the normal left and right colon are downregulated in the cancer samples. Furthermore, the signature of Wnt target genes differs between the three intestinal locations in the organoids. The location specific Wnt signatures are dominated by genes which have been lowly expressed in the tissue of origin, and are the targets of transcription factors that are activated following enhanced Wnt signalling.                We observed that the region-specific cell identity has a substantial effect on the reaction to Wnt activation in a simple intestinal adenoma model. These findings provide a way forward in resolving the distinct biology between left- and right-sided human colon cancers with potential clinical relevance.	
26503053        	Yap-dependent reprogramming of Lgr5(+) stem cells drives intestinal regeneration and cancer.            	The gut epithelium has remarkable self-renewal capacity that under homeostatic conditions is driven by Wnt signalling in Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells (ISCs). However, the mechanisms underlying ISC regeneration after injury remain poorly understood. The Hippo signalling pathway mediates tissue growth and is important for regeneration. Here we demonstrate in mice that Yap, a downstream transcriptional effector of Hippo, is critical for recovery of intestinal epithelium after exposure to ionizing radiation. Yap transiently reprograms Lgr5(+) ISCs by suppressing Wnt signalling and excessive Paneth cell differentiation, while promoting cell survival and inducing a regenerative program that includes Egf pathway activation. Accordingly, growth of Yap-deficient organoids is rescued by the Egfr ligand epiregulin, and we find that non-cell-autonomous production of stromal epiregulin may compensate for Yap loss in vivo. Consistent with key roles for regenerative signalling in tumorigenesis, we further demonstrate that Yap inactivation abolishes adenomas in the Apc(Min) mouse model of colon cancer, and that Yap-driven expansion of Apc(-/-) organoids requires the Egfr module of the Yap regenerative program. Finally, we show that in vivo Yap is required for progression of early Apc mutant tumour-initiating cells, suppresses their differentiation into Paneth cells, and induces a regenerative program and Egfr signalling. Our studies reveal that upon tissue injury, Yap reprograms Lgr5(+) ISCs by inhibiting the Wnt homeostatic program, while inducing a regenerative program that includes activation of Egfr signalling. Moreover, our findings reveal a key role for the Yap regenerative pathway in driving cancer initiation.	GEO                                            GSE66567
27722205        	Modeling Cancer with Pluripotent Stem Cells.            	The elucidation of cancer pathogenesis has been hindered by limited access to patient samples, tumor heterogeneity and the lack of reliable model organisms. Characterized by their ability to self-renew indefinitely and differentiate into all cell lineages of an organism, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), provide a powerful and unlimited source to generate differentiated cells that can be used to study disease biology, facilitate drug discovery and development, and provide key insights for developing personalized therapies. This article reviews the recent developments and technologies converting PSCs into clinically relevant model systems for cancer research.	
28262686        	Lipid-mediated Wnt protein stabilization enables serum-free culture of human organ stem cells.            	Wnt signalling proteins are essential for culture of human organ stem cells in organoids, but most Wnt protein formulations are poorly active in serum-free media. Here we show that purified Wnt3a protein is ineffective because it rapidly loses activity in culture media due to its hydrophobic nature, and its solubilization requires a detergent, CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), that interferes with stem cell self-renewal. By stabilizing the Wnt3a protein using phospholipids and cholesterol as carriers, we address both problems: Wnt activity remains stable in serum-free media, while non-toxic carriers allow the use of high Wnt concentrations. Stabilized Wnt3a supports strongly increased self-renewal of organ and embryonic stem cells and the serum-free establishment of human organoids from healthy and diseased intestine and liver. Moreover, the lipophilicity of Wnt3a protein greatly facilitates its purification. Our findings remove a major obstacle impeding clinical applications of adult stem cells and offer advantages for all cell culture uses of Wnt3a protein.	
29559533        	PDGFRα                    +                 pericryptal stromal cells are the critical source of Wnts and RSPO3 for murine intestinal stem cells in vivo.            	Wnts and R-spondins (RSPOs) support intestinal homeostasis by regulating crypt cell proliferation and differentiation. Ex vivo, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells in organoids can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of Lgr5-expressing intestinal stem cells. However, in vivo, Paneth cell and indeed all epithelial Wnt production is completely dispensable, and the cellular source of Wnts and RSPOs that maintain the intestinal stem-cell niche is not known. Here we investigated both the source and the functional role of stromal Wnts and RSPO3 in regulation of intestinal homeostasis. RSPO3 is highly expressed in pericryptal myofibroblasts in the lamina propria and is several orders of magnitude more potent than RSPO1 in stimulating both Wnt/β-catenin signaling and organoid growth. Stromal Rspo3 ablation ex vivo resulted in markedly decreased organoid growth that was rescued by exogenous RSPO3 protein. Pdgf receptor alpha (PdgfRα) is known to be expressed in pericryptal myofibroblasts. We therefore evaluated if PdgfRα identified the key stromal niche cells. In vivo, Porcn excision in PdgfRα+ cells blocked intestinal crypt formation, demonstrating that Wnt production in the stroma is both necessary and sufficient to support the intestinal stem-cell niche. Mice with Rspo3 excision in the PdgfRα+ cells had decreased intestinal crypt Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Paneth cell differentiation and were hypersensitive when stressed with dextran sodium sulfate. The data support a model of the intestinal stem-cell niche regulated by both Wnts and RSPO3 supplied predominantly by stromal pericryptal myofibroblasts marked by PdgfRα.

29653286        	Stromal cell-laden 3D hydrogel microwell arrays as tumor microenvironment model for studying stiffness dependent stromal cell-cancer interactions.            	Tumor properties such as growth and metastasis are dramatically dependent on the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the diversity of the TME including the stiffness and the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as the involvement of stromal cells, makes it extremely difficult to establish proper in vitro models for studying tumor growth and metastasis. In this research, we fabricated a stromal cell-laden microwell array system with tunable stiffness ranging from 200 Pa up to 3 kPa, which covers the stiffness range of normal and cancerous mammary tissues, to study the effect of ECM stiffness on stromal-cancer interaction. Our results showed that, tumor spheroids closely interacted with the pre-adipocyte stromal cells encapsulated within the microwell array, influencing their differentiation and maturation degree in a stiffness related manner. They inhibited adipogenesis in high stiffness tissue constructs that were at breast cancer stiffness range, while the inhibition effect diminished in the low stiffness tissue constructs that were at normal human breast tissue range. Furthermore, the 3D structure of tumor spheroids was shown to be important for the inhibition of the adipogenesis, as conditioned media from monolayer culture of cancer cells did not show any significant effect. These results show, for the first time in literature, that stromal-cancer interactions are highly dependent on ECM stiffness. The biomimetic TME platform developed here is a powerful organ-specific cancer model for studying the involvement of stromal cells in early mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis, and could be powerful platform for high-throughput drug discovery.

27990460        	The Development of Spasmolytic Polypeptide/TFF2-Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM) During Gastric Repair Is Absent in the Aged Stomach.            	During aging, physiological changes in the stomach result in more tenuous gastric tissue that is less capable of repairing injury, leading to increased susceptibility to chronic ulceration. Spasmolytic polypeptide/trefoil factor 2-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) is known to emerge after parietal cell loss and during Helicobacter pylori infection, however, its role in gastric ulcer repair is unknown. Therefore, we sought to investigate if SPEM plays a role in epithelial regeneration.                Acetic acid ulcers were induced in young (2-3 mo) and aged (18-24 mo) C57BL/6 mice to determine the quality of ulcer repair with advancing age. Yellow chameleon 3.0 mice were used to generate yellow fluorescent protein-expressing organoids for transplantation. Yellow fluorescent protein-positive gastric organoids were transplanted into the submucosa and lumen of the stomach immediately after ulcer induction. Gastric tissue was collected and analyzed to determine the engraftment of organoid-derived cells within the regenerating epithelium.                Wound healing in young mice coincided with the emergence of SPEM within the ulcerated region, a response that was absent in the aged stomach. Although aged mice showed less metaplasia surrounding the ulcerated tissue, organoid-transplanted aged mice showed regenerated gastric glands containing organoid-derived cells. Organoid transplantation in the aged mice led to the emergence of SPEM and gastric regeneration.                These data show the development of SPEM during gastric repair in response to injury that is absent in the aged stomach. In addition, gastric organoids in an injury/transplantation mouse model promoted gastric regeneration.	
33105193        	Optimization of Pancreatic Juice Collection: A First Step Toward Biomarker Discovery and Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer.            	Imaging-based surveillance programs fail to detect pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at a curable stage, creating an urgent need for diagnostic biomarkers.                Secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice (PJ) was collected from the duodenal lumen during endoscopic ultrasound. The yield of biomarkers and organoids was compared for 2 collection techniques (endoscope suction channel vs catheter-based) and 3 periods (0-4 vs 4-8 vs 8-15 minutes).                Collection through the endoscope suction channel was superior to collection with a catheter. Collection beyond 8 minutes reduced biomarker yield. PJ-derived organoid culture was feasible.                The optimal protocol for secretin-stimulated PJ collection is through the endoscope suction channel for 8 minutes allowing biomarker detection and organoid culture.	
31796516        	Significance of BRCA2 and RB1 Co-loss in Aggressive Prostate Cancer Progression.            	Previous sequencing studies revealed that alterations of genes associated with DNA damage response (DDR) are enriched in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). BRCA2, a DDR and cancer susceptibility gene, is frequently deleted (homozygous and heterozygous) in men with aggressive prostate cancer. Here we show that patients with prostate cancer who have lost a copy of BRCA2 frequently lose a copy of tumor suppressor gene RB1; importantly, for the first time, we demonstrate that co-loss of both genes in early prostate cancer is sufficient to induce a distinct biology that is likely associated with worse prognosis.                We prospectively investigated underlying molecular mechanisms and genomic consequences of co-loss of BRCA2 and RB1 in prostate cancer. We used CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi-based methods to eliminate these two genes in prostate cancer cell lines and subjected them to in vitro studies and transcriptomic analyses. We developed a 3-color FISH assay to detect genomic deletions of BRCA2 and RB1 in prostate cancer cells and patient-derived mCRPC organoids.                In human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and LAPC4), loss of BRCA2 leads to the castration-resistant phenotype. Co-loss of BRCA2-RB1 in human prostate cancer cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which is associated with invasiveness and a more aggressive disease phenotype. Importantly, PARP inhibitors attenuate cell growth in human mCRPC-derived organoids and human CRPC cells harboring single-copy loss of both genes.                Our findings suggest that early identification of this aggressive form of prostate cancer offers potential for improved outcomes with early introduction of PARP inhibitor-based therapy.See related commentary by Mandigo and Knudsen, p. 1784.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31883834        	Endometrial Axin2+ Cells Drive Epithelial Homeostasis, Regeneration, and Cancer following Oncogenic Transformation.            	The remarkable regenerative capacity of the endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus) is essential for the sustenance of mammalian life. Over the years, the role of stem cells in endometrial functions and their pathologies has been suggested; however, the identity and location of such stem cells remain unclear. Here, we used in vivo lineage tracing to show that endometrial epithelium self-renews during development, growth, and regeneration and identified Axin2, a classical Wnt reporter gene, as a marker of long-lived bipotent epithelial progenitors that reside in endometrial glands. Axin2-expressing cells are responsible for epithelial regeneration in vivo and for endometrial organoid development in vitro. Ablation of Axin2+ cells severely impairs endometrial homeostasis and compromises its regeneration. More important, upon oncogenic transformation, these cells can lead to endometrial cancer. These findings provide valuable insights into the cellular basis of endometrial functions and diseases.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

28497484        	CD44 variant isoform 9 emerges in response to injury and contributes to the regeneration of the gastric epithelium.            	The CD44 gene encodes several protein isoforms due to alternative splicing and post translational modifications. Given that CD44 variant isoform 9 (CD44v9) is expressed within Spasmolytic Polypeptide/TFF2-Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM) glands during repair, CD44v9 may be play a funcitonal role during the process of regeneration of the gastric epithelium. Here we hypothesize that CD44v9 marks a regenerative cell lineage responsive to infiltrating macrophages during regeneration of the gastric epithelium. Ulcers were induced in CD44-deficient (CD44KO) and C57BL/6 (BL6) mice by a localized application of acetic acid to the serosal surface of the stomach. Gastric organoids expressing CD44v9 were derived from mouse stomachs and transplanted at the ulcer site of CD44KO mice. Ulcers, CD44v9 expression, proliferation and histology were measured 1, 3, 5 and 7-days post-injury. Human-derived gastric organoids were generated from stomach tissue collected from elderly (>55 years) or young (14-20 years) patients. Organoids were transplanted into the stomachs of NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice at the site of injury. Gastric injury was induced in NRG-SGM3 (NRGS) mice harboring human-derived immune cells (hnNRGS) and the immune profile anlayzed by CyTOF. CD44v9 expression emerged within regenerating glands the ulcer margin in response to injury. While ulcers in BL6 mice healed within 7-days post-injury, CD44KO mice exhibited loss of repair and epithelial regeneration. Ulcer healing was promoted in CD44KO mice by transplanted CD55v9-expressing gastric organoids. NSG mice exhibited loss of CD44v9 expression and gastric repair. Transplantation of human-derived gastric organoids from young, but not aged stomachs promoted repair in NSG mouse stomachs in response to injury. Finally, compared to NRGS mice, huNRGS animals exhibited reduced ulcer sizes, an infiltration of human CD162+ macrophages and an emergence of CD44v9 expression in SPEM. Thus, during repair of the gastic epithelium CD44v9 emerges within a regenerative cell lineage that coincides with macrophage inflitration within the injured mucosa.

27376535        	Biology of lung cancer: genetic mutation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cancer stem cells.            	At present, most cases of unresectable cancer cannot be cured. Genetic mutations, EMT, and cancer stem cells are three major issues linked to poor prognosis in such cases, all connected by inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Issues on inter-/intra-tumor heterogeneity of genetic mutation could be resolved with recent and future technologies of deep sequencers, whereas, regarding such issues as the "same genome, different epigenome/phenotype", we expect to solve many of these problems in the future through further research in stem cell biology. We herein review and discuss the three major issues in the biology of cancers, especially from the standpoint of stem cell biology.	
32327656        	LGR5 marks targetable tumor-initiating cells in mouse liver cancer.            	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are thought to be the main drivers for disease progression and treatment resistance across various cancer types. Identifying and targeting these rare cancer cells, however, remains challenging with respect to therapeutic benefit. Here, we report the enrichment of LGR5 expressing cells, a well-recognized stem cell marker, in mouse liver tumors, and the upregulation of LGR5 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Isolated LGR5 expressing cells from mouse liver tumors are superior in initiating organoids and forming tumors upon engraftment, featuring candidate TICs. These cells are resistant to conventional treatment including sorafenib and 5-FU. Importantly, LGR5 lineage ablation significantly inhibits organoid initiation and tumor growth. The combination of LGR5 ablation with 5-FU, but not sorafenib, further augments the therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Thus, we have identified the LGR5+ compartment as an important TIC population, representing a viable therapeutic target for combating liver cancer.

Robust patient-derived platforms that recapitulate the cellular and molecular fingerprints of glioblastoma are crucial for developing effective therapies.

This simple-to-follow protocol allows assessing drug sensitivity, on-target activity, and combined drug synergy.

30700911        	Tissue curvature and apicobasal mechanical tension imbalance instruct cancer morphogenesis.            	Tubular epithelia are a basic building block of organs and a common site of cancer occurrence1-4. During tumorigenesis, transformed cells overproliferate and epithelial architecture is disrupted. However, the biophysical parameters that underlie the adoption of abnormal tumour tissue shapes are unknown. Here we show in the pancreas of mice that the morphology of epithelial tumours is determined by the interplay of cytoskeletal changes in transformed cells and the existing tubular geometry. To analyse the morphological changes in tissue architecture during the initiation of cancer, we developed a three-dimensional whole-organ imaging technique that enables tissue analysis at single-cell resolution. Oncogenic transformation of pancreatic ducts led to two types of neoplastic growth: exophytic lesions that expanded outwards from the duct and endophytic lesions that grew inwards to the ductal lumen. Myosin activity was higher apically than basally in wild-type cells, but upon transformation this gradient was lost in both lesion types. Three-dimensional vertex model simulations and a continuum theory of epithelial mechanics, which incorporate the cytoskeletal changes observed in transformed cells, indicated that the diameter of the source epithelium instructs the morphology of growing tumours. Three-dimensional imaging revealed that-consistent with theory predictions-small pancreatic ducts produced exophytic growth, whereas large ducts deformed endophytically. Similar patterns of lesion growth were observed in tubular epithelia of the liver and lung; this finding identifies tension imbalance and tissue curvature as fundamental determinants of epithelial tumorigenesis.	
31103464        	Reconciling environment-mediated metabolic heterogeneity with the oncogene-driven cancer paradigm in precision oncology.            	Precision oncology is the practice of matching one therapy to one specific patient, based on particular genetic tumor alterations, in order to achieve the best clinical response. Despite an expanding arsenal of targeted therapies, many patients still have a poor outcome because tumor cells show a remarkable capacity to develop drug resistance, thereby leading to tumor relapse. Besides genotype-driven resistance mechanisms, tumor microenvironment (TME) peculiarities strongly contribute to generate an intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity that affects disease progression and treatment outcome. In this Review, we describe how TME-mediated metabolic heterogeneities actively participate to therapeutic failure. We report how a lactate-based metabolic symbiosis acts as a mechanism of adaptive resistance to targeted therapies and we describe the role of mitochondrial metabolism, in particular oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), to support the growth and survival of therapy-resistant tumor cells in a variety of cancers. Finally, we detail potential metabolism-interfering therapeutic strategies aiming to eradicate OXPHOS-dependent relapse-sustaining malignant cells and we discuss relevant (pre)clinical models that may help integrate TME-driven metabolic heterogeneity in precision oncology.

29395055        	Phospholipid Remodeling and Cholesterol Availability Regulate Intestinal Stemness and Tumorigenesis.            	Adequate availability of cellular building blocks, including lipids, is a prerequisite for cellular proliferation, but excess dietary lipids are linked to increased cancer risk. Despite these connections, specific regulatory relationships between membrane composition, intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation, and tumorigenesis are unclear. We reveal an unexpected link between membrane phospholipid remodeling and cholesterol biosynthesis and demonstrate that cholesterol itself acts as a mitogen for ISCs. Inhibition of the phospholipid-remodeling enzyme Lpcat3 increases membrane saturation and stimulates cholesterol biosynthesis, thereby driving ISC proliferation. Pharmacologic inhibition of cholesterol synthesis normalizes crypt hyperproliferation in Lpcat3-deficient organoids and mice. Conversely, increasing cellular cholesterol content stimulates crypt organoid growth, and providing excess dietary cholesterol or driving endogenous cholesterol synthesis through SREBP-2 expression promotes ISC proliferation in vivo. Finally, disruption of Lpcat3-dependent phospholipid and cholesterol homeostasis dramatically enhances tumor formation in Apcmin mice. These findings identify a critical dietary-responsive phospholipid-cholesterol axis regulating ISC proliferation and tumorigenesis.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
30342032        	ZIP4 Promotes Muscle Wasting and Cachexia in Mice With Orthotopic Pancreatic Tumors by Stimulating RAB27B-Regulated Release of Extracellular Vesicles From Cancer Cells.            	Cachexia, which includes muscle wasting, is a frequent complication of pancreatic cancer. There are no therapies that reduce cachexia and increase patient survival, so it is important to learn more about its mechanisms. The zinc transporter ZIP4 promotes growth and metastasis of pancreatic tumors. We investigated its effects on muscle catabolism via extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (p38 MAPK).                We studied nude mice with orthotopic tumors grown from human pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1 and BxPC-3); tumors were removed 8 days after cell injection and analyzed by histology. Mouse survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves. ZIP4 was knocked down in AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells with small hairpin RNAs; cells with empty vectors were used as controls. Muscle tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Conditioned media from cell lines and 3-dimensional spheroid/organoid cultures of cancer cells were applied to C2C12 myotubes. The myotubes and the media were analyzed by immunoblots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunofluorescence microscopy. EVs were isolated from conditioned media and analyzed by immunoblots.                Mice with orthotopic tumors grown from pancreatic cancer cells with knockdown of ZIP4 survived longer and lost less body weight and muscle mass than mice with control tumors. Conditioned media from cancer cells activated p38 MAPK, induced expression of F-box protein 32 and UBR2 in C2C12 myotubes, and also led to loss of myofibrillar protein myosin heavy chain and myotube thinning. Knockdown of ZIP4 in cancer cells reduced these effects. ZIP4 knockdown also reduced pancreatic cancer cell release of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and HSP90, which are associated with EVs, by decreasing CREB-regulated expression of RAB27B.                ZIP4 promotes growth of orthotopic pancreatic tumors in mice and loss of muscle mass by activating CREB-regulated expression of RAB27B, required for release of EVs from pancreatic cancer cells. These EVs activate p38 MAPK and induce expression of F-box protein 32 and UBR2 in myotubes, leading to loss of myofibrillar myosin heavy chain and myotube thinning. Strategies to disrupt these pathways might be developed to reduce pancreatic cancer progression and accompanying cachexia.                Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

30935834        	Approaches to functionally validate candidate genetic variants involved in colorectal cancer predisposition.            	Most next generation sequencing (NGS) studies identified candidate genetic variants predisposing to colorectal cancer (CRC) but do not tackle its functional interpretation to unequivocally recognize a new hereditary CRC gene. Besides, germline variants in already established hereditary CRC-predisposing genes or somatic variants share the same need when trying to categorize those with relevant significance. Functional genomics approaches have an important role in identifying the causal links between genetic architecture and phenotypes, in order to decipher cellular function in health and disease. Therefore, functional interpretation of identified genetic variants by NGS platforms is now essential. Available approaches nowadays include bioinformatics, cell and molecular biology and animal models. Recent advances, such as the CRISPR-Cas9, ZFN and TALEN systems, have been already used as a powerful tool with this objective. However, the use of cell lines is of limited value due to the CRC heterogeneity and its close interaction with microenvironment. Access to tridimensional cultures or organoids and xenograft models that mimic the in vivo tissue architecture could revolutionize functional analysis. This review will focus on the application of state-of-the-art functional studies to better tackle new genes involved in germline predisposition to this neoplasm.

30799286        	Deubiquitinases Maintain Protein Homeostasis and Survival of Cancer Cells upon Glutathione Depletion.            	Cells are subjected to oxidative stress during the initiation and progression of tumors, and this imposes selective pressure for cancer cells to adapt mechanisms to tolerate these conditions. Here, we examined the dependency of cancer cells on glutathione (GSH), the most abundant cellular antioxidant. While cancer cell lines displayed a broad range of sensitivities to inhibition of GSH synthesis, the majority were resistant to GSH depletion. To identify cellular pathways required for this resistance, we carried out genetic and pharmacologic screens. Both approaches revealed that inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) sensitizes cancer cells to GSH depletion. Inhibition of GSH synthesis, in combination with DUB inhibition, led to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, induction of proteotoxic stress, and cell death. These results indicate that depletion of GSH renders cancer cells dependent on DUB activity to maintain protein homeostasis and cell viability and reveal a potentially exploitable vulnerability for cancer therapy.

24825889        	Oncogenic mutations in intestinal adenomas regulate Bim-mediated apoptosis induced by TGF-β.            	In the majority of microsatellite-stable colorectal cancers (CRCs), an initiating mutation occurs in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or β-catenin gene, activating the β-catenin/TCF pathway. The progression of resulting adenomas is associated with oncogenic activation of KRas and inactivation of the p53 and TGF-β/Smad functions. Most established CRC cell lines contain mutations in the TGF-β/Smad pathway, but little is known about the function of TGF-β in the early phases of intestinal tumorigenesis. We used mouse and human ex vivo 3D intestinal organoid cultures and in vivo mouse models to study the effect of TGF-β on the Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells and their progeny in intestinal adenomas. We found that the TGF-β-induced apoptosis in Apc-mutant organoids, including the Lgr5(+) stem cells, was mediated by up-regulation of the BH3-only proapoptotic protein Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bim). BH3-mimetic compounds recapitulated the effect of Bim not only in the adenomas but also in human CRC organoids that had lost responsiveness to TGF-β-induced apoptosis. However, wild-type intestinal crypts were markedly less sensitive to TGF-β than Apc-mutant adenomas, whereas the KRas oncogene increased resistance to TGF-β via the activation of the Erk1/2 kinase pathway, leading to Bim down-regulation. Our studies identify Bim as a critical mediator of TGF-β-induced apoptosis in intestinal adenomas and show that the common progression mutations modify Bim levels and sensitivity to TGF-β during intestinal adenoma development.

33060766        	Evaluation of the RAS signaling network in response to MEK inhibition using organoids derived from a familial adenomatous polyposis patient.            	RAS signaling is a promising target for colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy, and a variety of selective inhibitors have been developed. However, their use has often failed to demonstrate a significant benefit in CRC patients. Here, we used patient-derived organoids (PDOs) derived from a familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patient to analyze the response to chemotherapeutic agents targeting EGFR, BRAF and MEK. We found that PDOs carrying KRAS mutations were resistant to MEK inhibition, while those harboring the BRAF class 3 mutation were hypersensitive. We used a systematic approach to examine the phosphorylation of RAS effectors using reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) and found increased phosphorylation of MEK induced by binimetinib. A high basal level of ERK phosphorylation and its rebound activation after MEK inhibition were detected in KRAS-mutant PDOs. Notably, the phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT was more closely correlated with that of MEK than that of ERK. Transcriptome analysis identified MYC-mediated transcription and IFN signaling as significantly correlated gene sets in MEK inhibition. Our experiments demonstrated that RPPA analysis of PDOs, in combination with the genome and transcriptome, is a useful preclinical research platform to understand RAS signaling and provides clues for the development of chemotherapeutic strategies.

28628120        	Intestinal cancer progression by mutant p53 through the acquisition of invasiveness associated with complex glandular formation.            	Tumor suppressor TP53 is frequently mutated in colorectal cancer (CRC), and most mutations are missense type. Although gain-of-functions by mutant p53 have been demonstrated experimentally, the precise mechanism for malignant progression in in vivo tumors remains unsolved. We generated ApcΔ716 Trp53LSL•R270H villin-CreER compound mice, in which mutant p53R270H was expressed in the intestinal epithelia upon tamoxifen treatment, and examined the intestinal tumor phenotypes and tumor-derived organoids. Mutant Trp53R270H, but not Trp53-null mutation accelerated submucosal invasion with generation of desmoplastic microenvironment. The nuclear accumulation of p53 was evident in ApcΔ716 Trp53R270H/R270H homozygous tumors like human CRC. Although p53 was distributed to the cytoplasm in ApcΔ716 Trp53+/R270H heterozygous tumors, it accumulated in the nuclei at the invasion front, suggesting a regulation mechanism for p53 localization by the microenvironment. Importantly, mutant p53 induced drastic morphological changes in the tumor organoids to complex glandular structures, which was associated with the acquisition of invasiveness. Consistently, the branching scores of human CRC that carry TP53 mutations at codon 273 significantly increased in comparison with those of TP53 wild-type tumors. Moreover, allografted ApcΔ716 Trp53R270H/R270H organoid tumors showed a malignant histology with an increased number of myofibroblasts in the stroma. These results indicate that nuclear-accumulated mutant p53R270H induces malignant progression of intestinal tumors through complex tumor gland formation and acquisition of invasiveness. Furthermore, RNA sequencing analyses revealed global gene upregulation by mutant p53R270H, which was associated with the activation of inflammatory and innate immune pathways. Accordingly, it is possible that mutant p53R270H induces CRC progression, not only by a cell intrinsic mechanism, but also by the generation or activation of the microenvironment, which may synergistically contribute to the acceleration of submucosal invasion. Therefore, the present study indicates that nuclear-accumulated mutant p53R270H is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced CRCs.	
31182574        	Lineage tracing and targeting of IL17RB+ tuft cell-like human colorectal cancer stem cells.            	Cancer stem cell (CSC)-specific markers may be potential therapeutic targets. We previously identified that Dclk1, a tuft cell marker, marks tumor stem cells (TSCs) in mouse intestinal adenomas. Based on the analysis of mouse Dclk1+ tumor cells, we aimed to identify a CSC-specific cell surface marker in human colorectal cancers (hCRCs) and validate the therapeutic effect of targeting it. IL17RB was distinctively expressed by Dclk1+ mouse intestinal tumor cells. Using Il17rb-CreERT2-IRES-EGFP mice, we show that IL17RB marked intestinal TSCs in an IL13-dependent manner. Tuft cell-like cancer cells were detected in a subset of hCRCs. In these hCRCs, lineage-tracing experiments in CRISPR-Cas9-mediated IL17RB-CreERT2 knockin organoids and xenograft tumors revealed that IL17RB marks CSCs that expand independently of IL-13. We observed up-regulation of POU2F3, a master regulator of tuft cell differentiation, and autonomous tuft cell-like cancer cell differentiation in the hCRCs. Furthermore, long-term ablation of IL17RB-expressing CSCs strongly suppressed the tumor growth in vivo. These findings reveal insights into a CSC-specific marker IL17RB in a subset of hCRCs, and preclinically validate IL17RB+ CSCs as a cancer therapeutic target.	
30723303        	Met inhibition revokes IFNγ-induction of PD-1 ligands in MET-amplified tumours.            	Interferon-induced expression of programmed cell death ligands (PD-L1/PD-L2) may sustain tumour immune-evasion. Patients featuring MET amplification, a genetic lesion driving transformation, may benefit from anti-MET treatment. We explored if MET-targeted therapy interferes with Interferon-γ modulation of PD-L1/PD-L2 in MET-amplified tumours.                PD-L1/PD-L2 expression and signalling pathways downstream of MET or Interferon-γ were analysed in MET-amplified tumour cell lines and in patient-derived tumour organoids, in basal condition, upon Interferon-γ stimulation, and after anti-MET therapy.                PD-L1 and PD-L2 were upregulated in MET-amplified tumour cells upon Interferon-γ treatment. This induction was impaired by JNJ-605, a selective inhibitor of MET kinase activity, and MvDN30, an antibody inducing MET proteolytic cleavage. We found that activation of JAKs/ STAT1, signal transducers downstream of the Interferon-γ receptor, was neutralised by MET inhibitors. Moreover, JAK2 and MET associated in the same signalling complex depending on MET phosphorylation. Results were confirmed in MET-amplified organoids derived from human colorectal tumours, where JNJ-605 treatment revoked Interferon-γ induced PD-L1 expression.                These data show that in MET-amplified cancers, treatment with MET inhibitors counteracts the induction of PD-1 ligands by Interferon-γ. Thus, therapeutic use of anti-MET drugs may provide additional clinical benefit over and above the intended inhibition of the target oncogene.	
31915377        	TGF-β orchestrates fibrogenic and developmental EMTs via the RAS effector RREB1.            	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are phenotypic plasticity processes that confer migratory and invasive properties to epithelial cells during development, wound-healing, fibrosis and cancer1-4. EMTs are driven by SNAIL, ZEB and TWIST transcription factors5,6 together with microRNAs that balance this regulatory network7,8. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a potent inducer of developmental and fibrogenic EMTs4,9,10. Aberrant TGF-β signalling and EMT are implicated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis and cancer4,11. TGF-β depends on RAS and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inputs for the induction of EMTs12-19. Here we show how these signals coordinately trigger EMTs and integrate them with broader pathophysiological processes. We identify RAS-responsive element binding protein 1 (RREB1), a RAS transcriptional effector20,21, as a key partner of TGF-β-activated SMAD transcription factors in EMT. MAPK-activated RREB1 recruits TGF-β-activated SMAD factors to SNAIL. Context-dependent chromatin accessibility dictates the ability of RREB1 and SMAD to activate additional genes that determine the nature of the resulting EMT. In carcinoma cells, TGF-β-SMAD and RREB1 directly drive expression of SNAIL and fibrogenic factors stimulating myofibroblasts, promoting intratumoral fibrosis and supporting tumour growth. In mouse epiblast progenitors, Nodal-SMAD and RREB1 combine to induce expression of SNAIL and mesendoderm-differentiation genes that drive gastrulation. Thus, RREB1 provides a molecular link between RAS and TGF-β pathways for coordinated induction of developmental and fibrogenic EMTs. These insights increase our understanding of the regulation of epithelial plasticity and its pathophysiological consequences in development, fibrosis and cancer.	
27573849        	Reg4+ deep crypt secretory cells function as epithelial niche for Lgr5+ stem cells in colon.            	Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5-positive (Lgr5(+)) stem cells reside at crypt bottoms of the small and large intestine. Small intestinal Paneth cells supply Wnt3, EGF, and Notch signals to neighboring Lgr5(+) stem cells. Whereas the colon lacks Paneth cells, deep crypt secretory (DCS) cells are intermingled with Lgr5(+) stem cells at crypt bottoms. Here, we report regenerating islet-derived family member 4 (Reg4) as a marker of DCS cells. To investigate a niche function, we eliminated DCS cells by using the diphtheria-toxin receptor gene knocked into the murine Reg4 locus. Ablation of DCS cells results in loss of stem cells from colonic crypts and disrupts gut homeostasis and colon organoid growth. In agreement, sorted Reg4(+) DCS cells promote organoid formation of single Lgr5(+) colon stem cells. DCS cells can be massively produced from Lgr5(+) colon stem cells in vitro by combined Notch inhibition and Wnt activation. We conclude that Reg4(+) DCS cells serve as Paneth cell equivalents in the colon crypt niche.	
30591184        	Primary Cell-Derived Intestinal Models: Recapitulating Physiology.            	The development of physiologically relevant intestinal models fueled by breakthroughs in primary cell-culture methods has enabled successful recapitulation of key features of intestinal physiology. These advances, paired with engineering methods, for example incorporating chemical gradients or physical forces across the tissues, have yielded ever more sophisticated systems that enhance our understanding of the impact of the host microbiome on human physiology as well as on the genesis of intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. In this review we highlight recent advances in the development and usage of primary cell-derived intestinal models incorporating monolayers, organoids, microengineered platforms, and macrostructured systems, and discuss the expected directions of the field.

31911540        	Diverse BRAF Gene Fusions Confer Resistance to EGFR-Targeted Therapy via Differential Modulation of BRAF Activity.            	Fusion genes can be oncogenic drivers in a variety of cancer types and represent potential targets for targeted therapy. The BRAF gene is frequently involved in oncogenic gene fusions, with fusion frequencies of 0.2%-3% throughout different cancers. However, BRAF fusions rarely occur in the same gene configuration, potentially challenging personalized therapy design. In particular, the impact of the wide variety of fusion partners on the oncogenic role of BRAF during tumor growth and drug response is unknown. Here, we used patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids to functionally characterize and cross-compare BRAF fusions containing various partner genes (AGAP3, DLG1, and TRIM24) with respect to cellular behavior, downstream signaling activation, and response to targeted therapies. We demonstrate that 5' fusion partners mainly promote canonical oncogenic BRAF activity by replacing the auto-inhibitory N-terminal region. In addition, the 5' partner of BRAF fusions influences their subcellular localization and intracellular signaling capacity, revealing distinct subsets of affected signaling pathways and altered gene expression. Presence of the different BRAF fusions resulted in varying sensitivities to combinatorial inhibition of MEK and the EGF receptor family. However, all BRAF fusions conveyed resistance to targeted monotherapy against the EGF receptor family, suggesting that BRAF fusions should be screened alongside other MAPK pathway alterations to identify patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to exclude from anti-EGFR-targeted treatment. IMPLICATIONS: Although intracellular signaling and sensitivity to targeted therapies of BRAF fusion genes are influenced by their 5' fusion partner, we show that all investigated BRAF fusions confer resistance to clinically relevant EGFR inhibition.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
27511199        	RSPO3 expands intestinal stem cell and niche compartments and drives tumorigenesis.            	The gross majority of colorectal cancer cases results from aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signalling through adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or CTNNB1 mutations. However, a subset of human colon tumours harbour, mutually exclusive with APC and CTNNB1 mutations, gene fusions in RSPO2 or RSPO3, leading to enhanced expression of these R-spondin genes. This suggested that RSPO activation can substitute for the most common mutations as an alternative driver for intestinal cancer. Involvement of RSPO3 in tumour growth was recently shown in RSPO3-fusion-positive xenograft models. The current study determines the extent into which solely a gain in RSPO3 actually functions as a driver of intestinal cancer in a direct, causal fashion, and addresses the in vivo activities of RSPO3 in parallel.                We generated a conditional Rspo3 transgenic mouse model in which the Rspo3 transgene is expressed upon Cre activity. Cre is provided by cross-breeding with Lgr5-GFP-CreERT2 mice.                Upon in vivo Rspo3 expression, mice rapidly developed extensive hyperplastic, adenomatous and adenocarcinomatous lesions throughout the intestine. RSPO3 induced the expansion of Lgr5+ stem cells, Paneth cells, non-Paneth cell label-retaining cells and Lgr4+ cells, thus promoting both intestinal stem cell and niche compartments. Wnt/β-catenin signalling was modestly increased upon Rspo3 expression and mutant Kras synergised with Rspo3 in hyperplastic growth.                We provide in vivo evidence that RSPO3 stimulates the crypt stem cell and niche compartments and drives rapid intestinal tumorigenesis. This establishes RSPO3 as a potent driver of intestinal cancer and proposes RSPO3 as a candidate target for therapy in patients with colorectal cancer harbouring RSPO3 fusions.

27477511        	NRF2 Promotes Tumor Maintenance by Modulating mRNA Translation in Pancreatic Cancer.            	Pancreatic cancer is a deadly malignancy that lacks effective therapeutics. We previously reported that oncogenic Kras induced the redox master regulator Nfe2l2/Nrf2 to stimulate pancreatic and lung cancer initiation. Here, we show that NRF2 is necessary to maintain pancreatic cancer proliferation by regulating mRNA translation. Specifically, loss of NRF2 led to defects in autocrine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and oxidation of specific translational regulatory proteins, resulting in impaired cap-dependent and cap-independent mRNA translation in pancreatic cancer cells. Combined targeting of the EGFR effector AKT and the glutathione antioxidant pathway mimicked Nrf2 ablation to potently inhibit pancreatic cancer ex vivo and in vivo, representing a promising synthetic lethal strategy for treating the disease.

33352247        	An aptamer-based drug delivery agent (CD133-apt-Dox) selectively and effectively kills liver cancer stem-like cells.            	Liver cancer has no effective therapies, hence a poor survival. Cancer stem-like cells not only contribute to cancer initiation and progression, but also to drug resistance, cancer metastasis, and eventually treatment failure. Hence, any approaches that can effectively kill cancer stem-like cells hold a great potential for cancer treatment. CD133 is a robust marker for liver cancer stem-like cells. We developed a specific aptamer against CD133 (CD133-apt), and then loaded this aptamer with an anticancer drug doxorubicin (CD133-apt-Dox). The efficacy of CD133-apt-Dox in targeting liver cancer stem-like cells and its overall effect in treating liver cancer were investigated using multiple in vitro and in vivo studies including in patients-derived liver cancer organoids. We have observed that CD133-apt could preferably delivered doxorubicin to CD133-expressing cells with efficient drug accumulation and retention. CD133-apt-Dox impaired the self-renewal capacity of liver cancer stem-like cells and attenuated their stem-ness phenotypes in vitro or in vivo. CD133-apt-Dox significantly inhibited the growth of liver cancer cells and patients-derived organoids and reduced the growth of xenograft tumours in nude mice inhibited the growth of DEN-induced liver cancer in immunocompetent mice. Hence, aptamer-mediated targeting of CD133 is a highly promising approach for liver cancer therapy.                Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
29282223        	Combined Mutation of Apc, Kras, and Tgfbr2 Effectively Drives Metastasis of Intestinal Cancer.            	Colorectal cancer is driven by the accumulation of driver mutations, but the contributions of specific mutations to different steps in malignant progression are not fully understood. In this study, we generated mouse models harboring different combinations of key colorectal cancer driver mutations (Apc, Kras, Tgfbr2, Trp53, Fbxw7) in intestinal epithelial cells to comprehensively investigate their roles in the development of primary tumors and metastases. ApcΔ716 mutation caused intestinal adenomas and combination with Trp53R270H mutation or Tgfbr2 deletion induced submucosal invasion. The addition of KrasG12D mutation yielded epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like morphology and lymph vessel intravasation of the invasive tumors. In contrast, combinations of ApcΔ716 with KrasG12D and Fbxw7 mutation were insufficient for submucosal invasion, but still induced EMT-like histology. Studies using tumor-derived organoids showed that KrasG12D was critical for liver metastasis following splenic transplantation, when this mutation was combined with either ApcΔ716 plus Trp53R270H or Tgfbr2 deletion, with the highest incidence of metastasis displayed by tumors with a ApcΔ716 KrasG12D Tgfbr2-/- genotype. RNA sequencing analysis of tumor organoids defined distinct gene expression profiles characteristic for the respective combinations of driver mutations, with upregulated genes in ApcΔ716 KrasG12D Tgfbr2-/- tumors found to be similarly upregulated in specimens of human metastatic colorectal cancer. Our results show how activation of Wnt and Kras with suppression of TGFβ signaling in intestinal epithelial cells is sufficient for colorectal cancer metastasis, with possible implications for the development of metastasis prevention strategies.Significance: These findings illuminate how key driver mutations in colon cancer cooperate to drive the development of metastatic disease, with potential implications for the development of suitable prevention strategies.

32355025        	Regenerative potential of prostate luminal cells revealed by single-cell analysis.            	Androgen deprivation is the cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment. It results in involution of the normal gland to ~90% of its original size because of the loss of luminal cells. The prostate regenerates when androgen is restored, a process postulated to involve stem cells. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a rare luminal population in the mouse prostate that expresses stemlike genes (Sca1+ and Psca+) and a large population of differentiated cells (Nkx3.1+, Pbsn+). In organoids and in mice, both populations contribute equally to prostate regeneration, partly through androgen-driven expression of growth factors (Nrg2, Rspo3) by mesenchymal cells acting in a paracrine fashion on luminal cells. Analysis of human prostate tissue revealed similar differentiated and stemlike luminal subpopulations that likewise acquire enhanced regenerative potential after androgen ablation. We propose that prostate regeneration is driven by nearly all persisting luminal cells, not just by rare stem cells.

30996297        	Loss of PKM2 in Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells promotes colitis-associated colorectal cancer.            	The regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), the key glycolytic enzyme, influence altered energy metabolism including glycolysis in cancer. In this study, we found that PKM2 was highly expressed in patients with ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer (CRC). We then investigated the effectiveness of conditionally ablating PKM2 in Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISC) using a mouse model of colitis-associated CRC (AOM plus DSS). Tamoxifen-inducible Lgr5-driven deletion of PKM2 in ISC (PKM2ΔLgr5-Tx) significantly promoted tumor incidence and size in the colon and lower body weight compared with findings in vehicle-treated mice (PKM2ΔLgr5-Veh). Histopathologic analysis revealed considerable high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in the colon of PKM2ΔLgr5-Tx mice while PKM2ΔLgr5-Veh mice had low- and high-grade dysplasia. Loss of PKM2 was associated with dominant expression of PKM1 in Lgr5+ ISC and their progeny cells. Further, the organoid-forming efficiency of whole cancer cells or Lgr5+ cells obtained from colon polyps of PKM2ΔLgr5-Tx mice was significantly increased when compared with PKM2ΔLgr5-Veh mice. Cancer organoids from PKM2ΔLgr5-Tx mice exhibited increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and a shift of metabolites involved in energy metabolism. These findings suggest that loss of PKM2 function in ISC promotes colitis-associated CRC.	
31739555        	iPSCs-Based Neural 3D Systems: A Multidimensional Approach for Disease Modeling and Drug Discovery.            	Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-based two-dimensional (2D) protocols have offered invaluable insights into the pathophysiology of neurological diseases. However, these systems are unable to reproduce complex cytoarchitectural features, cell-cell and tissue-tissue interactions like their in vivo counterpart. Three-dimensional (3D)-based culture protocols, though in their infancy, have offered new insights into modeling human diseases. Human neural organoids try to recapitulate the cellular diversity of complex tissues and can be generated from iPSCs to model the pathophysiology of a wide spectrum of pathologies. The engraftment of iPSCs into mice models and the improvement of differentiation protocols towards 3D cultures has enabled the generation of more complex multicellular systems. Consequently, models of neuropsychiatric disorders, infectious diseases, brain cancer and cerebral hypoxic injury can now be investigated from new perspectives. In this review, we consider the advancements made in modeling neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases with iPSC-derived organoids and their potential use to develop new drugs.	
25772967        	Ophthalmic manifestations of linear nevus sebaceous/organoid nevus syndrome.            	Linear Nevus Sebaceous Syndrome (LNSS) is a rare sporadic oculoneurocutaneous disorder, also classified as Organoid Nevus Syndrome. It consists of a triad of midline facial linear nevus sebaceous, central nervous system and ocular abnormalities. To the best of authors' knowledge ophthalmic features of LNSS have never been reported in Pakistani population. We report two cases of LNSS, associated with multiple cutaneous nevus sebaceous lesions, complex ocular choristomas and rare bilateral presentation in one patient. Ocular choristomas included limbal dermoids, dermolipomas at superior fornices and chroidal choristoma. Ocular surface was successfully reconstructed by excision of limbal dermoids, partial keratectomy and amniotic membrane transplant.	
29901119        	CRISPR therapeutic tools for complex genetic disorders and cancer (Review).            	One of the fundamental discoveries in the field of biology is the ability to modulate the genome and to monitor the functional outputs derived from genomic alterations. In order to unravel new therapeutic options, scientists had initially focused on inducing genetic alterations in primary cells, in established cancer cell lines and mouse models using either RNA interference or cDNA overexpression or various programmable nucleases [zinc finger nucleases (ZNF), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN)]. Even though a huge volume of data was produced, its use was neither cheap nor accurate. Therefore, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system was evidenced to be the next step in genome engineering tools. CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated genetic perturbation is simple, precise and highly efficient, empowering researchers to apply this method to immortalized cancerous cell lines, primary cells derived from mouse and human origins, xenografts, induced pluripotent stem cells, organoid cultures, as well as the generation of genetically engineered animal models. In this review, we assess the development of the CRISPR system and its therapeutic applications to a wide range of complex diseases (particularly distinct tumors), aiming at personalized therapy. Special emphasis is given to organoids and CRISPR screens in the design of innovative therapeutic approaches. Overall, the CRISPR system is regarded as an eminent genome engineering tool in therapeutics. We envision a new era in cancer biology during which the CRISPR-based genome engineering toolbox will serve as the fundamental conduit between the bench and the bedside; nonetheless, certain obstacles need to be addressed, such as the eradication of side-effects, maximization of efficiency, the assurance of delivery and the elimination of immunogenicity.	
30727877        	Cancer-on-a-chip for Drug Screening.            	The oncology pharmaceutical research spent a shocking amount of money on target validation and drug optimization in preclinical models because many oncology drugs fail during clinical trial phase III. One of the most important reasons for oncology drug failures in clinical trials may due to the poor predictive tool of existing preclinical models. Therefore, in cancer research and personalized medicine field, it is critical to improve the effectiveness of preclinical predictions of the drug response of patients to therapies and to reduce costly failures in clinical trials. Three dimensional (3D) tumor models combine micro-manufacturing technologies mimic critical physiologic parameters present in vivo, including complex multicellular architecture with multicellular arrangement and extracellular matrix deposition, packed 3D structures with cell-cell interactions, such as tight junctions, barriers to mass transport of drugs, nutrients and other factors, which are similar to in vivo tumor tissues. These systems provide a solution to mimic the physiological environment for improving predictive accuracy in oncology drug discovery. This review gives an overview of the innovations, development and limitations of different types of tumor-like construction techniques such as self-assemble spheroid formation, spheroids formation by micro-manufacturing technologies, micro-dissected tumor tissues and tumor organoid. Combination of 3D tumor-like construction and microfluidic techniques to achieve tumor on a chip for in vitro tumor environment modeling and drug screening were all included. Eventually, developmental directions and technical challenges in the research field are also discussed. We believe tumor on chip models have provided better sufficient clinical predictive power and will bridge the gap between proof-of-concept studies and a wider implementation within the oncology drug development for pathophysiological applications.

28581476        	Lgr5-expressing chief cells drive epithelial regeneration and cancer in the oxyntic stomach.            	The daily renewal of the corpus epithelium is fuelled by adult stem cells residing within tubular glands, but the identity of these stem cells remains controversial. Lgr5 marks homeostatic stem cells and 'reserve' stem cells in multiple tissues. Here, we report Lgr5 expression in a subpopulation of chief cells in mouse and human corpus glands. Using a non-variegated Lgr5-2A-CreERT2 mouse model, we show by lineage tracing that Lgr5-expressing chief cells do not behave as corpus stem cells during homeostasis, but are recruited to function as stem cells to effect epithelial renewal following injury by activating Wnt signalling. Ablation of Lgr5+ cells severely impairs epithelial homeostasis in the corpus, indicating an essential role for these Lgr5+ cells in maintaining the homeostatic stem cell pool. We additionally define Lgr5+ chief cells as a major cell-of-origin of gastric cancer. These findings reveal clinically relevant insights into homeostasis, repair and cancer in the corpus.	
31506938        	Metastatic seeding of human colon cancer cell clusters expressing the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state.            	Emerging evidence supports the theory that tumor cell clusters efficiently metastasize to distant organs. However, the roles of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in metastasizing tumor cell clusters have not yet been fully elucidated. To investigate this issue, tumor fragments were dissected from 40 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice. We observed that tumors developed from the tumor fragments obtained from 28 of the 40 CRC patients. The tumors were then dissociated into cell suspensions to be orthotopically injected into secondary mice. The tumors from 13 of the 28 patients progressed. Furthermore, metastases formed spontaneously in the liver and lungs from the tumor fragments obtained from 8 of these 13 patients. Moreover, employing a mathematical analysis, we showed that tumor cell clusters seeded these metastases significantly more often than did single tumor cells. Membrane E-cadherin- and nuclear ZEB1-positive tumor cells indicating the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state were also detected in primary tumors of various CRC patients, and in the corresponding patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and circulating tumor cell clusters in the bloodstreams of mice. In contrast, ZEB1 staining was barely detectable in the patient-matched liver metastases presumably developing through mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. Inhibition of E-cadherin or ZEB1 expression by shRNA notably prevented the PDX-derived tumor organoids from colonizing the liver, when injected intrasplenically into mice, indicating E-cadherin and ZEB1 expressions to be required for their metastatic colonization. Taken together, these findings suggest that the epithelial/mesenchymal state mediates metastatic seeding of human CRC cell clusters into distant organs.                © 2019 UICC.	
32393270        	LncRNA TROJAN promotes proliferation and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor via CDK2 transcriptional activation in ER+ breast cancer.            	Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers represent approximately two-thirds of all breast cancers and have a sustained risk of late disease recurrence. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors have shown significant efficacy in ER+ breast cancer. However, their effects are still limited by drug resistance. In this study, we aim to explore the role of long noncoding RNA TROJAN in ER+ breast cancer.                The expression level of TROJAN in breast cancer tissue and cell lines was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. In vitro and in vivo assays as well as patient derived organoid were preformed to explore the phenotype of TROJAN in ER+ breast cancer. The TROJAN-NKRF-CDK2 axis were screened and validated by RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, microarray, dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.                Herein, we showed that TROJAN was highly expressed in ER+ breast cancer. TROJAN promoted cell proliferation and resistance to a CDK4/6 inhibitor and was associated with poor survival in ER+ breast cancer. TROJAN can bind to NKRF and inhibit its interaction with RELA, upregulating the expression of CDK2. The inhibition of TROJAN abolished the activity of CDK2, reversing the resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor. A TROJAN antisense oligonucleotide sensitized breast cancer cells and organoid to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib both in vitro and in vivo.                TROJAN promotes ER+ breast cancer proliferation and is a potential target for reversing CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance.	
29499836        	New tools for old drugs: Functional genetic screens to optimize current chemotherapy.            	Despite substantial advances in the treatment of various cancers, many patients still receive anti-cancer therapies that hardly eradicate tumor cells but inflict considerable side effects. To provide the best treatment regimen for an individual patient, a major goal in molecular oncology is to identify predictive markers for a personalized therapeutic strategy. Regarding novel targeted anti-cancer therapies, there are usually good markers available. Unfortunately, however, targeted therapies alone often result in rather short remissions and little cytotoxic effect on the cancer cells. Therefore, classical chemotherapy with frequent long remissions, cures, and a clear effect on cancer cell eradication remains a corner stone in current anti-cancer therapy. Reliable biomarkers which predict the response of tumors to classical chemotherapy are rare, in contrast to the situation for targeted therapy. For the bulk of cytotoxic therapeutic agents, including DNA-damaging drugs, drugs targeting microtubules or antimetabolites, there are still no reliable biomarkers used in the clinic to predict tumor response. To make progress in this direction, meticulous studies of classical chemotherapeutic drug action and resistance mechanisms are required. For this purpose, novel functional screening technologies have emerged as successful technologies to study chemotherapeutic drug response in a variety of models. They allow a systematic analysis of genetic contributions to a drug-responsive or -sensitive phenotype and facilitate a better understanding of the mode of action of these drugs. These functional genomic approaches are not only useful for the development of novel targeted anti-cancer drugs but may also guide the use of classical chemotherapeutic drugs by deciphering novel mechanisms influencing a tumor's drug response. Moreover, due to the advances of 3D organoid cultures from patient tumors and in vivo screens in mice, these genetic screens can be applied using conditions that are more representative of the clinical setting. Patient-derived 3D organoid lines furthermore allow the characterization of the "essentialome", the specific set of genes required for survival of these cells, of an individual tumor, which could be monitored over the course of treatment and help understanding how drug resistance evolves in clinical tumors. Thus, we expect that these functional screens will enable the discovery of novel cancer-specific vulnerabilities, and through clinical validation, move the field of predictive biomarkers forward.

30542657        	CRISPR-Induced TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusions in Mouse Prostate Organoids.            	TMPRSS2-ERG fusions are common genetic events in prostate cancer. Until now, this genetic alteration was modelled by ERG overexpression. In this short communication, we report the creation of mouse prostate organoids that have undergone gene fusion through a CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy. The genetic fusion of TMPRSS2 and ERG results in ERG overexpression. This effect is androgen receptor-mediated, as expression of the fusion transcript can be restored to wildtype ERG levels by treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist Nilutamide.	
33019652        	Blocking c-MET/ERBB1 Axis Prevents Brain Metastasis in ERBB2+ Breast Cancer.            	Brain metastasis (BrM) remains a significant cause of cancer-related mortality in epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (ERBB2+) breast cancer (BC) patients. We proposed here that a combination treatment of irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib (NER) and the c-MET inhibitor cabozantinib (CBZ) could prevent brain metastasis. To address this, we first tested the combination treatment of NER and CBZ in the brain-seeking ERBB2+ cell lines SKBrM3 and JIMT-1-BR3, and in ERBB2+ organoids that expressed the c-MET/ERBB1 axis. Next, we developed and characterized an orthotopic mouse model of spontaneous BrM and evaluated the therapeutic effect of CBZ and NER in vivo. The combination treatment of NER and CBZ significantly inhibited proliferation and migration in ERBB2+ cell lines and reduced the organoid growth in vitro. Mechanistically, the combination treatment of NER and CBZ substantially inhibited ERK activation downstream of the c-MET/ERBB1 axis. Orthotopically implanted SKBrM3+ cells formed primary tumor in the mammary fat pad and spontaneously metastasized to the brain and other distant organs. Combination treatment with NER and CBZ inhibited primary tumor growth and predominantly prevented BrM. In conclusion, the orthotopic model of spontaneous BrM is clinically relevant, and the combination therapy of NER and CBZ might be a useful approach to prevent BrM in BC.

32747956        	A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-enriched environmental chemical mixture enhances AhR, antiapoptotic signaling and a proliferative phenotype in breast cancer cells.            	Emerging evidence suggests the role of environmental chemicals, in particular endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), in progression of breast cancer and treatment resistance, which can impact survival outcomes. However, most research tends to focus on tumor etiology and the effect of single chemicals, offering little insight into the effects of realistic complex mixture exposures on tumor progression. Herein, we investigated the effect of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-enriched EDC mixture in a panel of normal and breast cancer cells and in a tumor organoid model. Cells or organoids in culture were treated with EDC mixture at doses estimated from US adult intake of the top four PAH compounds within the mixture from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database. We demonstrate that low-dose PAH mixture (6, 30 and 300 nM) increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression and CYP activity in estrogen receptor (ER) positive but not normal mammary or ER-negative breast cancer cells, and that upregulated AhR signaling corresponded with increased cell proliferation and expression of antiapoptotic and antioxidant proteins XIAP and SOD1. We employed a mathematical model to validate PAH-mediated increases in AhR and XIAP expression in the MCF-7 ER-positive cell line. Furthermore, the PAH mixture caused significant growth increases in ER-negative breast cancer cell derived 3D tumor organoids, providing further evidence for the role of a natural-derived PAH mixture in enhancing a tumor proliferative phenotype. Together, our integrated cell signaling, computational and phenotype analysis reveals the underlying mechanisms of EDC mixtures in breast cancer progression and survival.                © The Author(s) 2020.

29045831        	USP7 Is a Tumor-Specific WNT Activator for APC-Mutated Colorectal Cancer by Mediating β-Catenin Deubiquitination.            	The tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is mutated in most colorectal cancers (CRCs), resulting in constitutive Wnt activation. To understand the Wnt-activating mechanism of the APC mutation, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer various APC-truncated isogenic lines. We find that the β-catenin inhibitory domain (CID) in APC represents the threshold for pathological levels of Wnt activation and tumor transformation. Mechanistically, CID-deleted APC truncation promotes β-catenin deubiquitination through reverse binding of β-TrCP and USP7 to the destruction complex. USP7 depletion in APC-mutated CRC inhibits Wnt activation by restoring β-catenin ubiquitination, drives differentiation, and suppresses xenograft tumor growth. Finally, the Wnt-activating role of USP7 is specific to APC mutations; thus, it can be used as a tumor-specific therapeutic target for most CRCs.

33217450        	Wnt Signaling Shapes the Histologic Variation in Diffuse Gastric Cancer.            	Diffuse-type gastric cancer (GC) is currently subdivided into signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) and non-SRCC, referred to as poorly cohesive carcinoma not otherwise specified (PCC-NOS). Although these subtypes are considered to be independent, they often coexist in the same tumors, raising a question of whether they clonally differ or not. To tackle this question, we established an experimental platform for human diffuse GC that enables accurate modeling of histologic subtypes.                Seven patient-derived diffuse GC organoid lines were established, characterized by histopathologic analysis, in situ hybridization, and gene expression analysis. For genetic modeling of diffuse GC, we knocked out CDH1 and/or TP53 in human normal gastric organoids. Green fluorescent protein-labeled GC organoids were xenotransplanted into immune-deficient mice for in vivo assessment.                PCC-NOS organoids transformed into SRCC-like structures on removal of Wnt and R-spondin from the culture medium. This morphologic change paralleled downregulation of Wnt-target and gastric stem cell genes, including LGR5, and elevation of differentiation markers, such as KRT20 and MUCs. The association between Wnt target gene expression and histologic subtypes was confirmed in 3 patient-derived GC tissues. In vivo, single clone-derived organoids formed tumors that comprised 2 distinct histologic compartments, each corresponding to SRCC and PCC-NOS. The transition from PCC-NOS to SRCC histology reflected the abundance of surrounding R-spondin-expressing fibroblasts.                SRCC and PCC-NOS were clonally identical, and their morphology was regulated by extracellular Wnt and R-spondin expression. Our results decoded how genetic mutations and the tumor environment shape pathohistologic and biologic phenotypes in human diffuse GCs.                Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

28416576        	Pathways Involved in Formation of Mammary Organoid Architecture Have Keys to Understanding Drug Resistance and to Discovery of Druggable Targets.            	Signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM) are received at the cell surface receptor, transmitted to the cytoskeletons, and transferred to the nucleus and chromatin for tissue- and context-specific gene expression. Cells, in return, modulate the cell shape and ECM, allowing for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis as well as for coevolution and adaptation to the environmental signals. We postulated the existence of dynamic and reciprocal interactions between the ECM and the nucleus more than three decades ago, but now these pathways have been proven experimentally thanks to the advances in imaging and cell/molecular biology techniques. In this review, we will introduce some of our recent work that has validated the critical roles of the three-dimensional (3D) tissue architecture in determining mammary biology, therapeutic response, and druggable targets. We describe a novel screen based on reversion of the malignant phenotype in 3D assays. We will also summarize our recent discoveries of the integration of feedback signaling for mammary acinar formation and phenotypic reversion of tumor cells in the LrECM. Lastly, we will introduce our exciting discovery of the physical linkages between the cell surface and cytofibers within a tunnel deep inside of the nucleus, enabling interaction with nuclear lamin and SUN proteins.                © 2016 Furuta and Bissell; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
29959990        	Preclinical models for precision oncology.            	Precision medicine approaches have revolutionized oncology. Personalized treatments require not only identification of the driving molecular alterations, but also development of targeted therapies and diagnostic tests to identify the appropriate patient populations for clinical trials and subsequent therapeutic implementation. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo models are widely used to predict efficacy of newly developed treatments. Here we discuss whether, and to what extent, preclinical models including cell lines, organoids and tumorgrafts recapitulate key features of human tumors. The potential of preclinical models to anticipate treatment efficacy and clinical benefit is also presented, using examples in different tumor types.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

26826297        	3D modeling of human cancer: A PEG-fibrin hydrogel system to study the role of tumor microenvironment and recapitulate the in vivo effect of oncolytic adenovirus.            	Interactions between malignant and stromal cells and the 3D spatial architecture of the tumor both substantially modify tumor behavior, including the responses to small molecule drugs and biological therapies. Conventional 2D culture systems cannot replicate this complexity. To overcome these limitations and more accurately model solid tumors, we developed a highly versatile 3D PEG-fibrin hydrogel model of human lung adenocarcinoma. Our model relevantly recapitulates the effect of oncolytic adenovirus; tumor responses in this setting nearly reproduce those observed in vivo. We have also validated the use of this model for complex, long-term, 3D cultures of cancer cells and their stroma (fibroblasts and endothelial cells). Both tumor proliferation and invasiveness were enhanced in the presence of stromal components. These results validate our 3D hydrogel model as a relevant platform to study cancer biology and tumor responses to biological treatments.                 Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

26747706        	miR-137 Regulates the Tumorigenicity of Colon Cancer Stem Cells through the Inhibition of DCLK1.            	miRNAs have important roles in regulating cancer stem cell (CSC) properties and are considered to be potential therapeutic targets. However, few studies have focused on miRNAs which are specifically related to colon CSCs. Here, a PCR-based miRNA profiling analysis of normal colon stem cells (NCSC) and colon CSCs (EpCAM⁺/CD44⁺/CD66a⁻) identified miRNAs which regulate colon CSC properties. Interestingly, miRNA-137 (miR-137) expression was downregulated in the colon CSCs compared with NCSCs, while doublecortin-like kinase 1(DCLK1) mRNA was highly expressed in the colon CSCs but low in the NCSCs. In fact, DCLK1-positive cancer cells were widely distributed in clinically resected colon cancer specimens, while DCLK1-positve epithelial cells were rarely detected in normal colon tissues including the crypt bottoms. Luciferase assay and immunoblot analysis revealed that miR-137 regulated DCLK1 gene expression. Transduction of exogenous miR-137 suppressed the development of colon cancer organoids in vitro and the tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells in vivo without affecting the growth of normal intestinal organoids. Furthermore, the suppression of miR-137 enhanced the organoid development of normal colon cells. These data demonstrate that miR-137 has the capacity to suppress the tumorigenicity of colon CSCs and that maintained expression of miR-137 in NCSCs contributes to suppressing uncontrolled cell proliferation through the inhibition of DCLK1 expression.                The miR-137/DCLK1 axis as an important regulator in NCSCs and colon CSCs; further understanding of this axis may foster the development of potential gene therapeutic strategies targeting colon CSCs.                ©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30998992        	High-Fat Diet Accelerates Carcinogenesis in a Mouse Model of Barrett's Esophagus via Interleukin 8 and Alterations to the Gut Microbiome.            	Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Progression from BE to cancer is associated with obesity, possibly due to increased abdominal pressure and gastroesophageal reflux disease, although this pathogenic mechanism has not been proven. We investigated whether environmental or dietary factors associated with obesity contribute to the progression of BE to EAC in mice.                Tg(ED-L2-IL1RN/IL1B)#Tcw mice (a model of BE, called L2-IL1B mice) were fed a chow (control) or high-fat diet (HFD) or were crossbred with mice that express human interleukin (IL) 8 (L2-IL1B/IL8 mice). Esophageal tissues were collected and analyzed for gene expression profiles and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. Organoids were established from BE tissue of mice and cultured with serum from lean or obese individuals or with neutrophils from L2-IL1B mice. Feces from mice were analyzed by 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing and compared to 16s sequencing data from patients with dysplasia or BE. L2-IL1B were mice raised in germ-free conditions.                L2-IL1B mice fed an HFD developed esophageal dysplasia and tumors more rapidly than mice fed the control diet; the speed of tumor development was independent of body weight. The acceleration of dysplasia by the HFD in the L2-IL1B mice was associated with a shift in the gut microbiota and an increased ratio of neutrophils to natural killer cells in esophageal tissues compared with mice fed a control diet. We observed similar differences in the microbiomes from patients with BE that progressed to EAC vs patients with BE that did not develop into cancer. Tissues from dysplasias of L2-IL1B mice fed the HFD contained increased levels of cytokines that are produced in response to CXCL1 (the functional mouse homolog of IL8, also called KC). Serum from obese patients caused organoids from L2-IL1B/IL8 mice to produce IL8. BE tissues from L2-IL1B mice fed the HFD and from L2-IL1B/IL8 mice contained increased numbers of myeloid cells and cells expressing Cxcr2 and Lgr5 messenger RNAs (epithelial progenitors) compared with mice fed control diets. BE tissues from L2-IL1B mice raised in germ-free housing had fewer progenitor cells and developed less dysplasia than in L2-IL1 mice raised under standard conditions; exposure of fecal microbiota from L2-IL1B mice fed the HFD to L2-IL1B mice fed the control diet accelerated tumor development.                In a mouse model of BE, we found that an HFD promoted dysplasia by altering the esophageal microenvironment and gut microbiome, thereby inducing inflammation and stem cell expansion, independent of obesity.

32989144        	Driver mutations of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence govern the intestinal epithelial global translational capacity.            	Deregulated global mRNA translation is an emerging feature of cancer cells. Oncogenic transformation in colorectal cancer (CRC) is driven by mutations in APC, KRAS, SMAD4, and TP53, known as the adenoma-carcinoma sequence (ACS). Here we introduce each of these driver mutations into intestinal organoids to show that they are modulators of global translational capacity in intestinal epithelial cells. Increased global translation resulting from loss of Apc expression was potentiated by the presence of oncogenic Kras                        G12D                     Knockdown of Smad4 further enhanced global translation efficiency and was associated with a lower 4E-BP1-to-eIF4E ratio. Quadruple mutant cells with additional P53 loss displayed the highest global translational capacity, paralleled by high proliferation and growth rates, indicating that the proteome is heavily geared toward cell division. Transcriptional reprogramming facilitating global translation included elevated ribogenesis and activation of mTORC1 signaling. Accordingly, interfering with the mTORC1/4E-BP/eIF4E axis inhibited the growth potential endowed by accumulation of multiple drivers. In conclusion, the ACS is characterized by a strongly altered global translational landscape in epithelial cells, exposing a therapeutic potential for direct targeting of the translational apparatus.	
27566565        	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and nuclear β-catenin induced by conditional intestinal disruption of Cdh1 with Apc is E-cadherin EC1 domain dependent.            	Two important protein-protein interactions establish E-cadherin (Cdh1) in the adhesion complex; homophilic binding via the extra-cellular (EC1) domain and cytoplasmic tail binding to β-catenin. Here, we evaluate whether E-cadherin binding can inhibit β-catenin when there is loss of Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) from the β-catenin destruction complex. Combined conditional loss of Cdh1 and Apc were generated in the intestine, intestinal adenoma and adenoma organoids. Combined intestinal disruption (Cdh1fl/flApcfl/flVil-CreERT2) resulted in lethality, breakdown of the intestinal barrier, increased Wnt target gene expression and increased nuclear β-catenin localization, suggesting that E-cadherin inhibits β-catenin. Combination with an intestinal stem cell Cre (Lgr5CreERT2) resulted in ApcΔ/Δ recombination and adenoma, but intact Cdh1fl/fl alleles. Cultured ApcΔ/ΔCdh1fl/fl adenoma cells infected with adenovirus-Cre induced Cdh1fl/fl recombination (Cdh1Δ/Δ), disruption of organoid morphology, nuclear β-catenin localization, and cells with an epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype. Complementation with adenovirus expressing wild-type Cdh1 (Cdh1-WT) rescued adhesion and β-catenin membrane localization, yet an EC1 specific double mutant defective in homophilic adhesion (Cdh1-MutW2A, S78W) did not. These data suggest that E-cadherin inhibits β-catenin in the context of disruption of the APC-destruction complex, and that this function is also EC1 domain dependent. Both binding functions of E-cadherin may be required for its tumour suppressor activity.	
30623107        	Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2 stabilizes Epcam and maintains epithelial organization in the mouse intestine.            	Mutations in SPINT2 encoding the epithelial serine protease inhibitor hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2 (HAI-2) are associated with congenital tufting enteropathy. However, the functions of HAI-2 in vivo are poorly understood. Here we used tamoxifen-induced Cre-LoxP recombination in mice to ablate Spint2. Mice lacking Spint2 died within 6 days after initiating tamoxifen treatment and showed severe epithelial damage in the whole intestinal tracts, and, to a lesser extent, the extrahepatic bile duct. The intestinal epithelium showed enhanced exfoliation, villous atrophy, enterocyte tufts and elongated crypts. Organoid crypt culture indicated that Spint2 ablation induced Epcam cleavage with decreased claudin-7 levels and resulted in organoid rupture. These organoid changes could be rescued by addition of serine protease inhibitors aprotinin, camostat mesilate and matriptase-selective α-ketobenzothiazole as well as by co-deletion of Prss8, encoding the serine protease prostasin. These results indicate that HAI-2 is an essential cellular inhibitor for maintaining intestinal epithelium architecture.	
31462798        	Metastatic-niche labelling reveals parenchymal cells with stem features.            	Direct investigation of the early cellular changes induced by metastatic cells within the surrounding tissue remains a challenge. Here we present a system in which metastatic cancer cells release a cell-penetrating fluorescent protein, which is taken up by neighbouring cells and enables spatial identification of the local metastatic cellular environment. Using this system, tissue cells with low representation in the metastatic niche can be identified and characterized within the bulk tissue. To highlight its potential, we applied this strategy to study the cellular environment of metastatic breast cancer cells in the lung. We report the presence of cancer-associated parenchymal cells, which exhibit stem-cell-like features, expression of lung progenitor markers, multi-lineage differentiation potential and self-renewal activity. In ex vivo assays, lung epithelial cells acquire a cancer-associated parenchymal-cell-like phenotype when co-cultured with cancer cells and support their growth. These results highlight the potential of this method as a platform for new discoveries.	
31390564        	Expansion of Luminal Progenitor Cells in the Aging Mouse and Human Prostate.            	Aging is associated with loss of tissue mass and a decline in adult stem cell function in many tissues. In contrast, aging in the prostate is associated with growth-related diseases including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Surprisingly, the effects of aging on prostate epithelial cells have not been established. Here we find that organoid-forming progenitor activity of mouse prostate basal and luminal cells is maintained with age. This is caused by an age-related expansion of progenitor-like luminal cells that share features with human prostate luminal progenitor cells. The increase in luminal progenitor cells may contribute to greater risk for growth-related disease in the aging prostate. Importantly, we demonstrate expansion of human luminal progenitor cells in BPH. In summary, we define a Trop2+ luminal progenitor subset and identify an age-related shift in the luminal compartment of the mouse and human prostate epithelium.

31585123        	Mouse Models of Human Gastric Cancer Subtypes With Stomach-Specific CreERT2-Mediated Pathway Alterations.            	Patterns of genetic alterations characterize different molecular subtypes of human gastric cancer. We aimed to establish mouse models of these subtypes.                We searched databases to identify genes with unique expression in the stomach epithelium, resulting in the identification of Anxa10. We generated mice with tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreERT2) in the Anxa10 gene locus. We created 3 mouse models with alterations in pathways that characterize the chromosomal instability (CIN) and the genomically stable (GS) subtypes of human gastric cancer: Anxa10-CreERT2;KrasG12D/+;Tp53R172H/+;Smad4fl/f (CIN mice), Anxa10-CreERT2;Cdh1fl/fl;KrasG12D/+;Smad4fl/fl (GS-TGBF mice), and Anxa10-CreERT2;Cdh1fl/fl;KrasG12D/+;Apcfl/fl (GS-Wnt mice). We analyzed tumors that developed in these mice by histology for cell types and metastatic potential. We derived organoids from the tumors and tested their response to chemotherapeutic agents and the epithelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway inhibitor trametinib.                The gastric tumors from the CIN mice had an invasive phenotype and formed liver and lung metastases. The tumor cells had a glandular morphology, similar to human intestinal-type gastric cancer. The gastric tumors from the GS-TGFB mice were poorly differentiated with diffuse morphology and signet ring cells, resembling human diffuse-type gastric cancer. Cells from these tumors were invasive, and mice developed peritoneal carcinomatosis and lung metastases. GS-Wnt mice developed adenomatous tooth-like gastric cancer. Organoids derived from tumors of GS-TGBF and GS-Wnt mice were more resistant to docetaxel, whereas organoids from the CIN tumors were more resistant to trametinib.                Using a stomach-specific CreERT2 system, we created mice that develop tumors with morphologic similarities to subtypes of human gastric cancer. These tumors have different patterns of local growth, metastasis, and response to therapeutic agents. They can be used to study different subtypes of human gastric cancer.

29202479        	SPOP mutation drives prostate neoplasia without stabilizing oncogenic transcription factor ERG.            	Nearly 50% of prostate cancers harbor gene fusions that lead to overexpression of the transcription factor ERG, while a mutually exclusive 10% of prostate cancers harbor recurrent mutations in the gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase SPOP. Recent reports suggest that SPOP acts as a ubiquitin ligase for ERG and propose that ERG stabilization is the oncogenic effector of SPOP mutation. Here, we used human prostate cancer samples and showed that the vast majority of human SPOP-mutant cancers do not express ERG. Comparison of SPOP-mutant and ERG-fusion organoid models showed evidence of divergent, rather than common, transcriptional programs. Furthermore, expression of prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations in genetically engineered mouse models of SPOP-mutant prostate cancer did not result in the expression of ERG protein in histologically normal prostate glands, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive adenocarcinoma, or prostate organoids. In summary, we found no evidence that ERG is an effector of SPOP mutation in human prostate cancer or mouse models.	
30572959        	Novel role of miR-133a-3p in repressing gastric cancer growth and metastasis via blocking autophagy-mediated glutaminolysis.            	Autophagy plays a crucial role in sustaining the homeostasis in various malignant diseases. It has also been reported to promote tumor development in multiple cancers. Glutaminolysis instead of Warburg Effect produce adequate ATP and provide nitrogen and carbon to replenish the TCA cycle which has been discovered to be a new energy source for tumor cells recently. By means of degrading intracellular particles including amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids, sugars and aged organisms, autophagy can recycle the aforementioned particles into bioenergetics and biosynthesis pathways, finally favoring tumor cells. MicroRNA is a kind of noncoding RNA that regulates the targeting gene expression mostly at post-transcription level. Among these miRNAs, microRNA-133a-3p is reported to be a tumor suppressor in numerous cancers.                We characterized the down-regulated expression level of microRNA-133a-3p in gastric cancer via TCGA database. Subsequently, we verified the tumor suppressor role of microRNA-133a-3p in gastric cancer cells through a series biological function assay. We used immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscope to observe the negative effect of microRNA-133a-3p on autophagy and used dual-luciferase report assay to identify the candidate gene GABARAPL1 of microRNA-133A-3p.Then we used high performance liquid phase mass spectrometry and seahorse analysis to detect whether miR-133a-3p could block the glutaminolysis metabolism through autophagy. At last, we confirmed the tumor suppressor role of microRNA-133a-3p in vivo on PDX mice model.                We demonstrated that microRNA-133a-3p overexpression could block the activation of autophagy to ruin the abnormal glutaminolysis and further inhibit the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. We successfully proved gastric cancer cells can replenish glutaminolysis via autophagy and microRNA-133a-3p could block aforementioned pathway by targeting core autophagy participants GABARAPL1 and ATG13.We then verified the negative function of microRNA-133a-3p on autophagy-mediated glutaminolysis both in PDX model and human gastric cancer organoid model.                MicroRNA-133a-3p targets GABARAPL1 to block autophagy-mediated glutaminolysis, further repressing gastric cancer growth and metastasis.	
30683454        	Editorial: Basic research in bladder cancer - refining the tools. 3rd IBCN seminars series1.            	This editorial highlights submissions to part II of the 3rd IBCN Seminars Series particularly focusing on the tools required for conduction of translational research in bladder cancer. One of the submissions describe the ex vivo culture of primary tumor cells from N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced bladder tumors in rats and subsequent establishment of an immortalized cell line. In a next step the authors thoroughly characterize this cell line. They conclude that differentiation marker expression patterns observed in the original tumors are largely retained in the spheroids. Although new cancer models, such as organoid tissue cultures, hold great promise for studying cancer progression and might have a potential for development and selection of an optimal treatment, their limitations must be kept in mind. The second submission, therefore, critically questions the current role of organoid tissue culture as a predictive tool in urothelial cancer patients. The third manuscript of this series provides a broader overview of post-translational modification in bladder cancer is presented and how PTMs can be exploited as potential therapeutic targets. The 3 manuscripts featured in this issue demonstrate especially how basic research is being channeled to inform clinically actionable discoveries.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

30232224        	A Phase II Trial of the Aurora Kinase A Inhibitor Alisertib for Patients with Castration-resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Efficacy and Biomarkers.            	Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer that may develop de novo or as a mechanism of treatment resistance. N-myc is capable of driving NEPC progression. Alisertib inhibits the interaction between N-myc and its stabilizing factor Aurora-A, inhibiting N-myc signaling, and suppressing tumor growth.                Sixty men were treated with alisertib 50 mg twice daily for 7 days every 21 days. Eligibility included metastatic prostate cancer and at least one: small-cell neuroendocrine morphology; ≥50% neuroendocrine marker expression; new liver metastases without PSA progression; or elevated serum neuroendocrine markers. The primary endpoint was 6-month radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Pretreatment biopsies were evaluated by whole exome and RNA-seq and patient-derived organoids were developed.                Median PSA was 1.13 ng/mL (0.01-514.2), number of prior therapies was 3, and 68% had visceral metastases. Genomic alterations involved RB1 (55%), TP53 (46%), PTEN (29%), BRCA2 (29%), and AR (27%), and there was a range of androgen receptor signaling and NEPC marker expression. Six-month rPFS was 13.4% and median overall survival was 9.5 months (7.3-13). Exceptional responders were identified, including complete resolution of liver metastases and prolonged stable disease, with tumors suggestive of N-myc and Aurora-A overactivity. Patient organoids exhibited concordant responses to alisertib and allowed for the dynamic testing of Aurora-N-myc complex disruption.                Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, a subset of patients with advanced prostate cancer and molecular features supporting Aurora-A and N-myc activation achieved significant clinical benefit from single-agent alisertib.                ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

28600348        	Loss of the Wnt receptor frizzled 7 in the mouse gastric epithelium is deleterious and triggers rapid repopulation in vivo.            	The gastric epithelium consists of tubular glandular units, each containing several differentiated cell types, and populations of stem cells, which enable the stomach to secrete the acid, mucus and various digestive enzymes required for its function. Very little is known about which cell signalling pathways are required for homeostasis of the gastric epithelium. Many diseases, such as cancer, arise as a result of deregulation of signalling pathways that regulate homeostasis of the diseased organ. Therefore, it is important to understand the biology of how normal conditions are maintained in a tissue to help inform the mechanisms driving disease in that same tissue, and to identify potential points of therapeutic intervention. Wnt signalling regulates several cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation and migration, and plays a crucial role during homeostasis of several tissues, including the intestinal epithelium. Wnt3a is required in the culture medium of gastric organoids, suggesting it is also important for the homeostasis of the gastric epithelium, but this has not been investigated in vivo Here, we show that the Wnt receptor frizzled 7 (Fzd7), which is required for the homeostasis of the intestine, is expressed in the gastric epithelium and is required for gastric organoid growth. Gastric-specific loss of Fzd7 in the adult gastric epithelium of mice is deleterious and triggers rapid epithelial repopulation, which we believe is the first observation of this novel function for this tissue. Taken together, these data provide functional evidence of a crucial role for Wnt signalling, via the Fzd7 receptor, during homeostasis of the gastric epithelium.                © 2017.

32633781        	SOAT1 promotes mevalonate pathway dependency in pancreatic cancer.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis, and new therapies are needed. Altered metabolism is a cancer vulnerability, and several metabolic pathways have been shown to promote PDAC. However, the changes in cholesterol metabolism and their role during PDAC progression remain largely unknown. Here we used organoid and mouse models to determine the drivers of altered cholesterol metabolism in PDAC and the consequences of its disruption on tumor progression. We identified sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) as a key player in sustaining the mevalonate pathway by converting cholesterol to inert cholesterol esters, thereby preventing the negative feedback elicited by unesterified cholesterol. Genetic targeting of Soat1 impairs cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo and reveals a mevalonate pathway dependency in p53 mutant PDAC cells that have undergone p53 loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In contrast, pancreatic organoids lacking p53 mutation and p53 LOH are insensitive to SOAT1 loss, indicating a potential therapeutic window for inhibiting SOAT1 in PDAC.                © 2020 Oni et al.	
26295972        	Colorectal cancer models for novel drug discovery.            	Despite increased screening rates and advances in targeted therapy, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. CRC models that recapitulate key features of human disease are essential to the development of novel and effective therapeutics. Classic methods of modeling CRC such as human cell lines and xenograft mice, while useful for many applications, carry significant limitations. Recently developed in vitro and in vivo models overcome some of these deficiencies and thus can be utilized to better model CRC for mechanistic and translational research.                The authors review established models of in vitro cell culture and describe advances in organoid culture for studying normal and malignant intestine. They also discuss key features of classic xenograft models and describe other approaches for in vivo CRC research, including patient-derived xenograft, carcinogen-induced, orthotopic transplantation and transgenic mouse models. We also describe mouse models of metastatic CRC.                No single model is optimal for drug discovery in CRC. Genetically engineered models overcome many limitations of xenograft models. Three-dimensional organoids can be efficiently derived from both normal and malignant tissue for large-scale in vitro and in vivo (transplantation) studies and are thus a significant advance in CRC drug discovery.	
25435379        	A 3D tension bioreactor platform to study the interplay between ECM stiffness and tumor phenotype.            	Extracellular matrix (ECM) structure, composition, and stiffness have profound effects on tissue development and pathologies such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Accordingly, a variety of synthetic hydrogel systems have been designed to study the impact of ECM composition, density, mechanics, and topography on cell and tissue phenotype. However, these synthetic systems fail to accurately recapitulate the biological properties and structure of the native tissue ECM. Natural three dimensional (3D) ECM hydrogels, such as collagen or hyaluronic acid, feature many of the chemical and physical properties of tissue, yet, these systems have limitations including the inability to independently control biophysical properties such as stiffness and pore size. Here, we present a 3D tension bioreactor system that permits precise mechanical tuning of collagen hydrogel stiffness, while maintaining consistent composition and pore size. We achieve this by mechanically loading collagen hydrogels covalently-conjugated to a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane to induce hydrogel stiffening. We validated the biological application of this system with oncogenically transformed mammary epithelial cell organoids embedded in a 3D collagen I hydrogel, either uniformly stiffened or calibrated to create a gradient of ECM stiffening, to visually demonstrate the impact of ECM stiffening on transformation and tumor cell invasion. As such, this bioreactor presents the first tunable 3D natural hydrogel system that is capable of independently assessing the role of ECM stiffness on tissue phenotype.

30664649        	Anti-LRP5/6 VHHs promote differentiation of Wnt-hypersensitive intestinal stem cells.            	Wnt-induced β-catenin-mediated transcription is a driving force for stem cell self-renewal during adult tissue homeostasis. Enhanced Wnt receptor expression due to mutational inactivation of the ubiquitin ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 recently emerged as a leading cause for cancer development. Consequently, targeting canonical Wnt receptors such as LRP5/6 holds great promise for treatment of such cancer subsets. Here, we employ CIS display technology to identify single-domain antibody fragments (VHH) that bind the LRP6 P3E3P4E4 region with nanomolar affinity and strongly inhibit Wnt3/3a-induced β-catenin-mediated transcription in cells, while leaving Wnt1 responses unaffected. Structural analysis reveal that individual VHHs variably employ divergent antigen-binding regions to bind a similar surface in the third β-propeller of LRP5/6, sterically interfering with Wnt3/3a binding. Importantly, anti-LRP5/6 VHHs block the growth of Wnt-hypersensitive Rnf43/Znrf3-mutant intestinal organoids through stem cell exhaustion and collective terminal differentiation. Thus, VHH-mediated targeting of LRP5/6 provides a promising differentiation-inducing strategy for treatment of Wnt-hypersensitive tumors.	
31605540        	A mutant KRAS-induced factor REG4 promotes cancer stem cell properties via Wnt/β-catenin signaling.            	Mutant KRAS provides a driving force for enhancement of cancer stem cells (CSCs) characteristics contributing transformation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells harboring adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations. Here, we identified the factors mediating the promotion of CSCs properties induced by KRAS mutation through microarray analyses of genes specifically induced in CRC spheroids harboring both KRAS and APC mutations. Among them, REG4 was identified as a key factor since CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of REG4 most significantly affected the stem cell characteristics in which CSCs markers were effectively suppressed. We show that REG4 mediates promotion of CSCs properties via Wnt/β-catenin signaling in various in vitro studies including tumor organoid systems. Furthermore, expression patterns of CSCs markers and REG4 correlated in intestinal tumors from Apcmin/+ /KrasG12D LA2 mice and in CRC patient tissues harboring both KRAS and APC mutations. The role of REG4 in the tumor-initiating capacity accompanied by enhancement of CSCs characteristics was also revealed by NSG mice xenograft system. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of REG4 in promoting CSCs properties induced by KRAS mutation, and provides a new therapeutic strategy for CRC harboring both APC and KRAS mutations.                © 2019 UICC.	
27292189        	Secreted Phospholipases A2 Are Intestinal Stem Cell Niche Factors with Distinct Roles in Homeostasis, Inflammation, and Cancer.            	The intestinal stem cell niche provides cues that actively maintain gut homeostasis. Dysregulation of these cues may compromise intestinal regeneration upon tissue insult and/or promote tumor growth. Here, we identify secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) as stem cell niche factors with context-dependent functions in the digestive tract. We show that group IIA sPLA2, a known genetic modifier of mouse intestinal tumorigenesis, is expressed by Paneth cells in the small intestine, while group X sPLA2 is expressed by Paneth/goblet-like cells in the colon. During homeostasis, group IIA/X sPLA2s inhibit Wnt signaling through intracellular activation of Yap1. However, upon inflammation they are secreted into the intestinal lumen, where they promote prostaglandin synthesis and Wnt signaling. Genetic ablation of both sPLA2s improves recovery from inflammation but increases colon cancer susceptibility due to release of their homeostatic Wnt-inhibitory role. This "trade-off" effect suggests sPLA2s have important functions as genetic modifiers of inflammation and colon cancer.                Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
33247285        	Antigen retrieval and clearing for whole-organ immunofluorescence by FLASH.            	Advances in light-sheet and confocal microscopy now allow imaging of cleared large biological tissue samples and enable the 3D appreciation of cell and protein localization in their native organ environment. However, the sample preparations for such imaging are often onerous, and their capability for antigen detection is limited. Here, we describe FLASH (fast light-microscopic analysis of antibody-stained whole organs), a simple, rapid, fully customizable technique for molecular phenotyping of intact tissue volumes. FLASH utilizes non-degradative epitope recovery and membrane solubilization to enable the detection of a multitude of membranous, cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens in whole mouse organs and embryos, human biopsies, organoids and Drosophila. Retrieval and immunolabeling of epithelial markers, an obstacle for previous clearing techniques, can be achieved with FLASH. Upon volumetric imaging, FLASH-processed samples preserve their architecture and integrity and can be paraffin-embedded for subsequent histopathological analysis. The technique can be performed by scientists trained in light microscopy and yields results in <1 week.	
30733230        	C8orf76 Promotes Gastric Tumorigenicity and Metastasis by Directly Inducing lncRNA DUSP5P1 and Associates with Patient Outcomes.            	We identified for the first time that C8orf76 (chromosome 8 open reading frame 76) is preferentially amplified in gastric cancer. We elucidated its role and clinical significance in gastric carcinogenesis.                The clinical impact of C8orf76 was assessed in 592 patients with gastric cancer. The biological function of C8orf76 was studied in vitro, in vivo, and in gastric cancer patient-derived organoid models. C8orf76 downstream effector and pathways were identified by RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, luciferase reporter, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay.                C8orf76 was upregulated in 69.74% and 65.71% of two independent cohorts of gastric cancers and was positively associated with C8orf76 amplification. Multivariate analysis showed that gastric cancer patients with C8orf76 amplification (cohort I, n = 129; cohort II, n = 107) or overexpression (n = 356) had a significantly shortened survival. C8orf76 significantly promoted gastric cancer cell proliferation, cell-cycle transformation, and migration/invasion, but suppressed cell apoptosis. Silencing C8orf76 expression exerted opposite effects in vitro and significantly inhibited xenograft tumor growth, lung metastasis, and liver metastasis in nude mice. Silencing C8orf76 also significantly suppressed the growth of patient-derived organoids. Mechanically, C8orf76 activated MAPK/ERK signaling cascade. C8orf76 directly bound to the promoter region of lncRNA dual specificity phosphatase 5 pseudogene 1 (DUSP5P1) with a binding motif of AGGCTG and activated DUSP5P1 transcription. DUSP5P1 induced MAPK/ERK signaling and promoted gastric tumorigenesis. Knockdown DUSP5P1 abrogated the effect of C8orf76 in activating MAPK/ERK cascade and the tumor-promoting function.                C8orf76 directly binds to oncogenic lncRNA DUSP5P1 to induce its expression and activates MAPK signaling. C8orf76 plays a pivotal oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis and is an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer patients.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
28404908        	Verteporfin exhibits YAP-independent anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects in endometrial cancer cells.            	Endometrial Carcinoma (EMCA) is the most common gynecologic malignancy and the fourth most common malignancy in women in the United States. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a potent transcription coactivator acting via binding to the TEAD transcription factor, and plays a critical role in organ size regulation. Verteporfin (VP), a benzoporphyrin derivative, was identified as an inhibitor of YAP-TEAD interaction. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of VP in EMCA. The efficacy of VP on cell viability, cytotoxicity and invasion was assayed in EMCA cell lines. An organoid model system was also developed to test the effect of VP on apoptotic markers in an in vitro model system. Treatment with VP resulted in a decrease in cell viability, invasion and an increase in cytotoxicity of EMCA cells. These effects occurred as early as 15 minutes following treatment. Similarly, VP treatment versus vehicle control increased apoptosis in human organoid model systems. Quantitative RT-PCR, cDNA based RTPCR array analysis and western blotting were performed to investigate the mechanism of VP action. The cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects appeared to be independent of its effect on YAP. Our results suggest that VP is a promising chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of endometrial cancer.	
26287467        	Single-cell messenger RNA sequencing reveals rare intestinal cell types.            	Understanding the development and function of an organ requires the characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating subpopulations of cells are based on messenger RNA or protein expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells, is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected cells from mouse intestinal organoids, cultured self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at widely different abundances. Since available computational methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type identification in complex populations of single cells. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of hormone-producing intestinal cells. Next, we use Reg4 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells. We envision broad applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased organs.

33650026        	Gene Editing Rescues In vitro T Cell Development of RAG2-Deficient Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells in an Artificial Thymic Organoid System.            	Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) caused by RAG1 or RAG2 deficiency is a genetically determined immune deficiency characterized by the virtual absence of T and B lymphocytes. Unless treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), patients with RAG deficiency succumb to severe infections early in life. However, HSCT carries the risk of graft-versus-host disease. Moreover, a high rate of graft failure and poor immune reconstitution have been reported after unconditioned HSCT. Expression of the RAG genes is tightly regulated, and preclinical attempts of gene therapy with heterologous promoters have led to controversial results. Using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an in vitro artificial thymic organoid system as a model, here we demonstrate that gene editing rescues the progressive T cell differentiation potential of RAG2-deficient cells to normal levels, with generation of a diversified T cell repertoire. These results suggest that targeted gene editing may represent a novel therapeutic option for correction of this immunodeficiency.	
31879358        	TRPS1 acts as a context-dependent regulator of mammary epithelial cell growth/differentiation and breast cancer development.            	The GATA-type zinc finger transcription factor TRPS1 has been implicated in breast cancer. However, its precise role remains unclear, as both amplifications and inactivating mutations in TRPS1 have been reported. Here, we used in vitro and in vivo loss-of-function approaches to dissect the role of TRPS1 in mammary gland development and invasive lobular breast carcinoma, which is hallmarked by functional loss of E-cadherin. We show that TRPS1 is essential in mammary epithelial cells, since TRPS1-mediated suppression of interferon signaling promotes in vitro proliferation and lactogenic differentiation. Similarly, TRPS1 expression is indispensable for proliferation of mammary organoids and in vivo survival of luminal epithelial cells during mammary gland development. However, the consequences of TRPS1 loss are dependent on E-cadherin status, as combined inactivation of E-cadherin and TRPS1 causes persistent proliferation of mammary organoids and accelerated mammary tumor formation in mice. Together, our results demonstrate that TRPS1 can function as a context-dependent tumor suppressor in breast cancer, while being essential for growth and differentiation of normal mammary epithelial cells.                © 2020 Cornelissen et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
28342759        	Activation of Epithelial Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 by Interleukin 28 Controls Mucosal Healing in Mice With Colitis and Is Increased in Mucosa of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.            	We investigated the roles of interleukin 28A (also called IL28A or interferon λ2) in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) activation, studying its effects in mouse models of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and intestinal mucosal healing.                Colitis was induced in C57BL/6JCrl mice (controls), mice with IEC-specific disruption of Stat1 (Stat1IEC-KO), mice with disruption of the interferon λ receptor 1 gene (Il28ra-/-), and mice with disruption of the interferon regulatory factor 3 gene (Irf3-/-), with or without disruption of Irf7 (Irf7-/-). We used high-resolution mini-endoscopy and in vivo imaging methods to assess colitis progression. We used 3-dimensional small intestine and colon organoids, along with RNA-Seq and gene ontology methods, to characterize the effects of IL28 on primary IECs. We studied the effects of IL28 on the human intestinal cancer cell line Caco-2 in a wound-healing assay, and in mice colon wounds. Colonic biopsies and resected tissue from patients with IBD (n = 62) and patients without colon inflammation (controls, n = 23) were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain rection to measure expression of IL28A, IL28RA, and other related cytokines; biopsy samples were also analyzed by immunofluorescence to identify sources of IL28 production. IECs were isolated from patient tissues and incubated with IL28; signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation was measured by immunoblots and confocal imaging.                Lamina propria cells in colon tissues of patients with IBD, and mice with colitis, had increased expression of IL28 compared with controls; levels of IL28R were increased in the colonic epithelium of patients with IBD and mice with colitis. Administration of IL28 induced phosphorylation of STAT1 in primary human and mouse IECs, increasing with dose. Il28ra-/-, Irf3-/-, Irf3-/-Irf7-/-, as well as Stat1IEC-KO mice, developed more severe colitis after administration of dextran sulfate sodium than control mice, with reduced epithelial restitution. Il28ra-/- and Stat1IEC-KO mice also developed more severe colitis in response to oxazolone than control mice. We found IL28 to induce phosphorylation (activation) of STAT1 in epithelial cells, leading to their proliferation in organoid culture. Administration of IL28 to mice with induced colonic wounds promoted mucosal healing.                IL28 controls proliferation of IECs in mice with colitis and accelerates mucosal healing by activating STAT1. IL28 might be developed as a therapeutic agent for patients with IBD.

31842277        	An Effective Multi-Stage Liposomal DNA Origami Nanosystem for In Vivo Cancer Therapy.            	DNA origami systems could be important candidates for clinical applications. Unfortunately, their intrinsic properties such as the activation of non-specific immune system responses leading to inflammation, instability in physiological solutions, and a short in vivo lifetime are the major challenges for real world applications. A compact short tube DNA origami (STDO) of 30 nm in length and 10 nm in width was designed to fit inside the core of a stealth liposome (LSTDO) of about 150 nm to remote load doxorubicin. Biocompatibility was tested in three-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures and in vivo. Efficacy was evaluated in different cell lines and in a xenograft breast cancer mouse model. As described in a previous work, LSTDO is highly stable and biocompatible, escaping the recognition of the immune system. Here we show that LSTDO have an increased toleration in mouse liver organoids used as an ex vivo model that recapitulate the tissue of origin. This innovative drug delivery system (DDS) improves the antitumoral efficacy and biodistribution of doxorubicin in tumor-bearing mice and decreases bone marrow toxicity. Our application is an attractive system for the remote loading of other drugs able to interact with DNA for the preparation of liposomal formulations.	
32225170        	CSN6-TRIM21 axis instigates cancer stemness during tumorigenesis.            	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumour initiation, metastasis and recurrence. However, the mechanism of CSC formation, maintenance and expansion in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly characterised.                The role of COP9 signalosome subunit 6 (CSN6) in regulating cancer stemness was evaluated by organoid formation and limited dilution analysis. The role of CSN6-TRIM21-OCT1-ALDH1A1 axis in CSC formation was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The association of CSN6, TRIM21 and ALDH1A1 expression was validated by a tissue microarray with 267 CRC patients.                The results showed that CSN6 is critical for sphere formation and maintaining the growth of patient-derived organoids (PDOs). We characterised the role of CSN6 in regulating cancer stemness, which involves the TRIM21 E3 ubiquitin ligase, transcription factor POU class 2 homeobox 1 (OCT1) and cancer stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 A1 (ALDH1A1). Our data showed that CSN6 facilitates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TRIM21, which in turn decreases TRIM21-mediated OCT1 ubiquitination and subsequently stabilises OCT1. Consequently, OCT1 stabilisation leads to ALDH1A1expression and promotes cancer stemness. We further showed that the protein expression levels of CSN6, TRIM21 and ALDH1A1 can serve as prognostic markers for human CRC.                In conclusion, we validate a pathway for cancer stemness regulation involving ALDH1A1 levels through the CSN6-TRIM21 axis, which may be utilised as CRC molecular markers and be targeted for therapeutic intervention in cancers.	
31554261        	Unraveling Heterogeneity in Epithelial Cell Fates of the Mammary Gland and Breast Cancer.            	Fluidity in cell fate or heterogeneity in cell identity is an interesting cell biological phenomenon, which at the same time poses a significant obstacle for cancer therapy. The mammary gland seems a relatively straightforward organ with stromal cells and basal- and luminal- epithelial cell types. In reality, the epithelial cell fates are much more complex and heterogeneous, which is the topic of this review. Part of the complexity comes from the dynamic nature of this organ: the primitive epithelial tree undergoes extensively remodeling and expansion during puberty, pregnancy, and lactation and, unlike most other organs, the bulk of mammary gland development occurs late, during puberty. An active cell biological debate has focused on lineage commitment to basal- and luminal- epithelial cell fates by epithelial progenitor and stem cells; processes that are also relevant to cancer biology. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of heterogeneity in mammary gland and recent insights obtained through lineage tracing, signaling assays, and organoid cultures. Lastly, we relate these insights to cancer and ongoing efforts to resolve heterogeneity in breast cancer with single-cell RNAseq approaches.	
33570127        	Overexpression of Cancer-Associated Stem Cell Gene OLFM4 in the Colonic Epithelium of Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.            	To examine immune-epithelial interactions and their impact on epithelial transformation in primary sclerosing cholangitis-associated ulcerative colitis (PSC-UC) using patient-derived colonic epithelial organoid cultures (EpOCs).                The EpOCs were originated from colonic biopsies from patients with PSC-UC (n = 12), patients with UC (n = 14), and control patients (n = 10) and stimulated with cytokines previously associated with intestinal inflammation (interferon (IFN) γ and interleukin (IL)-22). Markers of cytokine downstream pathways, stemness, and pluripotency were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. The OLFM4 expression in situ was assessed by RNAscope and immunohistochemistry.                A distinct expression of stem cell-associated genes was observed in EpOCs derived from patients with PSC-UC, with lower expression of the classical stem-cell marker LGR5 and overexpression of OLFM4, previously associated with pluripotency and early stages of neoplastic transformation in the gastrointestinal and biliary tracts. High levels of OLFM4 were also found ex vivo in colonic biopsies from patients with PSC-UC. In addition, IFNγ stimulation resulted in the downregulation of LGR5 in EpOCs, whereas higher expression of OLFM4 was observed after IL-22 stimulation. Interestingly, expression of the IL-22 receptor, IL22RA1, was induced by IFNγ, suggesting that a complex interplay between these cytokines may contribute to carcinogenesis in PSC-UC.                Higher expression of OLFM4, a cancer stemness gene induced by IL-22, is present in PSC-UC, suggesting that IL-22 responses may result in alterations of the intestinal stem-cell niche in these patients.                © 2021 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

32039208        	'Omics Approaches to Explore the Breast Cancer Landscape.            	Breast cancer incidence is increasing worldwide with more than 600,000 deaths reported in 2018 alone. In current practice treatment options for breast cancer patients consists of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or targeting of classical markers of breast cancer subtype: estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2. However, these treatments fail to prevent recurrence and metastasis. Improved understanding of breast cancer and metastasis biology will help uncover novel biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities to improve patient stratification and treatment. We will first provide an overview of current methods and models used to study breast cancer biology, focusing on 2D and 3D cell culture, including organoids, and on in vivo models such as the MMTV mouse model and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Next, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches and their integration will be considered in the context of breast cancer susceptibility, breast cancer drivers, and therapeutic response and resistance to treatment. Finally, we will discuss how 'Omics datasets in combination with traditional breast cancer models are useful for generating insights into breast cancer biology, for suggesting individual treatments in precision oncology, and for creating data repositories to undergo further meta-analysis. System biology has the potential to catalyze the next great leap forward in treatment options for breast cancer patients.                Copyright © 2020 Parsons and Francavilla.	
31717887        	Conditional Reprogramming for Patient-Derived Cancer Models and Next-Generation Living Biobanks.            	Traditional cancer models including cell lines and animal models have limited applications in both basic and clinical cancer research. Genomics-based precision oncology only help 2-20% patients with solid cancer. Functional diagnostics and patient-derived cancer models are needed for precision cancer biology. In this review, we will summarize applications of conditional cell reprogramming (CR) in cancer research and next generation living biobanks (NGLB). Together with organoids, CR has been cited in two NCI (National Cancer Institute, USA) programs (PDMR: patient-derived cancer model repository; HCMI: human cancer model initiatives. HCMI will be distributed through ATCC). Briefly, the CR method is a simple co-culture technology with a Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, in combination with fibroblast feeder cells, which allows us to rapidly expand both normal and malignant epithelial cells from diverse anatomic sites and mammalian species and does not require transfection with exogenous viral or cellular genes. Establishment of CR cells from both normal and tumor tissue is highly efficient. The robust nature of the technique is exemplified by the ability to produce 2 × 106 cells in five days from a core biopsy of tumor tissue. Normal CR cell cultures retain a normal karyotype and differentiation potential and CR cells derived from tumors retain their tumorigenic phenotype. CR also allows us to enrich cancer cells from urine (for bladder cancer), blood (for prostate cancer), and pleural effusion (for non-small cell lung carcinoma). The ability to produce inexhaustible cell populations using CR technology from small biopsies and cryopreserved specimens has the potential to transform biobanking repositories (NGLB: next-generation living biobank) and current pathology practice by enabling genetic, biochemical, metabolomic, proteomic, and biological assays, including chemosensitivity testing as a functional diagnostics tool for precision cancer medicine. We discussed analyses of patient-derived matched normal and tumor models using a case with tongue squamous cell carcinoma as an example. Last, we summarized applications in cancer research, disease modeling, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine of CR-based NGLB.

30181548        	Dedifferentiation process driven by TGF-beta signaling enhances stem cell properties in human colorectal cancer.            	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) possess the capacity for self-renewal and the potential to differentiate into non-CSCs. The recent discoveries of dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and non-CSCs revealed the significance of acquiring CSC-like properties in non-CSCs as an important process in progression of cancer. The mechanism underlying acquisition of CSC-like properties has mainly been investigated in the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Here, we demonstrate the dedifferentiation process may be an alternative mechanism in acquisition of CSC-like properties in human colorectal cancer cells. By exploring the single-cell gene expression analysis of organoids developed from CD44+ CSCs, we identified TWIST1 as a key molecule for maintaining the undifferentiated state of cancer cells. Consistent with the finding, we found that TGF-beta signaling pathway, a regulator of TWIST1, was specifically activated in the undifferentiated CD44+ CSCs in human colorectal cancer using microarray-based gene expression analysis and quantitative pathology imaging system. Furthermore, we showed that external stimulation with TGF-beta and the induction of TWIST1 converted CD44- non-CSCs into the undifferentiated CD44+ CSCs, leading to the significant increment of CSCs in xenograft models. This study strongly suggests dedifferentiation driven by TGF-beta signaling enhances stem cell properties in human colorectal cancer.	
32775326        	Fibroblast-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Induce Colorectal Cancer Progression by Transmitting Amphiregulin.            	Extracellular vesicles (EV), structures surrounded by a biological membrane, transport biologically active molecules, and represent a recently identified way of intercellular communication. Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most common cancer types in the Western countries, is composed of both tumor and stromal cells and the amount of stromal fibroblasts negatively correlates with patient survival. Here we show that normal colon fibroblasts (NCF) release EVs with a characteristic miRNA cargo profile when stimulated with TGFβ, one of the most important activating factors of fibroblasts, without a significant increase in the amount of secreted EVs. Importantly, fibroblast-derived EVs induce cell proliferation in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent patient-derived organoids, one of the best current systems to model the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of human cancers. In contrast, fibroblast-derived EVs have no effect in 3D models where EGF is dispensible. This EV-induced cell proliferation did not depend on whether NCFs or cancer-associated fibroblasts were studied or on the pre-activation by TGFβ, suggesting that TGFβ-induced sorting of specific miRNAs into EVs does not play a major role in enhancing CRC proliferation. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that amphiregulin, transported by EVs, is a major factor in inducing CRC cell proliferation. We found that neutralization of EV-bound amphiregulin blocked the effects of the fibroblast-derived EVs. Collectively, our data suggest a novel mechanism for fibroblast-induced CRC cell proliferation, coupled to EV-associated amphiregulin.

32051246        	Statin-induced GGPP depletion blocks macropinocytosis and starves cells with oncogenic defects.            	Cancer cells display novel characteristics which can be exploited for therapeutic advantage. Isolated studies have shown that 1) the mevalonate pathway and 2) increased macropinocytosis are important in tumorigenesis, but a connection between these two observations has not been envisioned. A library screen for compounds that selectively killed Dictyostelium pten                        -                     cells identified pitavastatin. Pitavastatin also killed human breast epithelial MCF10A cells lacking PTEN or expressing K-RasG12V, as well as mouse tumor organoids. The selective killing of cells with oncogenic defects was traced to GGPP (geranylgeranyl diphosphate) depletion. Disruption of GGPP synthase in Dictyostelium revealed that GGPP is needed for pseudopod extension and macropinocytosis. Fluid-phase uptake through macropinocytosis is lower in PTEN-deleted cells and, as reported previously, higher in cells expressing activated Ras. Nevertheless, uptake was more sensitive to pitavastatin in cells with either of these oncogenic mutations than in wild-type cells. Loading the residual macropinosomes after pitavastatin with high concentrations of protein mitigated the cell death, indicating that defective macropinocytosis leads to amino acid starvation. Our studies suggest that the dependence of cancer cells on the mevalonate pathway is due to the role of GGPP in macropinocytosis and the reliance of these cells on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. Thus, inhibition of the networks mediating these processes is likely to be effective in cancer intervention.	
29728272        	Inflammation-on-a-Chip: Probing the Immune System Ex Vivo.            	Inflammation is the typical result of activating the host immune system against pathogens, and it helps to clear microbes from tissues. However, inflammation can occur in the absence of pathogens, contributing to tissue damage and leading to disease. Understanding how immune cells coordinate their activities to initiate, modulate, and terminate inflammation is key to developing effective interventions to preserve health and combat diseases. Towards this goal, inflammation-on-a-chip tools provide unique features that greatly benefit the study of inflammation. They reconstitute tissue environments in microfabricated devices and enable real-time, high-resolution observations and quantification of cellular activities relevant to inflammation. We review here recent advances in inflammation-on-a-chip technologies and highlight the biological insights and clinical applications enabled by these emerging tools.

33091622        	The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Regulates RIPK1 and Colorectal Cancer Resistance to Necroptosis.            	The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) affects multiple steps of the mRNA metabolism during brain development and in different neoplastic processes. However, the contribution of FMRP in colon carcinogenesis has not been investigated.                FMR1 mRNA transcript and FMRP protein expression were analyzed in human colon samples derived from patients with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) and healthy subjects. We used a well-established mouse model of sporadic CRC induced by azoxymethane to determine the possible role of FMRP in CRC. To address whether FMRP controls cancer cell survival, we analyzed cell death pathway in CRC human epithelial cell lines and in patient-derived colon cancer organoids in presence or absence of a specific FMR1 antisense oligonucleotide or siRNA.                We document a significant increase of FMRP in human CRC relative to non-tumor tissues. Next, using an inducible mouse model of CRC, we observed a reduction of colonic tumor incidence and size in the Fmr1 knockout mice. The abrogation of FMRP induced spontaneous cell death in human CRC cell lines activating the necroptotic pathway. Indeed, specific immunoprecipitation experiments on human cell lines and CRC samples indicated that FMRP binds receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) mRNA, suggesting that FMRP acts as a regulator of necroptosis pathway through the surveillance of RIPK1 mRNA metabolism. Treatment of human CRC cell lines and patient-derived colon cancer organoids with the FMR1 antisense resulted in up-regulation of RIPK1.                Altogether, these data support a role for FMRP  in controlling RIPK1 expression and necroptotic activation in CRC.                Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

33084231        	The biological process of lysine-tRNA charging is therapeutically targetable in liver cancer.            	Mature transfer RNAs (tRNA) charged with amino acids decode mRNA to synthesize proteins. Dysregulation of translational machineries has a fundamental impact on cancer biology. This study aims to map the tRNAome landscape in liver cancer patients and to explore potential therapeutic targets at the interface of charging amino acid with tRNA.                Resected tumour and paired tumour-free (TFL) tissues from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients (n = 69), and healthy liver tissues from organ transplant donors (n = 21), HCC cell lines, and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) patient-derived tumour organoids were used.                The expression levels of different mature tRNAs were highly correlated and closely clustered within individual tissues, suggesting that different members of the tRNAome function cooperatively in protein translation. Interestingly, high expression of tRNA-Lys-CUU in HCC tumours was associated with more tumour recurrence (HR 1.1; P = .022) and worse patient survival (HR 1.1; P = .0037). The expression of Lysyl-tRNA Synthetase (KARS), the enzyme catalysing the charge of lysine to tRNA-Lys-CUU, was significantly upregulated in HCC tumour tissues compared to tumour-free liver tissues. In HCC cell lines, lysine deprivation, KARS knockdown or treatment with the KARS inhibitor cladosporin effectively inhibited overall cell growth, single cell-based colony formation and cell migration. This was mechanistically mediated by cell cycling arrest and induction of apoptosis. Finally, these inhibitory effects were confirmed in 3D cultured patient-derived CC organoids.                The biological process of charging tRNA-Lys-CUU with lysine sustains liver cancer cell growth and migration, and is clinically relevant in HCC patients. This process can be therapeutically targeted and represents an unexplored territory for developing novel treatment strategies against liver cancer.                © 2020 The Authors.

32814111        	In Colorectal Cancer Cells With Mutant KRAS, SLC25A22-Mediated Glutaminolysis Reduces DNA Demethylation to Increase WNT Signaling, Stemness, and Drug Resistance.            	Mutant KRAS promotes glutaminolysis, a process that uses steps from the tricarboxylic cycle to convert glutamine to α-ketoglutarate and other molecules via glutaminase and SLC25A22. This results in inhibition of demethylases and epigenetic alterations in cells that increase proliferation and stem cell features. We investigated whether mutant KRAS-mediated glutaminolysis affects the epigenomes and activities of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.                We created ApcminKrasG12D mice with intestine-specific knockout of SLC25A22 (ApcminKrasG12DSLC25A22fl/fl mice). Intestine tissues were collected and analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and DNA methylation assays; organoids were derived and studied for stem cell features, along with organoids derived from 2 human colorectal tumor specimens. Colon epithelial cells (1CT) and CRC cells (DLD1, DKS8, HKE3, and HCT116) that expressed mutant KRAS, with or without knockdown of SLC25A22 or other proteins, were deprived of glutamine or glucose and assayed for proliferation, colony formation, glucose or glutamine consumption, and apoptosis; gene expression patterns were analyzed by RNA sequencing, proteins by immunoblots, and metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, with [U-13C5]-glutamine as a tracer. Cells and organoids with knocked down, knocked out, or overexpressed proteins were analyzed for DNA methylation at CpG sites using arrays. We performed immunohistochemical analyses of colorectal tumor samples from 130 patients in Hong Kong (57 with KRAS mutations) and Kaplan-Meier analyses of survival. We analyzed gene expression levels of colorectal tumor samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas.                CRC cells that express activated KRAS required glutamine for survival, and rapidly incorporated it into the tricarboxylic cycle (glutaminolysis); this process required SLC25A22. Cells incubated with succinate and non-essential amino acids could proliferate under glutamine-free conditions. Mutant KRAS cells maintained a low ratio of α-ketoglutarate to succinate, resulting in reduced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-a marker of DNA demethylation, and hypermethylation at CpG sites. Many of the hypermethylated genes were in the WNT signaling pathway and at the protocadherin gene cluster on chromosome 5q31. CRC cells without mutant KRAS, or with mutant KRAS and knockout of SLC25A22, expressed protocadherin genes (PCDHAC2, PCDHB7, PCDHB15, PCDHGA1, and PCDHGA6)-DNA was not methylated at these loci. Expression of the protocadherin genes reduced WNT signaling to β-catenin and expression of the stem cell marker LGR5. ApcminKrasG12DSLC25A22fl/fl mice developed fewer colon tumors than ApcminKrasG12D mice (P < .01). Organoids from ApcminKrasG12DSLC25A22fl/fl mice had reduced expression of LGR5 and other markers of stemness compared with organoids derived from ApcminKrasG12D mice. Knockdown of SLC25A22 in human colorectal tumor organoids reduced clonogenicity. Knockdown of lysine demethylases, or succinate supplementation, restored expression of LGR5 to SLC25A22-knockout CRC cells. Knockout of SLC25A22 in CRC cells that express mutant KRAS increased their sensitivity to 5-fluorouacil. Level of SLC25A22 correlated with levels of LGR5, nuclear β-catenin, and a stem cell-associated gene expression pattern in human colorectal tumors with mutations in KRAS and reduced survival times of patients.                In CRC cells that express activated KRAS, SLC25A22 promotes accumulation of succinate, resulting in increased DNA methylation, activation of WNT signaling to β-catenin, increased expression of LGR5, proliferation, stem cell features, and resistance to 5-fluorouacil. Strategies to disrupt this pathway might be developed for treatment of CRC.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
31867777        	NEDD4 and NEDD4L regulate Wnt signalling and intestinal stem cell priming by degrading LGR5 receptor.            	The intestinal stem cell (ISC) marker LGR5 is a receptor for R-spondin (RSPO) that functions to potentiate Wnt signalling in the proliferating crypt. It has been recently shown that Wnt plays a priming role for ISC self-renewal by inducing RSPO receptor LGR5 expression. Despite its pivotal role in homeostasis, regeneration and cancer, little is known about the post-translational regulation of LGR5. Here, we show that the HECT-domain E3 ligases NEDD4 and NEDD4L are expressed in the crypt stem cell regions and regulate ISC priming by degrading LGR receptors. Loss of Nedd4 and Nedd4l enhances ISC proliferation, increases sensitivity to RSPO stimulation and accelerates tumour development in Apcmin mice with increased numbers of high-grade adenomas. Mechanistically, we find that both NEDD4 and NEDD4L negatively regulate Wnt/β-catenin signalling by targeting LGR5 receptor and DVL2 for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. Our findings unveil the previously unreported post-translational control of LGR receptors via NEDD4/NEDD4L to regulate ISC priming. Inactivation of NEDD4 and NEDD4L increases Wnt activation and ISC numbers, which subsequently enhances tumour predisposition and progression.                © 2019 The Authors.

31998733        	Radial Profile Analysis of Epithelial Polarity in Breast Acini: A Tool for Primary (Breast) Cancer Prevention.            	Preventing cancer is vastly better than treating the disease in terms of a patient's quality of life and healthcare costs. Yet, to screen for chemopreventative drugs or evaluate interventions aimed at lowering cancer risk, quantitative readouts of risk are needed. In the breast and in other organs of epithelial origin, apical-basal polarity is key to homeostasis and is one of the first tissue characteristics lost during cancer initiation. Therefore, apical-basal polarity may be leveraged as an "architectural" determinant of cancer risk. A classic approach to quantify the localization of epithelial polarity markers is visual scoring at the microscope by trained investigators. This approach is time-intensive and limited to low throughput. To increase the speed, accuracy, and scoring volume, we developed an algorithm that essentially replaces the human eye to objectively quantify epithelial polarity in microscopy images of breast glandular units (acini). Acini in culture are identified based on a nuclear stain and the corresponding masks are divided into concentric terraces of equal width. This positional information is used to calculate radial intensity profiles (RP) of polarity markers. Profiles with a steep slope represent polarized structures, whereas more horizontal curves are indicative of non-polarized acini. To compare treatment effects, RP curves are integrated into summary values of polarity. We envision applications of this method for primary cancer prevention research with acini organoids, specifically (1) to screen for chemoprevention drugs, (2) for toxicological assessment of suspected carcinogens and pharmacological hit compounds, and (3) for personalized evaluation of cancer risk and risk-reducing interventions. The RadialProfiler algorithm developed for the MATLAB computing environment and for users without prior informatics knowledge is publicly available on the Open Science Framework (OSF).

30257718        	Characterization of drug responses of mini patient-derived xenografts in mice for predicting cancer patient clinical therapeutic response.            	Patient-derived organoids and xenografts (PDXs) have emerged as powerful models in functional diagnostics with high predictive power for anticancer drug response. However, limitations such as engraftment failure and time-consuming for establishing and expanding PDX models followed by testing drug efficacy, and inability to subject to systemic drug administration for ex vivo organoid culture hinder realistic and fast decision-making in selecting the right therapeutics in the clinic. The present study aimed to develop an advanced PDX model, namely MiniPDX, for rapidly testing drug efficacy to strengthen its value in personalized cancer treatment.                We developed a rapid in vivo drug sensitivity assay, OncoVee® MiniPDX, for screening clinically relevant regimens for cancer. In this model, patient-derived tumor cells were arrayed within hollow fiber capsules, implanted subcutaneously into mice and cultured for 7 days. The cellular activity morphology and pharmacokinetics were systematically evaluated. MiniPDX performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) was examined using PDX as the reference. Drug responses were examined by tumor cell growth inhibition rate and tumor growth inhibition rate in PDX models and MiniPDX assays respectively. The results from MiniPDX were also used to evaluate its predictive power for clinical outcomes.                Morphological and histopathological features of tumor cells within the MiniPDX capsules matched those both in PDX models and in original tumors. Drug responses in the PDX tumor graft assays correlated well with those in the corresponding MiniPDX assays using 26 PDX models generated from patients, including 14 gastric cancer, 10 lung cancer and 2 pancreatic cancer. The positive predictive value of MiniPDX was 92%, and the negative predictive value was 81% with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 93%. Through expanding to clinical tumor samples, MiniPDX assay showed potential of wide clinical application.                Fast in vivo MiniPDX assay based on capsule implantation was developed-to assess drug responses of both PDX tumor grafts and clinical cancer specimens. The high correlation between drug responses of paired MiniPDX and PDX tumor graft assay, as well as translational data suggest that MiniPDX assay is an advanced tool for personalized cancer treatment.	
30348189        	Integrin-Rac signalling for mammary epithelial stem cell self-renewal.            	Stem cells are precursors for all mammary epithelia, including ductal and alveolar epithelia, and myoepithelial cells. In vivo mammary epithelia reside in a tissue context and interact with their milieu via receptors such as integrins. Extracellular matrix receptors coordinate important cellular signalling platforms, of which integrins are the central architects. We have previously shown that integrins are required for mammary epithelial development and function, including survival, cell cycle, and polarity, as well as for the expression of mammary-specific genes. In the present study we looked at the role of integrins in mammary epithelial stem cell self-renewal.                We used an in vitro stem cell assay with primary mouse mammary epithelial cells isolated from genetically altered mice. This involved a 3D organoid assay, providing an opportunity to distinguish the stem cell- or luminal progenitor-driven organoids as structures with solid or hollow appearances, respectively.                We demonstrate that integrins are essential for the maintenance and self-renewal of mammary epithelial stem cells. Moreover integrins activate the Rac1 signalling pathway in stem cells, which leads to the stimulation of a Wnt pathway, resulting in expression of β-catenin target genes such as Axin2 and Lef1.                Integrin/Rac signalling has a role in specifying the activation of a canonical Wnt pathway that is required for mammary epithelial stem cell self-renewal.	
32081850        	Klf5 acetylation regulates luminal differentiation of basal progenitors in prostate development and regeneration.            	Prostate development depends on balanced cell proliferation and differentiation, and acetylated KLF5 is known to alter epithelial proliferation. It remains elusive whether post-translational modifications of transcription factors can differentially determine adult stem/progenitor cell fate. Here we report that, in human and mouse prostates, Klf5 is expressed in both basal and luminal cells, with basal cells preferentially expressing acetylated Klf5. Functionally, Klf5 is indispensable for maintaining basal progenitors, their luminal differentiation, and the proliferation of their basal and luminal progenies. Acetylated Klf5 is also essential for basal progenitors' maintenance and proper luminal differentiation, as deacetylation of Klf5 causes excess basal-to-luminal differentiation; attenuates androgen-mediated organoid organization; and retards postnatal prostate development. In basal progenitor-derived luminal cells, Klf5 deacetylation increases their proliferation and attenuates their survival and regeneration following castration and subsequent androgen restoration. Mechanistically, Klf5 deacetylation activates Notch signaling. Klf5 and its acetylation thus contribute to postnatal prostate development and regeneration by controlling basal progenitor cell fate.	
32024754        	TIP5 primes prostate luminal cells for the oncogenic transformation mediated by PTEN-loss.            	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Its clinical and molecular heterogeneities and the lack of in vitro models outline the complexity of PCa in the clinical and research settings. We established an in vitro mouse PCa model based on organoid technology that takes into account the cell of origin and the order of events. Primary PCa with deletion of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (PTEN-del) can be modeled through Pten-down-regulation in mouse organoids. We used this system to elucidate the contribution of TIP5 in PCa initiation, a chromatin regulator that is implicated in aggressive PCa. High TIP5 expression correlates with primary PTEN-del PCa and this combination strongly associates with reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival. TIP5 is critical for the initiation of PCa of luminal origin mediated by Pten-loss whereas it is dispensable once Pten-loss mediated transformation is established. Cross-species analyses revealed a PTEN gene signature that identified a group of aggressive primary PCas characterized by PTEN-del, high-TIP5 expression, and a TIP5-regulated gene expression profile. The results highlight the modeling of PCa with organoids as a powerful tool to elucidate the role of genetic alterations found in recent studies in their time orders and cells of origin, thereby providing further optimization for tumor stratification to improve the clinical management of PCa.

31133044        	Inhibition of ERK1/2 in cancer-associated pancreatic stellate cells suppresses cancer-stromal interaction and metastasis.            	Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) have been related to multiple cancers, including breast cancer, hepatocellular cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer. ERK1/2 inhibitor can suppress growth of KRAS-mutant pancreatic tumors by targeting cancer cell. However, no studies have shown the expression of ERK1/2 on pancreatic stromal and its effect on pancreatic cancer-stromal interaction.                Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were performed to detect the expression of p-ERK1/2 in pancreatic tissues and cells. Cell viability assay was used to study IC50 of ERK inhibitor on pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) and primary cancer-associated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Transwell migration, invasion, cell viability assay, senescence β-galactosidase staining were performed to determine the effect of ERK inhibitor on PCCs and PSCs in vitro and in vivo. The expression of key factors involved in autophagy and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process were evaluated by western blotting. The expression of key factors related to cell invasiveness and malignancy were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Co-transplantation of PCC Organoid and PSC using a splenic xenograft mouse model was used to evaluated combined treatment of ERK inhibitor and autophagy inhibitor.                Immunohistochemical staining in pancreatic tumor samples and transgenetic mice detected p-ERK1/2 expression in both cancer cells and stromal cells. In pancreatic tissues, p-ERK1/2 was strongly expressed in cancer-associated PSCs compared with cancer cells and normal PSCs. PSCs were also significantly more sensitive to ERK1/2 inhibitor treatment. Inhibition of ERK1/2 suppressed EMT transition in HMPCCs, upregulated cellular senescence markers, activated autophagy in cancer-associated PSCs; and suppressed cancer-stromal interaction, which enhanced invasiveness and viability of cancer cells. We also found that chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, suppressed ERK inhibition-induced autophagy and promoted PSC cellular senescence, leading to significantly decreased cell proliferation. The combination of an ERK inhibitor and autophagy inhibitor suppressed liver metastasis in a splenic pancreatic cancer organoid xenograft mouse model.                These data indicate that inhibition of ERK1/2 in cancer-associated pancreatic stellate cells suppresses cancer-stromal interaction and metastasis.	
29097309        	Emerging tumor spheroids technologies for 3D in vitro cancer modeling.            	Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Around 90% of deaths are caused by metastasis and just 10% by primary tumor. The advancement of treatment approaches is not at the same rhythm of the disease; making cancer a focal target of biomedical research. To enhance the understanding and prompts the therapeutic delivery; concepts of tissue engineering are applied in the development of in vitro models that can bridge between 2D cell culture and animal models, mimicking tissue microenvironment. Tumor spheroid represents highly suitable 3D organoid-like framework elucidating the intra and inter cellular signaling of cancer, like that formed in physiological niche. However, spheroids are of limited value in studying critical biological phenomenon such as tumor-stroma interactions involving extra cellular matrix or immune system. Therefore, a compelling need of tailoring spheroid technologies with physiologically relevant biomaterials or in silico models, is ever emerging. The diagnostic and prognostic role of spheroids rearrangements within biomaterials or microfluidic channel is indicative of patient management; particularly for the decision of targeted therapy. Fragmented information on available in vitro spheroid models and lack of critical analysis on transformation aspects of these strategies; pushes the urge to comprehensively overview the recent technological advancements (e.g. bioprinting, micro-fluidic technologies or use of biomaterials to attain the third dimension) in the shed of translationable cancer research. In present article, relationships between current models and their possible exploitation in clinical success is explored with the highlight of existing challenges in defining therapeutic targets and screening of drug efficacy.

28751424        	A simple, cost-effective method for generating murine colonic 3D enteroids and 2D monolayers for studies of primary epithelial cell function.            	Cancer cell lines have been the mainstay of intestinal epithelial experimentation for decades, due primarily to their immortality and ease of culture. However, because of the inherent biological abnormalities of cancer cell lines, many cellular biologists are currently transitioning away from these models and toward more representative primary cells. This has been particularly challenging, but recent advances in the generation of intestinal organoids have brought the routine use of primary cells within reach of most epithelial biologists. Nevertheless, even with the proliferation of publications that use primary intestinal epithelial cells, there is still a considerable amount of trial and error required for laboratories to establish a consistent and reliable method to culture three-dimensional (3D) intestinal organoids and primary epithelial monolayers. We aim to minimize the time other laboratories spend troubleshooting the technique and present a standard method for culturing primary epithelial cells. Therefore, we have described our optimized, high-yield, cost-effective protocol to grow 3D murine colonoids for more than 20 passages and our detailed methods to culture these cells as confluent monolayers for at least 14 days, enabling a wide variety of potential future experiments. By supporting and expanding on the current literature of primary epithelial culture optimization and detailed use in experiments, we hope to help enable the widespread adoption of these innovative methods and allow consistency of results obtained across laboratories and institutions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Primary intestinal epithelial monolayers are notoriously difficult to maintain culture, even with the recent advances in the field. We describe, in detail, the protocols required to maintain three-dimensional cultures of murine colonoids and passage these primary epithelial cells to confluent monolayers in a standardized, high-yield and cost-effective manner.

30578319        	Inhibition of de novo lipogenesis targets androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.            	A hallmark of prostate cancer progression is dysregulation of lipid metabolism via overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme in de novo fatty acid synthesis. Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) develops resistance to inhibitors of androgen receptor (AR) signaling through a variety of mechanisms, including the emergence of the constitutively active AR variant V7 (AR-V7). Here, we developed an FASN inhibitor (IPI-9119) and demonstrated that selective FASN inhibition antagonizes CRPC growth through metabolic reprogramming and results in reduced protein expression and transcriptional activity of both full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR-V7. Activation of the reticulum endoplasmic stress response resulting in reduced protein synthesis was involved in IPI-9119-mediated inhibition of the AR pathway. In vivo, IPI-9119 reduced growth of AR-V7-driven CRPC xenografts and human mCRPC-derived organoids and enhanced the efficacy of enzalutamide in CRPC cells. In human mCRPC, both FASN and AR-FL were detected in 87% of metastases. AR-V7 was found in 39% of bone metastases and consistently coexpressed with FASN. In patients treated with enzalutamide and/or abiraterone FASN/AR-V7 double-positive metastases were found in 77% of cases. These findings provide a compelling rationale for the use of FASN inhibitors in mCRPCs, including those overexpressing AR-V7.                Copyright © 2019 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.	
33558489        	Malignant subclone drives metastasis of genetically and phenotypically heterogenous cell clusters through fibrotic niche generation.            	A concept of polyclonal metastasis has recently been proposed, wherein tumor cell clusters break off from the primary site and are disseminated. However, the involvement of driver mutations in such polyclonal mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we show that non-metastatic AP cells metastasize to the liver with metastatic AKTP cells after co-transplantation to the spleen. Furthermore, AKTP cell depletion after the development of metastases results in the continuous proliferation of the remaining AP cells, indicating a role of AKTP cells in the early step of polyclonal metastasis. Importantly, AKTP cells, but not AP cells, induce fibrotic niche generation when arrested in the sinusoid, and such fibrotic microenvironment promotes the colonization of AP cells. These results indicate that non-metastatic cells can metastasize via the polyclonal metastasis mechanism using the fibrotic niche induced by malignant cells. Thus, targeting the fibrotic niche is an effective strategy for halting polyclonal metastasis.	
33257837        	RON signalling promotes therapeutic resistance in ESR1 mutant breast cancer.            	Oestrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations are frequently acquired in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients who were treated with aromatase inhibitors (AI) in the metastatic setting. Acquired ESR1 mutations are associated with poor prognosis and there is a lack of effective therapies that selectively target these cancers.                We performed a proteomic kinome analysis in ESR1 Y537S mutant cells to identify hyperactivated kinases in ESR1 mutant cells. We validated Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON) and PI3K hyperactivity through phospho-immunoblot analysis, organoid growth assays, and in an in vivo patient-derived xenograft (PDX) metastatic model.                We demonstrated that RON was hyperactivated in ESR1 mutant models, and in acquired palbociclib-resistant (PalbR) models. RON and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) interacted as shown through pharmacological and genetic inhibition and were regulated by the mutant ER as demonstrated by reduced phospho-protein expression with endocrine therapies (ET). We show that ET in combination with a RON inhibitor (RONi) decreased ex vivo organoid growth of ESR1 mutant models, and as a monotherapy in PalbR models, demonstrating its therapeutic efficacy. Significantly, ET in combination with the RONi reduced metastasis of an ESR1 Y537S mutant PDX model.                Our results demonstrate that RON/PI3K pathway inhibition may be an effective treatment strategy in ESR1 mutant and PalbR MBC patients. Clinically our data predict that ET resistance mechanisms can also contribute to CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance.	
26419819        	Preclinical models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most difficult human malignancies to treat. The 5-year survival rate of PDA patients is 7% and PDA is predicted to become the second leading cancer-related cause of death in the USA. Despite intensive efforts, the translation of findings in preclinical studies has been ineffective, due partially to the lack of preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate features of human PDA. Here, we review current preclinical models for human PDA (eg human PDA cell lines, cell line-based xenografts and patient-derived tumour xenografts). In addition, we discuss potential applications of the recently developed pancreatic ductal organoids, three-dimensional culture systems and organoid-based xenografts as new preclinical models for PDA.

29978469        	Activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling results in resistance to a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in colorectal cancer cells harboring PIK3CA mutations.            	PIK3CA is a frequently mutated gene in cancer, including about ~15 to 20% of colorectal cancers (CRC). PIK3CA mutations lead to activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which plays pivotal roles in tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated the mechanism of resistance of PIK3CA-mutant CRC cell lines to gedatolisib, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Out of a panel of 29 CRC cell lines, we identified 7 harboring one or more PIK3CA mutations; of these, 5 and 2 were found to be sensitive and resistant to gedatolisib, respectively. Both of the gedatolisib-resistant cell lines expressed high levels of active glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3β) and harbored the same frameshift mutation (c.465_466insC; H155fs*) in TCF7, which encodes a positive transcriptional regulator of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. Inhibition of GSK3β activity in gedatolisib-resistant cells by siRNA-mediated knockdown or treatment with a GSK3β-specific inhibitor effectively reduced the activity of molecules downstream of mTOR and also decreased signaling through the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Notably, GSK3β inhibition rendered the resistant cell lines sensitive to gedatolisib cytotoxicity, both in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Taken together, these data demonstrate that aberrant regulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling and active GSK3β induced by the TCF7 frameshift mutation cause resistance to the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor gedatolisib. Cotreatment with GSK3β inhibitors may be a strategy to overcome the resistance of PIK3CA- and TCF7-mutant CRC to PI3K/mTOR-targeted therapies.                © 2018 The Authors.

30904501        	Ultrasound-activated microbubbles as a novel intracellular drug delivery system for urinary tract infection.            	The development of new modalities for high-efficiency intracellular drug delivery is a priority for a number of disease areas. One such area is urinary tract infection (UTI), which is one of the most common infectious diseases globally and which imposes an immense economic and healthcare burden. Common uropathogenic bacteria have been shown to invade the urothelial wall during acute UTI, forming latent intracellular reservoirs that can evade antimicrobials and the immune response. This behaviour likely facilitates the high recurrence rates after oral antibiotic treatments, which are not able to penetrate the bladder wall and accumulate to an effective concentration. Meanwhile, oral antibiotics may also exacerbate antimicrobial resistance and cause systemic side effects. Using a human urothelial organoid model, we tested the ability of novel ultrasound-activated lipid microbubbles to deliver drugs into the cytoplasm of apical cells. The gas-filled lipid microbubbles were decorated with liposomes containing the non-cell-permeant antibiotic gentamicin and a fluorescent marker. The microbubble suspension was added to buffer at the apical surface of the bladder model before being exposed to ultrasound (1.1 MHz, 2.5 Mpa, 5500 cycles at 20 ms pulse duration) for 20 s. Our results show that ultrasound-activated intracellular delivery using microbubbles was over 16 times greater than the control group and twice that achieved by liposomes that were not associated with microbubbles. Moreover, no cell damage was detected. Together, our data show that ultrasound-activated microbubbles can safely deliver high concentrations of drugs into urothelial cells, and have the potential to be a more efficacious alternative to traditional oral antibiotic regimes for UTI. This modality of intracellular drug delivery may prove useful in other clinical indications, such as cancer and gene therapy, where such penetration would aid in treatment.

31546785        	Regulation of Ketogenic Enzyme HMGCS2 by Wnt/β-catenin/PPARγ Pathway in Intestinal Cells.            	The Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a crucial role in development and renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), a rate-limiting ketogenic enzyme in the synthesis of ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), contributes to the regulation of intestinal cell differentiation. Here, we have shown that HMGCS2 is a novel target of Wnt/β-catenin/PPARγ signaling in intestinal epithelial cancer cell lines and normal intestinal organoids. Inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway resulted in increased protein and mRNA expression of HMGCS2 and βHB production in human colon cancer cell lines LS174T and Caco2. In addition, Wnt inhibition increased expression of PPARγ and its target genes, FABP2 and PLIN2, in these cells. Conversely, activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling decreased protein and mRNA levels of HMGCS2, βHB production, and expression of PPARγ and its target genes in LS174T and Caco2 cells and mouse intestinal organoids. Moreover, inhibition of PPARγ reduced HMGCS2 expression and βHB production, while activation of PPARγ increased HMGCS2 expression and βHB synthesis. Furthermore, PPARγ bound the promoter of HMGCS2 and this binding was enhanced by β-catenin knockdown. Finally, we showed that HMGCS2 inhibited, while Wnt/β-catenin stimulated, glycolysis, which contributed to regulation of intestinal cell differentiation. Our results identified HMGCS2 as a downstream target of Wnt/β-catenin/PPARγ signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, our findings suggest that Wnt/β-catenin/PPARγ signaling regulates intestinal cell differentiation, at least in part, through regulation of ketogenesis.	
28678785        	Dependency of a therapy-resistant state of cancer cells on a lipid peroxidase pathway.            	Plasticity of the cell state has been proposed to drive resistance to multiple classes of cancer therapies, thereby limiting their effectiveness. A high-mesenchymal cell state observed in human tumours and cancer cell lines has been associated with resistance to multiple treatment modalities across diverse cancer lineages, but the mechanistic underpinning for this state has remained incompletely understood. Here we molecularly characterize this therapy-resistant high-mesenchymal cell state in human cancer cell lines and organoids and show that it depends on a druggable lipid-peroxidase pathway that protects against ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death induced by the build-up of toxic lipid peroxides. We show that this cell state is characterized by activity of enzymes that promote the synthesis of polyunsaturated lipids. These lipids are the substrates for lipid peroxidation by lipoxygenase enzymes. This lipid metabolism creates a dependency on pathways converging on the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), a selenocysteine-containing enzyme that dissipates lipid peroxides and thereby prevents the iron-mediated reactions of peroxides that induce ferroptotic cell death. Dependency on GPX4 was found to exist across diverse therapy-resistant states characterized by high expression of ZEB1, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition in epithelial-derived carcinomas, TGFβ-mediated therapy-resistance in melanoma, treatment-induced neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer, and sarcomas, which are fixed in a mesenchymal state owing to their cells of origin. We identify vulnerability to ferroptic cell death induced by inhibition of a lipid peroxidase pathway as a feature of therapy-resistant cancer cells across diverse mesenchymal cell-state contexts.	
30558346        	Biobanking Organoids or Ground-State Stem Cells?            	Autologous transplantation of human epidermal stem cells cultured in Green's method is one of the first examples of utilizing adult stem cells in regenerative medicine. Using the same method, we cloned p63-expressing distal airway stem cells and showed their essential role in lung regeneration in a mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, adult stem cells of columnar epithelial tissues had until recently evaded all attempts at cloning. To address this issue, we developed a novel technology that enabled cloning ground-state stem cells of the columnar epithelium. The adaption of this technology to clone stem cells of cancer precursors furthered our understanding of the dynamics of processes such as clonal evolution and dominance in Barrett's esophagus, as well as for testing platforms for chemical screening. Taken together, the properties of these ground-state stem cells, including unlimited propagation, genomic stability, and regio-specificity, make them ideal for regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug discovery.	
32816914        	STAT3 and GR Cooperate to Drive Gene Expression and Growth of Basal-Like Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.            	Breast cancers are divided into subtypes with different prognoses and treatment responses based on global differences in gene expression. Luminal breast cancer gene expression and proliferation are driven by estrogen receptor alpha, and targeting this transcription factor is the most effective therapy for this subtype. By contrast, it remains unclear which transcription factors drive the gene expression signature that defines basal-like triple-negative breast cancer, and there are no targeted therapies approved to treat this aggressive subtype. In this study, we utilized integrated genomic analysis of DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and gene expression in large collections of breast cancer cell lines and patient tumors to identify transcription factors responsible for the basal-like gene expression program. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and STAT3 bind to the same genomic regulatory regions, which were specifically open and unmethylated in basal-like breast cancer. These transcription factors cooperated to regulate expression of hundreds of genes in the basal-like gene expression signature, which were associated with poor prognosis. Combination treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of both transcription factors resulted in synergistic decreases in cell growth in cell lines and patient-derived organoid models. This study demonstrates that GR and STAT3 cooperate to regulate the basal-like breast cancer gene expression program and provides the basis for improved therapy for basal-like triple-negative breast cancer through rational combination of STAT3 and GR inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that GR and STAT3 cooperate to activate the canonical gene expression signature of basal-like triple-negative breast cancer and that combination treatment with STAT3 and GR inhibitors could provide synergistic therapeutic efficacy.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30474758        	Patient-derived, three-dimensional spheroid cultures provide a versatile translational model for the study of organ-confined prostate cancer.            	To generate and characterize 3D spheroid suspension cultures from radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens as a versatile model system for organ-confined prostate cancer (PCa).                Cancerous tissue samples from RP specimens were excised by a uropathologist. Preparation of 3D spheroids was done by mechanical disintegration and limited enzymatic digestion followed by serial filtration through 100 μm- and 40 μm-cell strainers. Thereafter, spheroids were cultured in a modified stem cell medium and characterized by a live/dead assay, whole-spheroid immunohistochemistry (IHC; CK5, CK8, AMACR, PSA, Ki67, AR, αSMA, Vimentin, E-Cadherin) and PSA-measurements in culture medium. Furthermore, their response to pharmaceutical treatment with docetaxel, bicalutamide, enzalutamide and abiraterone was tested.                173 RP cases were included. The median preoperative PSA-level was 16.12 ng/ml [range 0.99;345], the median Gleason score was 7b [6;10]. 64 cases were excluded due to low tumor content in frozen sections (43) or to insufficient spheroid formation (21). In the remaining 109 cases, spheroids formed successfully and stayed viable for up to several months. IHC analysis revealed AR-, CK8-, and AMACR-positivity in nearly all cases, while CK5-positive cells were detectable only occasionally as were α-SMA and Vimentin. E-Cadherin was positive in most cases. Furthermore, spheroids proved to be amenable to cryopreservation. While abiraterone had no effect and docetaxel only a moderate effect, spheroid viability was markedly reduced upon bicalutamide and enzalutamide treatment.                Multicellular 3D spheroids can be generated from patient-derived RP tissue samples and serve as an innovative in vitro model of organ-confined PCa.	
27859262        	Functional and prognostic significance of the genomic amplification of frizzled 6 (FZD6) in breast cancer.            	Frizzled receptors mediate Wnt ligand signalling, which is crucially involved in regulating tissue development and differentiation, and is often deregulated in cancer. In this study, we found that the gene encoding the Wnt receptor frizzled 6 (FZD6) is frequently amplified in breast cancer, with an increased incidence in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. Ablation of FZD6 expression in mammary cancer cell lines: (1) inhibited motility and invasion; (2) induced a more symmetrical shape of organoid three-dimensional cultures; and (3) inhibited bone and liver metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, FZD6 signalling is required for the assembly of the fibronectin matrix, interfering with the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Ectopic delivery of fibronectin in FZD6-depleted, triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells rearranged the actin cytoskeleton and restored epidermal growth factor-mediated invasion. In patients with localized, lymph node-negative (early) breast cancer, positivity of tumour cells for FZD6 protein identified patients with reduced distant relapse-free survival. Multivariate analysis indicated an independent prognostic significance of FZD6 expression in TNBC tumours, predicting distant, but not local, relapse. We conclude that the FZD6-fibronectin actin axis identified in our study could be exploited for drug development in highly metastatic forms of breast cancer, such as TNBC. © 2016 The Authors.

28544217        	Toward a CRISPR Picture: Use of CRISPR/Cas9 to Model Diseases in Human Stem Cells In Vitro.            	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be differentiated into any cell in the body unlocking enormous research potential. Combined with the recent discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 endonucleases in bacteria and their modification for use in biomedical research, these methods have the potential to revolutionize the field of genetic engineering and open the door to generating in vitro models that more closely resemble the in vivo system than ever before. Use of CRISPR/Cas9 has created a whirlwind within the scientific community in the last few years, as the race to move beyond just disease analysis and toward the goal of gene and cell therapy moves further. This review will detail the CRISPR/Cas9 method and its use in stem cells as well as highlight recent studies that demonstrate its use in creating robust disease models. Finally, recent results and current controversies in the field are reviewed and lingering challenges to further development are explored. J. Cell.

31963556        	Emerging Roles of Cancer Stem Cells in Bladder Cancer Progression, Tumorigenesis, and Resistance to Chemotherapy: A Potential Therapeutic Target for Bladder Cancer.            	Bladder cancer (BC) is a complex and highly heterogeneous stem cell disease associated with high morbidity and mortality rates if it is not treated properly. Early diagnosis with personalized therapy and regular follow-up are the keys to a successful outcome. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the leading power behind tumor growth, with the ability of self-renewal, metastasis, and resistance to conventional chemotherapy. The fast-developing CSC field with robust genome-wide screening methods has found a platform for establishing more reliable therapies to target tumor-initiating cell populations. However, the high heterogeneity of the CSCs in BC disease remains a large issue. Therefore, in the present review, we discuss the various types of bladder CSC heterogeneity, important regulatory pathways, roles in tumor progression and tumorigenesis, and the experimental culture models. Finally, we describe the current stem cell-based therapies for BC disease.	
27728805        	N-Myc Induces an EZH2-Mediated Transcriptional Program Driving Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.            	The transition from castration-resistant prostate adenocarcinoma (CRPC) to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) has emerged as an important mechanism of treatment resistance. NEPC is associated with overexpression and gene amplification of MYCN (encoding N-Myc). N-Myc is an established oncogene in several rare pediatric tumors, but its role in prostate cancer progression is not well established. Integrating a genetically engineered mouse model and human prostate cancer transcriptome data, we show that N-Myc overexpression leads to the development of poorly differentiated, invasive prostate cancer that is molecularly similar to human NEPC. This includes an abrogation of androgen receptor signaling and induction of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 signaling. Altogether, our data establishes N-Myc as an oncogenic driver of NEPC.                Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
31723594        	Pleural Effusion Aspirate for use in 3D Lung Cancer Modeling and Chemotherapy Screening.            	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide yet in vitro disease models have been limited to traditional 2D culture utilizing cancer cell lines. In contrast, recently developed 3D models (organoids) have been adopted by researchers to improve the physiological relevance of laboratory study. We have hypothesized that 3D hydrogel-based models will allow for improved disease replication and characterization over standard 2D culture using cells taken directly from patients. Here, we have leveraged the use of 3D hydrogel-based models to create lung cancer organoids using a unique cell source, pleural effusion aspirate, from multiple lung cancer patients. With these 3D models, we have characterized the cell populations comprising the pleural effusion aspirate and have tracked phenotypic changes that develop during short-term in vitro culture. We found that isolated, patient cells placed directly into organoids created anatomically relevant structures and exhibited lung cancer specific behaviors. On the other hand, cells first grown in plastic dishes and then cultured in 3D did not create similar structures. Further, we have been able to compare chemotherapeutic response of patient cells between 2D and 3D cell culture systems. Our results show that cells in 2D culture were more sensitive to treatment when compared with 3D organoids. Collectively, we have been able to utilize tumor cells from pleural effusion fluid of lung cancer patients to create organoids that display in vivo like anatomy and drug response and thus could serve as more accurate disease models for study of tumor progression and drug development.	
29472497        	ADAM17 is required for EGF-R-induced intestinal tumors via IL-6 trans-signaling.            	Colorectal cancer is treated with antibodies blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), but therapeutic success is limited. EGF-R is stimulated by soluble ligands, which are derived from transmembrane precursors by ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage. In mouse intestinal cancer models in the absence of ADAM17, tumorigenesis was almost completely inhibited, and the few remaining tumors were of low-grade dysplasia. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated down-regulation of STAT3 and Wnt pathway components. Because EGF-R on myeloid cells, but not on intestinal epithelial cells, is required for intestinal cancer and because IL-6 is induced via EGF-R stimulation, we analyzed the role of IL-6 signaling. Tumor formation was equally impaired in IL-6-/- mice and sgp130Fc transgenic mice, in which only trans-signaling via soluble IL-6R is abrogated. ADAM17 is needed for EGF-R-mediated induction of IL-6 synthesis, which via IL-6 trans-signaling induces β-catenin-dependent tumorigenesis. Our data reveal the possibility of a novel strategy for treatment of colorectal cancer that could circumvent intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGF-R blockade.                © 2018 Crown copyright.

27923766        	Single-Cell Analysis Uncovers Clonal Acinar Cell Heterogeneity in the Adult Pancreas.            	Acinar cells make up the majority of all cells in the pancreas, yet the source of new acinar cells during homeostasis remains unknown. Using multicolor lineage-tracing and organoid-formation assays, we identified the presence of a progenitor-like acinar cell subpopulation. These cells have long-term self-renewal capacity, albeit in a unipotent fashion. We further demonstrate that binuclear acinar cells are terminally differentiated acinar cells. Transcriptome analysis of single acinar cells revealed the existence of a minor population of cells expressing progenitor markers. Interestingly, a gain of the identified markers accompanied by a transient gain of proliferation was observed following chemically induced pancreatitis. Altogether, our study identifies a functionally and molecularly distinct acinar subpopulation and thus transforms our understanding of the acinar cell compartment as a pool of equipotent secretory cells.

29752411        	Differential activities and mechanisms of the four R-spondins in potentiating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.            	The four R-spondins (RSPO1-4) strongly potentiate Wnt signaling and play critical roles in normal development, adult stem cell survival, and cancer development and aggressiveness. All four RSPOs have been suggested to potentiate Wnt signaling by binding to three related receptors, i.e. leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptors 4, 5, and 6 (LGR4/5/6), and then inducing the clearance of two E3 ubiquitin ligases (RNF43 and ZNRF3) that otherwise would ubiquitinate Wnt receptors for degradation. Here, we show that RSPO1-4 have differential dependence on LGRs in potentiating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and that RSPO2 can enhance this pathway without any LGR. LGR4 knockout (LGR4KO) in HEK293 cells completely abrogated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling response to RSPO1 and RSPO4 and strongly impaired the response to RSPO3. RSPO2, however, retained robust activity albeit with decreased potency. Complete rescue of RSPO1-4 activity in LGR4KO cells required the seven-transmembrane domain of LGR4. Furthermore, an RSPO2 mutant with normal binding affinity to ZNRF3 but no or little binding to LGR4 or LGR5 still potentiated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vitro, supported the growth of intestinal organoids ex vivo, and stimulated intestinal crypt growth in vivo Mechanistically, RSPO2 could increase Wnt receptor levels in the absence of any LGR without affecting ZNRF3 endocytosis and stability. These findings suggest that RSPO1-4 use distinct mechanisms in regulating Wnt and other signaling pathways, which have important implications for understanding the pleiotropic functions of RSPOs and LGRs in both normal and cancer development.                © 2018 Park et al.	
31988297        	Lipid desaturation-associated endoplasmic reticulum stress regulates MYCN gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.            	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide due to its high rate of recurrence, in part because of cancer stem cell (CSC)-dependent "field cancerization". Recently, we identified that the oncogene v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog (MYCN) marked CSC-like subpopulations in heterogeneous HCC and served as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker for HCC. In this study, we explored the molecular basis of upregulated MYCN gene expression in HCC cells. Liquid chromatograph time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolome analysis demonstrated that the content of unsaturated fatty acids was increased in MYCN high expression (MYCNhigh) CSC-like HCC cells. Inhibition of lipid desaturation using either the chemical inhibitor or siRNA/shRNA against stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) suppressed cell proliferation as well as MYCN gene expression in MYCNhigh HCC cells, grown as both monolayer and spheres. Further mechanistic study using RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related signaling networks such as endocannabinoid cancer inhibition pathway were under the control of SCD1 in MYCNhigh HCC cells. Furthermore, the expression of ER stress-inducible transcription suppressor cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF3) was downregulated in MYCNhigh CSC-like HCC cells and CSC-rich spheroids, which was upregulated by inhibition of lipid desaturation or treatment with acyclic retinoid (ACR). Lipid profiling using NMR spectroscopy revealed that the ACR dramatically reduced the content of unsaturated fatty acids in HCC cells. The chemical inducer of ER stress inhibited MYCN gene expression, while the chemical inhibitor of ER stress or knockdown of ATF3 gene expression partially rescued the suppression of MYCN gene expression by ACR in MYCNhigh HCC cells. These data suggested that lipid desaturation-mediated ER stress signaling regulates MYCN gene expression in HCC cells and serves as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of HCC.	
30744076        	Identification of Cross Talk between FoxM1 and RASSF1A as a Therapeutic Target of Colon Cancer.            	Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is characterized by the expression of cellular oncogenes, the loss of tumor suppressor gene function. Therefore, identifying integrated signaling between onco-suppressor genes may facilitate the development of effective therapy for mCRC. To investigate these pathways we utilized cell lines and patient derived organoid models for analysis of gene/protein expression, gene silencing, overexpression, and immunohistochemical analyses. An inverse relationship in expression of oncogenic FoxM1 and tumor suppressor RASSF1A was observed in various stages of CRC. This inverse correlation was also observed in mCRC cells lines (T84, Colo 205) treated with Akt inhibitor. Inhibition of FoxM1 expression in mCRC cells as well as in our ex vivo model resulted in increased RASSF1A expression. Reduced levels of RASSF1A expression were found in normal cells (RWPE-1, HBEpc, MCF10A, EC) stimulated with exogenous VEGF165. Downregulation of FoxM1 also coincided with increased YAP phosphorylation, indicative of tumor suppression. Conversely, downregulation of RASSF1A coincided with FoxM1 overexpression. These studies have identified for the first time an integrated signaling pathway between FoxM1 and RASSF1A in mCRC progression, which may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic options for advanced colon cancer therapy.	
32251397        	Zebrafish patient avatars in cancer biology and precision cancer therapy.            	In precision oncology, two major strategies are being pursued for predicting clinically relevant tumour behaviours, such as treatment response and emergence of drug resistance: inference based on genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and/or proteomic analysis of patient samples, and phenotypic assays in personalized cancer avatars. The latter approach has historically relied on in vivo mouse xenografts and in vitro organoids or 2D cell cultures. Recent progress in rapid combinatorial genetic modelling, the development of a genetically immunocompromised strain for xenotransplantation of human patient samples in adult zebrafish and the first clinical trial using xenotransplantation in zebrafish larvae for phenotypic testing of drug response bring this tiny vertebrate to the forefront of the precision medicine arena. In this Review, we discuss advances in transgenic and transplantation-based zebrafish cancer avatars, and how these models compare with and complement mouse xenografts and human organoids. We also outline the unique opportunities that these different models present for prediction studies and current challenges they face for future clinical deployment.	
27510096        	NO• and Pancreatic Cancer: A Complex Interaction with Therapeutic Potential.            	Pancreatic tumors express high level of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) in particular inducible (iNOS/NOS2) and endothelial (eNOS/NOS3) forms. However, the role of nitric oxide (NO•) in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer is not clearly defined. Delineating the NO•-induced signaling in pancreatic cancer and its potential contribution in disease aggressiveness may provide therapeutic targets to improve survival in this lethal malignancy. Recent Advances: An increased expression of NOS2/iNOS in tumors is associated with poorer survival in early stage resected patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Furthermore, genetic deletion of NOS2 enhanced survival in mice with autochthonous PDAC. Additionally, targeting NOS3/eNOS reduced the abundance of precursor lesions in mice, which trended toward improved survival.                The extremely poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer is due to the late diagnosis and lack of effective therapy in advanced disease. One of the most critical issues is to decipher the underlying mechanism of disease aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance for identifying potential therapeutic target and effective treatment. Given the evidence of a strong association between inflammation and pancreatic cancer and clinical evidence, which suggests an association between NOS2 and disease aggressiveness, it is critical to define the role of NO• signaling in this lethal malignancy.                Recent preclinical and clinical evidences indicate a potential therapeutic significance of targeting NO• signaling in pancreatic cancer. With the emergence of new preclinical models, including the patient-derived organoids, further preclinical evaluation using clinically tested NOS inhibitors is needed for designing future clinical investigation.

31715015        	Large-Scale Production of LGR5-Positive Bipotential Human Liver Stem Cells.            	The gap between patients on transplant waiting lists and available donor organs is steadily increasing. Human organoids derived from leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5)-positive adult stem cells represent an exciting new cell source for liver regeneration; however, culturing large numbers of organoids with current protocols is tedious and the level of hepatic differentiation is limited.                Here, we established a method for the expansion of large quantities of human liver organoids in spinner flasks. Due to improved oxygenation in the spinner flasks, organoids rapidly proliferated and reached an average 40-fold cell expansion after 2 weeks, compared with 6-fold expansion in static cultures. The organoids repopulated decellularized liver discs and formed liver-like tissue. After differentiation in spinner flasks, mature hepatocyte markers were highly up-regulated compared with static organoid cultures, and cytochrome p450 activity reached levels equivalent to hepatocytes.                We established a highly efficient method for culturing large numbers of LGR5-positive stem cells in the form of organoids, which paves the way for the application of organoids for tissue engineering and liver transplantation.                © 2019 The Authors.

30006147        	Pluripotent Stem Cell Platforms for Drug Discovery.            	Use of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and their differentiated derivatives have led to recent proof-of-principle drug discoveries, defining a pathway to the implementation of hPSC-based drug discovery (hPDD). Current hPDD strategies, however, have inevitable conceptual biases and technological limitations, including the dimensionality of cell-culture methods, cell maturity and functionality, experimental variability, and data reproducibility. In this review, we dissect representative hPDD systems via analysis of hPSC-based 2D-monolayers, 3D culture, and organoids. We discuss mechanisms of drug discovery and drug repurposing, and roles of membrane drug transporters in tissue maturation and hPDD using the example of drugs that target various mutations of CFTR, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, in patients with cystic fibrosis.

33325234        	Label-Free Quantification of Cell Cycle Synchronicity of Human Neural Progenitor Cells Based on Electrophysiology Phenotypes.            	The ability to coax human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) can lead to novel drug discovery and transplant therapy platforms for neurological diseases. Since hNPCs can form organoids that mimic brain development, there is emerging interest in their label-free characterization for controlling cell composition to optimize organoid formation in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. However, this requires the ability to quantify hNPCs in heterogeneous samples with subpopulations of similar phenotype. Using high-throughput (>6000 cells per condition), single-cell impedance cytometry, we present the utilization of electrophysiology for quantification of hNPC subpopulations that are altered in cell cycle synchronicity by camptothecin (CPT) exposure. Electrophysiology phenotypes are determined from impedance magnitude and phase metrics for distinguishing each cell cycle phase, as validated by flow cytometry, for a wide range of subpopulation proportions. Using multishell dielectric models for each cell cycle phase, electrophysiology alterations with CPT dose could be predicted. This label-free detection strategy can prevent loss of cell viability to speed the optimization of cellular compositions for organoid development.	
28273069        	Interplay between metabolic identities in the intestinal crypt supports stem cell function.            	The small intestinal epithelium self-renews every four or five days. Intestinal stem cells (Lgr5+ crypt base columnar cells (CBCs)) sustain this renewal and reside between terminally differentiated Paneth cells at the bottom of the intestinal crypt. Whereas the signalling requirements for maintaining stem cell function and crypt homeostasis have been well studied, little is known about how metabolism contributes to epithelial homeostasis. Here we show that freshly isolated Lgr5+ CBCs and Paneth cells from the mouse small intestine display different metabolic programs. Compared to Paneth cells, Lgr5+ CBCs display high mitochondrial activity. Inhibition of mitochondrial activity in Lgr5+ CBCs or inhibition of glycolysis in Paneth cells strongly affects stem cell function, as indicated by impaired organoid formation. In addition, Paneth cells support stem cell function by providing lactate to sustain the enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the Lgr5+ CBCs. Mechanistically, we show that oxidative phosphorylation stimulates p38 MAPK activation by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species signalling, thereby establishing the mature crypt phenotype. Together, our results reveal a critical role for the metabolic identity of Lgr5+ CBCs and Paneth cells in supporting optimal stem cell function, and we identify mitochondria and reactive oxygen species signalling as a driving force of cellular differentiation.	
30655319        	Serine Threonine Kinase 17A Maintains the Epithelial State in Colorectal Cancer Cells.            	Serine threonine kinase 17A (STK17A) is a ubiquitously expressed kinase originally identified as a regulator of apoptosis; however, whether it functionally contributes to colorectal cancer has not been established. Here, we have analyzed STK17A in colorectal cancer and demonstrated decreased expression of STK17A in primary tumors, which is further reduced in metastatic lesions, indicating a potential role in regulating the metastatic cascade. Interestingly, changes in STK17A expression did not modify proliferation, apoptosis, or sensitivity of colorectal cancer cell lines to treatment with the chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil. Instead, STK17A knockdown induced a robust mesenchymal phenotype consistent with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, including spindle-like cell morphology, decreased expression of adherens junction proteins, and increased migration and invasion. Additionally, overexpression of STK17A decreased cell size and induced widespread membrane blebbing, a phenotype often associated with activation of cell contractility. Indeed, STK17A-overexpressing cells displayed heightened phosphorylation of myosin light chain in a manner dependent on STK17A catalytic activity. Finally, patient-derived tumor organoid cultures were used to more accurately determine STK17A's effect in primary human tumor cells. Loss of STK17A induced morphologic changes, decreased E-cadherin, increased invasion, and augmented organoid attachment on 2D substrates, all together suggesting a more metastatic phenotype. Collectively, these data indicate a novel role for STK17A in the regulation of epithelial phenotypes and indicate its functional contribution to colorectal cancer invasion and metastasis. IMPLICATIONS: Loss of serine threonine kinase 17A occurs in colorectal cancer metastasis, induces mesenchymal morphologies, and contributes to tumor cell invasion and migration in colorectal cancer.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
25290188        	Tripartite interactions between Wnt signaling, Notch and Myb for stem/progenitor cell functions during intestinal tumorigenesis.            	Deletion studies confirm Wnt, Notch and Myb transcriptional pathway engagement in intestinal tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, their contrasting and combined roles when activated have not been elucidated. This is important as these pathways are not ablated but rather are aberrantly activated during carcinogenesis. Using ApcMin/+ mice as a source of organoids we documented their transition, on a clone-by-clone basis, to cyst-like spheres with constitutively activated Wnt pathway, increased self-renewal and growth and reduced differentiation. We then looked at this transition when Myb and/or Notch1 are activated. Activated Notch promoted cyst-like organoids. Conversely growth and propagation of cyst-like, but not normal organoids were Notch-independent. Activated Myb promoted normal, but not cyst-like organoids. Interestingly the Wnt, Notch and Myb pathways were all involved in regulating the expression of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) gene Lgr5 in organoids, while ISC gene and Notch target Olfm4 was dominantly repressed by Wnt. These findings parallel mouse intestinal adenoma formation where Notch promoted the initiation, but not growth, of Wnt-driven Olfm4-repressed colon tumors. Also Myb was essential for colon tumor initiation and collateral mouse pathologies. These data reveal the complex interplay and hierarchy of transcriptional networks that operate in ISCs and uncover a shift in pathway-dependencies during tumor initiation.

23618903        	The Myb-p300-CREB axis modulates intestine homeostasis, radiosensitivity and tumorigenesis.            	The gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium is constantly renewing, depending upon the intestinal stem cells (ISC) regulated by a spectrum of transcription factors (TFs), including Myb. We noted previously in mice with a p300 mutation (plt6) within the Myb-interaction-domain phenocopied Myb hypomorphic mutant mice with regard to thrombopoiesis, and here, changes in GI homeostasis. p300 is a transcriptional coactivator for many TFs, most prominently cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and also Myb. Studies have highlighted the importance of CREB in proliferation and radiosensitivity, but not in the GI. This prompted us to directly investigate the p300-Myb-CREB axis in the GI. Here, the role of CREB has been defined by generating GI-specific inducible creb knockout (KO) mice. KO mice show efficient and specific deletion of CREB, with no evident compensation by CREM and ATF1. Despite complete KO, only modest effects on proliferation, radiosensitivity and differentiation in the GI under homeostatic or stress conditions were evident, even though CREB target gene pcna (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) was downregulated. creb and p300 mutant lines show increased goblet cells, whereas a reduction in enteroendocrine cells was apparent only in the p300 line, further resembling the Myb hypomorphs. When propagated in vitro, crebKO ISC were defective in organoid formation, suggesting that the GI stroma compensates for CREB loss in vivo, unlike in MybKO studies. Thus, it appears that p300 regulates GI differentiation primarily through Myb, rather than CREB. Finally, active pCREB is elevated in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and adenomas, and is required for the expression of drug transporter, MRP2, associated with resistance to Oxaliplatin as well as several chromatin cohesion protein that are relevant to CRC therapy. These data raise the prospect that CREB may have a role in GI malignancy as it does in other cancer types, but unlike Myb, is not critical for GI homeostasis.	
26628377        	Identification of Different Classes of Luminal Progenitor Cells within Prostate Tumors.            	Primary prostate cancer almost always has a luminal phenotype. However, little is known about the stem/progenitor properties of transformed cells within tumors. Using the aggressive Pten/Tp53-null mouse model of prostate cancer, we show that two classes of luminal progenitors exist within a tumor. Not only did tumors contain previously described multipotent progenitors, but also a major population of committed luminal progenitors. Luminal cells, sorted directly from tumors or grown as organoids, initiated tumors of adenocarcinoma or multilineage histological phenotypes, which is consistent with luminal and multipotent differentiation potentials, respectively. Moreover, using organoids we show that the ability of luminal-committed progenitors to self-renew is a tumor-specific property, absent in benign luminal cells. Finally, a significant fraction of luminal progenitors survived in vivo castration. In all, these data reveal two luminal tumor populations with different stem/progenitor cell capacities, providing insight into prostate cancer cells that initiate tumors and can influence treatment response.

21571313        	Murine tissue-engineered stomach demonstrates epithelial differentiation.            	Gastric cancer remains the second largest cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Postgastrectomy morbidity is considerable and quality of life is poor. Tissue-engineered stomach is a potential replacement solution to restore adequate food reservoir and gastric physiology. In this study, we performed a detailed investigation of the development of tissue-engineered stomach in a mouse model, specifically evaluating epithelial differentiation, proliferation, and the presence of putative stem cell markers.                Organoid units were isolated from <3 wk-old mouse glandular stomach and seeded onto biodegradable scaffolds. The constructs were implanted into the omentum of adult mice. Implants were harvested at designated time points and analyzed with histology and immunohistochemistry.                Tissue-engineered stomach grows as an expanding sphere with a simple columnar epithelium organized into gastric glands and an adjacent muscularis. The regenerated gastric epithelium demonstrates differentiation of all four cell types: mucous, enteroendocrine, chief, and parietal cells. Tissue-engineered stomach epithelium proliferates at a rate comparable to native glandular stomach and expresses two putative stem cell markers: DCAMKL-1 and Lgr5.                This study demonstrates the successful generation of tissue-engineered stomach in a mouse model for the first time. Regenerated gastric epithelium is able to appropriately proliferate and differentiate. The generation of murine tissue-engineered stomach is a necessary advance as it provides the transgenic tools required to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this regenerative process. Delineating the mechanism of how tissue-engineered stomach develops in vivo is an important precursor to its use as a human stomach replacement therapy.                Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

30669516        	Application of Prostate Cancer Models for Preclinical Study: Advantages and Limitations of Cell Lines, Patient-Derived Xenografts, and Three-Dimensional Culture of Patient-Derived Cells.            	Various preclinical models have been developed to clarify the pathophysiology of prostate cancer (PCa). Traditional PCa cell lines from clinical metastatic lesions, as exemplified by DU-145, PC-3, and LNCaP cells, are useful tools to define mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Cell line-based experiments, however, have limitations for preclinical studies because those cells are basically adapted to 2-dimensional monolayer culture conditions, in which the majority of primary PCa cells cannot survive. Recent tissue engineering enables generation of PCa patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from both primary and metastatic lesions. Compared with fresh PCa tissue transplantation in athymic mice, co-injection of PCa tissues with extracellular matrix in highly immunodeficient mice has remarkably improved the success rate of PDX generation. PDX models have advantages to appropriately recapitulate the molecular diversity, cellular heterogeneity, and histology of original patient tumors. In contrast to PDX models, patient-derived organoid and spheroid PCa models in 3-dimensional culture are more feasible tools for in vitro studies for retaining the characteristics of patient tumors. In this article, we review PCa preclinical model cell lines and their sublines, PDXs, and patient-derived organoid and spheroid models. These PCa models will be applied to the development of new strategies for cancer precision medicine.	
33318207        	Inhibition of GCK-IV kinases dissociates cell death and axon regeneration in CNS neurons.            	Axon injury is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, often resulting in neuronal cell death and functional impairment. Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) has emerged as a key mediator of this process. However, while DLK inhibition is robustly protective in a wide range of neurodegenerative disease models, it also inhibits axonal regeneration. Indeed, there are no genetic perturbations that are known to both improve long-term survival and promote regeneration. To identify such a neuroprotective target, we conducted a set of complementary high-throughput screens using a protein kinase inhibitor library in human stem cell-derived retinal ganglion cells (hRGCs). Overlapping compounds that promoted both neuroprotection and neurite outgrowth were bioinformatically deconvoluted to identify specific kinases that regulated neuronal death and axon regeneration. This work identified the role of germinal cell kinase four (GCK-IV) kinases in cell death and additionally revealed their unexpected activity in suppressing axon regeneration. Using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) approach, coupled with genome editing, we validated that GCK-IV kinase knockout improves neuronal survival, comparable to that of DLK knockout, while simultaneously promoting axon regeneration. Finally, we also found that GCK-IV kinase inhibition also prevented the attrition of RGCs in developing retinal organoid cultures without compromising axon outgrowth, addressing a major issue in the field of stem cell-derived retinas. Together, these results demonstrate a role for the GCK-IV kinases in dissociating the cell death and axonal outgrowth in neurons and their druggability provides for therapeutic options for neurodegenerative diseases.

28507600        	Insights into the role of the intestinal microbiota in colon cancer.            	The intestinal microbiota consists of a dynamic organization of bacteria, viruses, archaea, and fungal species essential for maintaining gut homeostasis and protecting the host against pathogenic invasion. When dysregulated, the intestinal microbiota can contribute to colorectal cancer development. Though the microbiota is multifaceted in its ability to induce colorectal cancer, this review will focus on the capability of the microbiota to induce colorectal cancer through the modulation of immune function and the production of microbial-derived metabolites. We will also explore an experimental technique that is revolutionizing intestinal research. By elucidating the interactions of microbial species with epithelial tissue, and allowing for drug screening of patients with colorectal cancers, organoid development is a novel culturing technique that is innovating intestinal research. As a cancer that remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, it is imperative that scientific findings are translated into the creation of effective therapeutics to treat colorectal cancer.	
29599906        	Dynamic changes during the treatment of pancreatic cancer.            	This manuscript follows a single patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma for a five year period, detailing the clinical record, pathology, the dynamic evolution of molecular and cellular alterations as well as the responses to treatments with chemotherapies, targeted therapies and immunotherapies. DNA and RNA samples from biopsies and blood identified a dynamic set of changes in allelic imbalances and copy number variations in response to therapies. Organoid cultures established from biopsies over time were employed for extensive drug testing to determine if this approach was feasible for treatments. When an unusual drug response was detected, an extensive RNA sequencing analysis was employed to establish novel mechanisms of action of this drug. Organoid cell cultures were employed to identify possible antigens associated with the tumor and the patient's T-cells were expanded against one of these antigens. Similar and identical T-cell receptor sequences were observed in the initial biopsy and the expanded T-cell population. Immunotherapy treatment failed to shrink the tumor, which had undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition prior to therapy. A warm autopsy of the metastatic lung tumor permitted an extensive analysis of tumor heterogeneity over five years of treatment and surgery. This detailed analysis of the clinical descriptions, imaging, pathology, molecular and cellular evolution of the tumors, treatments, and responses to chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies, as well as attempts at the development of personalized medical treatments for a single patient should provide a valuable guide to future directions in cancer treatment.

31937589        	Cell adhesion in cancer: Beyond the migration of single cells.            	Homeostasis in healthy tissues strongly relies on cell-to-cell adhesion and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions. For instance, normal epithelial cells maintain tissue structure by adhering to each other and to the extracellular matrix. The proteins that mediate these distinct interactions are collectively called cell adhesion molecules and are divided into four major groups: cadherins, integrins, selectins, and immunoglobulins. They not only physically anchor cells, but also critically integrate signaling between the extracellular microenvironment and cells. These signals include biochemical cues, as adhesion proteins can both act as ligand-activated receptors and activate mechanotransduction triggered by changes in the physical environment. Molecular mechanisms related to cell adhesion signaling have been extensively studied, especially because mutations and changes in expression of these proteins, particularly cadherins and integrins, are frequently associated with diseases ranging from developmental intellectual disability to cancer. In fact, two major hallmarks of cancer, loss of cell-to-cell adhesion and anchorage-independent growth, are both dependent on cell adhesion molecules. Despite many studies elucidating the relationships between malignant transformation and metastasis and cellular adhesion processes, several areas still await exploration. Here, we highlight recently discovered roles of adhesion molecules in collective cancer cell migration and discuss the utility of three-dimensional models in studying cell-cell adhesion. We also describe recent therapeutic approaches targeting adhesion molecules.                © 2020 Janiszewska et al.

30172452        	Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells for models of cancer and cancer stem cell research.            	Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are embryonic stem cell-like cells reprogrammed from somatic cells by four transcription factors, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. iPSCs derived from cancer cells (cancer-iPSCs) could be a novel strategy for studying cancer. During cancer cell reprogramming, the epigenetic status of the cancer cell may be altered, such that it acquires stemness and pluripotency. The cellular behavior of the reprogrammed cells exhibits dynamic changes during the different stages of reprogramming. The cells may acquire the properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs) during the process of reprogramming, and lose their carcinogenic properties during reprogramming into a cancer-iPSCs. Differentiation of cancer-iPSCs by teratoma formation or organoid culturing could mimic the process of tumorigenesis. Some of the molecular mechanisms associated with cancer progression could be elucidated using the cancer-iPSC model. Furthermore, cancer-iPSCs could be expanded in culture system or bioreactors, and serve as cell sources for research, and as personal disease models for therapy and drug screening. This article introduces cancer studies that used the cell reprogramming strategy.                Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.	
31020445        	Development of a Colorectal Cancer 3D Micro-tumor Construct Platform From Cell Lines and Patient Tumor Biospecimens for Standard-of-Care and Experimental Drug Screening.            	Colorectal cancer is subject to a high rate of mutations, with late stage tumors often containing many mutations. These tumors are difficult to treat, and even with the recently implemented methods of personalized medicine at modern hospitals aiming to narrow treatments, a gap still exists. Proper modeling of these tumors may help to recommend optimal treatments for individual patients, preferably utilizing a model that maintains proper signaling in respect to the derived parent tissue. In this study, we utilized an extracellular matrix-derived hydrogel to create a 3D micro-tumor construct platform capable of both supporting cells for long time durations and for high throughput drug screening. Experiments with cell lines demonstrated long-term viability with maintenance of cell proliferation. Furthermore, studies with several chemotherapeutics utilizing different mechanisms of action displayed differences in efficacy in comparing 3D and 2D cultures. Finally, patient colorectal tumor tissue was acquired and employed to reconstruct micro-tumor constructs, providing a system for the testing of novel chemotherapeutics against tumors in a patient-specific manner. Collectively, the results describe a system capable of high throughput testing while maintaining important characteristics of the parent tissue.	
23890787        	A senescence-inflammatory switch from cancer-inhibitory to cancer-promoting mechanism.            	Senescence, perceived as a cancer barrier, is paradoxically associated with inflammation, which promotes tumorigenesis. Here, we characterize a distinct low-grade inflammatory process in stressed epithelium that is related to para-inflammation; this process either represses or promotes tumorigenesis, depending on p53 activity. Csnk1a1 (CKIα) downregulation induces a senescence-associated inflammatory response (SIR) with growth arrest in colorectal tumors, which loses its growth control capacity in the absence of p53 and instead, accelerates growth and invasiveness. Corresponding processes occur in CKIα-deleted intestinal organoids, assuming tumorigenic transformation properties ex vivo, upon p53 loss. Treatment of organoids and mice with anti-inflammatory agents suppresses the SIR and prevents p53-deficient organoid transformation and mouse carcinogenesis. SIR/para-inflammation suppression may therefore constitute a key mechanism in the anticarcinogenic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.                Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

31988296        	Human BCL-G regulates secretion of inflammatory chemokines but is dispensable for induction of apoptosis by IFN-γ and TNF-α in intestinal epithelial cells.            	Proteins of the BCL-2 family are evolutionarily conserved modulators of apoptosis that function as sensors of cellular integrity. Over the past three decades multiple BCL-2 family members have been identified, many of which are now fully incorporated into regulatory networks governing the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. For some, however, an exact role in cell death signalling remains unclear. One such 'orphan' BCL-2 family member is BCL-G (or BCL2L14). In this study we analysed gastrointestinal expression of human BCL-G in health and disease states, and investigated its contribution to inflammation-induced tissue damage by exposing intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) to IFN-γ and TNF-α, two pro-inflammatory mediators associated with gut immunopathology. We found that both BCL-G splice variants - BCL-GS (short) and BCL-GL (long) - were highly expressed in healthy gut tissue, and that their mRNA levels decreased in active inflammatory bowel diseases (for BCL-GS) and colorectal cancer (for BCL-GS/L). In vitro studies revealed that IFN-γ and TNF-α synergised to upregulate BCL-GS/L and to trigger apoptosis in colonic epithelial cell lines and primary human colonic organoids. Using RNAi, we showed that synergistic induction of IEC death was STAT1-dependent while optimal expression of BCL-GS/L required STAT1, NF-κB/p65 and SWI/SNF-associated chromatin remodellers BRM and BRG1. To test the direct contribution of BCL-G to the effects of IFN-γ and TNF-α on epithelial cells, we used RNAi- and CRISPR/Cas9-based perturbations in parallel with isoform-specific overexpression of BCL-G, and found that BCL-G was dispensable for Th1 cytokine-induced apoptosis of human IEC. Instead, we discovered that depletion of BCL-G differentially affected secretion of inflammatory chemokines CCL5 and CCL20, thus uncovering a non-apoptotic immunoregulatory function of this BCL-2 family member. Taken together, our data indicate that BCL-G may be involved in shaping immune responses in the human gut in health and disease states through regulation of chemokine secretion rather than intestinal apoptosis.

32307765        	MicroRNA-93 targets WASF3 and functions as a metastasis suppressor in breast cancer.            	Cancer cells with cancer stem cell (CSC) properties initiate both primary tumor formation and metastases at distant sites. Acquisition of CSC properties is highly associated with epigenetic alterations, including those mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs). We have previously established the breast cancer patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) mouse model in which CSC marker CD44+ cancer cells formed spontaneous microscopic metastases in the liver. In this PDX mouse, we found that the expression levels of 3 miRNAs (miR-25, miR-93, and miR-106b) in the miR-106b-25 cluster were much lower in the CD44+ human cancer cells metastasized to the liver than those at the primary site. Constitutive overexpression of miR-93 suppressed invasive ability and 3D-organoid formation capacity of breast cancer cells in vitro and significantly suppressed their metastatic ability to the liver in vivo. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family member 3 (WASF3), a regulator of both cytoskeleton remodeling and CSC properties, was identified as a functional target of miR-93: overexpression of miR-93 reduced the protein level of WASF3 in breast cancer cells and WASF3 rescued the miR-93-mediated suppression of breast cancer cell invasion. These findings suggest that miR-93 functions as a metastasis suppressor by suppressing both invasion ability and CSC properties in breast cancers.                © 2020 The Authors.

Experimental cell research studying three-dimensional (3D) tissues in space and on Earth using new techniques to simulate microgravity is currently a hot topic in Gravitational Biology and Biomedicine. This review will focus on the current knowledge of the use of stem cells and specialized cells for tissue engineering under simulated microgravity conditions. We will report on recent advancements in the ability to construct 3D aggregates from various cell types using devices originally created to prepare for spaceflights such as the random positioning machine (RPM), the clinostat, or the NASA-developed rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, to engineer various tissues such as preliminary vessels, eye tissue, bone, cartilage, multicellular cancer spheroids, and others from different cells. In addition, stem cells had been investigated under microgravity for the purpose to engineer adipose tissue, cartilage, or bone. Recent publications have discussed different changes of stem cells when exposed to microgravity and the relevant pathways involved in these biological processes. Tissue engineering in microgravity is a new technique to produce organoids, spheroids, or tissues with and without scaffolds. These 3D aggregates can be used for drug testing studies or for coculture models. Multicellular tumor spheroids may be interesting for radiation experiments in the future and to reduce the need for in vivo experiments. Current achievements using cells from patients engineered on the RWV or on the RPM represent an important step in the advancement of techniques that may be applied in translational Regenerative Medicine.

29969439        	Optimized base editors enable efficient editing in cells, organoids and mice.            	CRISPR base editing enables the creation of targeted single-base conversions without generating double-stranded breaks. However, the efficiency of current base editors is very low in many cell types. We reengineered the sequences of BE3, BE4Gam, and xBE3 by codon optimization and incorporation of additional nuclear-localization sequences. Our collection of optimized constitutive and inducible base-editing vector systems dramatically improves the efficiency by which single-nucleotide variants can be created. The reengineered base editors enable target modification in a wide range of mouse and human cell lines, and intestinal organoids. We also show that the optimized base editors mediate efficient in vivo somatic editing in the liver in adult mice.	
33293516        	Tumor derived UBR5 promotes ovarian cancer growth and metastasis through inducing immunosuppressive macrophages.            	Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and ascites-derived spheroids in ovarian cancer (OC) facilitate tumor growth and progression, and also pose major obstacles for cancer therapy. The molecular pathways involved in the OC-TME interactions, how the crosstalk impinges on OC aggression and chemoresistance are not well-characterized. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-derived UBR5, an E3 ligase overexpressed in human OC associated with poor prognosis, is essential for OC progression principally by promoting tumor-associated macrophage recruitment and activation via key chemokines and cytokines. UBR5 is also required to sustain cell-intrinsic β-catenin-mediated signaling to promote cellular adhesion/colonization and organoid formation by controlling the p53 protein level. OC-specific targeting of UBR5 strongly augments the survival benefit of conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapies. This work provides mechanistic insights into the novel oncogene-like functions of UBR5 in regulating the OC-TME crosstalk and suggests that UBR5 is a potential therapeutic target in OC treatment for modulating the TME and cancer stemness.	
28392281        	Human stem cell modeling in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).            	The future of precision medicine is heavily reliant on the use of human tissues to identify the key determinants that account for differences between individuals with the same disorder. This need is exemplified by the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) neurogenetic condition. As such, individuals with NF1 are born with a germline mutation in the NF1 gene, but may develop numerous distinct neurological problems, ranging from autism and attention deficit to brain and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Coupled with accurate preclinical mouse models, the availability of NF1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides new opportunities to define the critical factors that underlie NF1-associated nervous system disease pathogenesis and progression. In this review, we discuss the generation and potential applications of iPSC technology to the study of NF1.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
31733289        	Kinesin family member 15 promotes cancer stem cell phenotype and malignancy via reactive oxygen species imbalance in hepatocellular carcinoma.            	The development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In the present study, kinesin family member 15 (KIF15) expression was shown to be overexpressed in HCC tissues, cell lines, and CSCs. Patients with HCC with high KIF15 expression had shortened overall survival (OS) and high recurrence probability. Downregulation of KIF15 in vitro as well as in HCC organoids resulted in a significant reduction in sphere formation and expression of stemness-related genes. KIF15 downregulation in human HCC xenograft models delayed tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis. KIF15 was also demonstrated to interact with phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and inhibit proteasomal degradation of PHGDH, thus promoting CSC phenotype and malignancy via PHGDH-mediated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) imbalance in HCC. Moreover, AAA nuclear coregulator cancer-associated protein (ANCCA) upregulation acts as a key mediator in KIF15 expression upregulation in HCC. Conclusion: In this study, we found that KIF15 promotes the CSC phenotype and malignancy via PHGDH-mediated ROS imbalance in HCC. These findings highlight potential therapeutic targets for HCC.                Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
28232471        	Distinct populations of inflammatory fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in pancreatic cancer.            	Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that produce desmoplastic stroma, thereby modulating disease progression and therapeutic response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). However, it is unknown whether CAFs uniformly carry out these tasks or if subtypes of CAFs with distinct phenotypes in PDA exist. We identified a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) located immediately adjacent to neoplastic cells in mouse and human PDA tissue. We recapitulated this finding in co-cultures of murine PSCs and PDA organoids, and demonstrated that organoid-activated CAFs produced desmoplastic stroma. The co-cultures showed cooperative interactions and revealed another distinct subpopulation of CAFs, located more distantly from neoplastic cells, which lacked elevated αSMA expression and instead secreted IL6 and additional inflammatory mediators. These findings were corroborated in mouse and human PDA tissue, providing direct evidence for CAF heterogeneity in PDA tumor biology with implications for disease etiology and therapeutic development.                © 2017 Öhlund et al.	
29924747        	Sebaceous Neoplasms With Rippled, Labyrinthine/Sinusoidal, Petaloid, and Carcinoid-Like Patterns: A Study of 57 Cases Validating Their Occurrence as a Morphological Spectrum and Showing No Significant Association With Muir-Torre Syndrome or DNA Mismatch Repair Protein Deficiency.            	Sebaceous neoplasms with an organoid pattern (rippled, labyrinthine/sinusoidal, carcinoid-like, and petaloid) are rare. Previous studies suggested that the above patterns likely represent variations along a morphological continuum. The objectives of this study were to (1) validate this proposition by studying a large number of cases, (2) determine whether there are specific associations with clinical features, (3) establish their frequency, and (4) determine whether they have any association with Muir-Torre syndrome. Fifty-seven sebaceous neoplasms (54 sebaceomas and 3 sebaceous carcinomas) with organoid growth patterns were studied. These occurred in 36 men and 18 women (sex unknown in 3), with ages at diagnosis ranging from 22 to 89 years (mean, 63 years). All patients presented with a solitary nodule (mean size, 11 mm) on the head and neck area. Of the 57 tumors, 24 manifested a single growth pattern, 23 had a combination of 2 patterns, and 10 a combination of 3 patterns, indicating that these patterns are part of a morphological continuum of changes. The carcinoid-like pattern was the most frequent in the "monopatterned" neoplasms (13 cases), whereas the labyrinthine/sinusoidal pattern comprised most of the "polypatterned" lesions, in which various combinations occurred. Immunohistochemically, mismatch repair protein deficiency was detected in 3 of the 22 cases studied, whereas 5 of the 33 patients with available follow-up had an internal malignancy/premalignancy. In conclusion, sebaceous neoplasms with organoid growth patterns are predominantly sebaceomas having a predilection for the scalp, occurring as solitary lesions in elderly patients (male to female ratio of 2:1). Such patterns are expected to be found in a quarter of sebaceomas. In most cases, more than one of the organoid patterns is present. These lesions do not appear to be associated with internal malignancy or mismatch repair deficiency in most cases. However, confirmation of the absence of any significant association with Muir-Torre syndrome syndrome will require genetic studies.	
31585941        	A Comprehensive PDX Gastric Cancer Collection Captures Cancer Cell-Intrinsic Transcriptional MSI Traits.            	Gastric cancer is the world's third leading cause of cancer mortality. In spite of significant therapeutic improvements, the clinical outcome for patients with advanced gastric cancer is poor; thus, the identification and validation of novel targets is extremely important from a clinical point of view. We generated a wide, multilevel platform of gastric cancer models, comprising 100 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), primary cell lines, and organoids. Samples were classified according to their histology, microsatellite stability, Epstein-Barr virus status, and molecular profile. This PDX platform is the widest in an academic institution, and it includes all the gastric cancer histologic and molecular types identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas. PDX histopathologic features were consistent with those of patients' primary tumors and were maintained throughout passages in mice. Factors modulating grafting rate were histology, TNM stage, copy number gain of tyrosine kinases/KRAS genes, and microsatellite stability status. PDX and PDX-derived cells/organoids demonstrated potential usefulness to study targeted therapy response. Finally, PDX transcriptomic analysis identified a cancer cell-intrinsic microsatellite instability (MSI) signature, which was efficiently exported to gastric cancer, allowing the identification, among microsatellite stable (MSS) patients, of a subset of MSI-like tumors with common molecular aspects and significant better prognosis. In conclusion, we generated a wide gastric cancer PDX platform, whose exploitation will help identify and validate novel "druggable" targets and optimize therapeutic strategies. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis of gastric cancer PDXs allowed the identification of a cancer cell-intrinsic MSI signature, recognizing a subset of MSS patients with MSI transcriptional traits, endowed with better prognosis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reports a multilevel platform of gastric cancer PDXs and identifies a MSI gastric signature that could contribute to the advancement of precision medicine in gastric cancer.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

31122284        	Inhibition of RNA polymerase III transcription by Triptolide attenuates colorectal tumorigenesis.            	Upregulation of RNA polymerase (Pol) III products, including tRNAs and 5S rRNA, in tumor cells leads to enhanced protein synthesis and tumor formation, making it a potential target for cancer treatment. In this study, we evaluated the inhibition of Pol III transcription by triptolide and the anti-cancer effect of this drug in colorectal tumorigenesis.                The effect of triptolide on colorectal cancer development was assessed in colorectal cancer mouse models, 3D organoids, and cultured cells. Colorectal cancer cells were treated with triptolide. Pol III transcription was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The formation of TFIIIB, a multi-subunit transcription factor for Pol III, was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).                Triptolide reduced both tumor number and tumor size in adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) mutated (ApcMin/+) mice as well as AOM/DSS-induced mice. Moreover, triptolide effectively inhibited colorectal cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and organoid growth in vitro, which was associated with decreased Pol III target genes. Mechanistically, triptolide treatment blocked TBP/Brf1interaction, leading to the reduced formation of TFIIIB at the promoters of tRNAs and 5S rRNA.                Together, our data suggest that inhibition of Pol III transcription with existing drugs such as triptolide provides a new avenue for developing novel therapies for colorectal cancer.	
29234982        	A Multicellular Model of Intestinal Crypt Buckling and Fission.            	Crypt fission is an in vivo tissue deformation process that is involved in both intestinal homeostasis and colorectal tumourigenesis. Despite its importance, the mechanics underlying crypt fission are currently poorly understood. Recent experimental development of organoids, organ-like buds cultured from crypt stem cells in vitro, has shown promise in shedding light on crypt fission. Drawing inspiration from observations of organoid growth and fission in vivo, we develop a computational model of a deformable epithelial tissue layer. Results from in silico experiments show the stiffness of cells and the proportions of cell subpopulations affect the nature of deformation in the epithelial layer. In particular, we find that increasing the proportion of stiffer cells in the layer increases the likelihood of crypt fission occurring. This is in agreement with and helps explain recent experimental work.	
31302002        	IKKα Kinase Regulates the DNA Damage Response and Drives Chemo-resistance in Cancer.            	Phosphorylated IKKα(p45) is a nuclear active form of the IKKα kinase that is induced by the MAP kinases BRAF and TAK1 and promotes tumor growth independent of canonical NF-κB signaling. Insights into the sources of IKKα(p45) activation and its downstream substrates in the nucleus remain to be defined. Here, we discover that IKKα(p45) is rapidly activated by DNA damage independent of ATM-ATR, but dependent on BRAF-TAK1-p38-MAPK, and is required for robust ATM activation and efficient DNA repair. Abolishing BRAF or IKKα activity attenuates ATM, Chk1, MDC1, Kap1, and 53BP1 phosphorylation, compromises 53BP1 and RIF1 co-recruitment to sites of DNA lesions, and inhibits 53BP1-dependent fusion of dysfunctional telomeres. Furthermore, IKKα or BRAF inhibition synergistically enhances the therapeutic potential of 5-FU and irinotecan to eradicate chemotherapy-resistant metastatic human tumors in vivo. Our results implicate BRAF and IKKα kinases in the DDR and reveal a combination strategy for cancer treatment.                Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

30256256        	A Clinicopathologic and Molecular Analysis of 34 Mediastinal Germ Cell Tumors Suggesting Different Modes of Teratoma Development.            	Mediastinal teratomas are enigmatic; those in children and women are almost invariably benign but in men they may be benign or malignant. There are few data on the chromosome 12p status of mediastinal germ cell tumors (GCT), whereas increased 12p copy number is virtually uniform in malignant testicular GCTs. We therefore studied chromosome 12p copy number in 34 diverse mediastinal GCTs and correlated the results with morphology and follow-up to gain insight into possible pathogenesis. Four prepubertal (below 12 y) children (3 females and 1 male), 7 postpubertal females (14 to 52 y) and 6 postpubertal males (12 to 40 y old) had pure, previously untreated teratomas; 15 were mature and 2 had low-grade immaturity. All lacked 12p copy number increase and cytologic atypia, and most (14/17) showed organoid morphology. On follow-up of 16, 1 died of postoperative complications and the remaining 15 were disease free (1 to 119 mo, mean: 39 mo). Eight postpubertal males (19 to 44 y old) had pure teratomas in postchemotherapy resections; 5/8 showed 12p copy number increase. All 8 had distinct cytologic atypia, with organoid morphology in 3. On follow-up, 6 were disease free after surgical resection (1.5 to 94 mo, mean 38 mo); 1 died of disease at 14.5 months, and 1 was alive with metastases at 176 months. Two postpubertal patients, 1 male (29 y) and 1 female (31 y), had teratoma with secondary somatic-type malignancies, with positive 12p copy number increase in the former but not the latter. The man's tumor occurred after chemotherapy and was a nonorganoid teratoma with primitive neuroectodermal tumor and malignant glioma; the woman's was a previously untreated organoid teratoma with an undifferentiated carcinoma component. The man died of disease (16 mo) and the woman was alive with metastases (27 mo). Seven patients had resections for mixed GCTs (4) or pure nonteratomatous tumors, all after chemotherapy; 5/7 had positive 12p copy number increase. The teratoma component of the 2 cases having one showed distinct cytologic atypia and lacked organoid morphology. On follow-up, 1 died of disease (5 mo), 2 were alive with disease (1, 1.5 mo), 3 were disease free (1 to 43 mo; mean: 18 mo), and 1 was alive with unknown status (31 mo). Our results support that mediastinal teratomas likely develop from 2 separate pathways. Those in children, women and some men arise as pure neoplasms from a nontransformed precursor cell and, therefore, lack 12p copy number increase, show no cytologic atypia, often have organoid morphology and are benign. Common 12p copy number increase, uniform atypia, infrequent organoid structures and malignant behavior support that pure teratomas after chemotherapy in postpubertal males derive from a malignantly transformed precursor cell. Interestingly, we identified organoid pancreatic differentiation only in the benign group and neuroglia more commonly in the malignant teratomas.	
27318148        	ETS-Transcription Factor ETV1 Regulates Stromal Expansion and Metastasis in Pancreatic Cancer.            	The ETS-transcription factor ETV1 is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition during pancreatic development and is induced in mouse pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We investigated the function of ETV1 in stromal expansion of PDAC and metastasis, as well as its effects on a novel downstream target Sparc, which encodes a matricellular protein found in PDAC stroma that has been associated with invasiveness, metastasis and poor patient outcomes.                Pancreatic ductal cells were isolated from Pdx1Cre;Kras(G12D/+) mice (PanIN), Pdx1Cre;Kras(G12D/+);p53(fl/+) and Pdx1Cre;Kras(G12D/+);p53(fl/+);Rosa26(YFP) mice (PDAC), and Pdx1Cre;Kras(G12D/+);p53(fl/+);Sparc(-/-) mice. Cells were grown in 3-dimensional organoid culture to analyze morphology, proliferation, and invasion. Human PanIN and PDAC tissues were evaluated for ETV1 expression. Orthotopic pancreatic transplants of ETV1-overexpressing PDAC and respective control cells were performed.                ETV1 expression was significantly increased in human PanINs and, even more so, in primary and metastatic PDAC. Analyses of mouse orthotopic xenografts revealed that ETV1 induced significantly larger primary tumors than controls, with significantly increased stromal expansion, ascites and metastases. In 3-dimensional organoids, ETV1 disrupted cyst architecture, induced EMT, and increased invasive capacity. Furthermore, we identified Sparc as a novel functional gene target of Etv1 by luciferase assays, and SPARC and ETV1 proteins co-localized in vivo. Disruption of Sparc abrogates the phenotype of stromal expansion and metastasis found with ETV1 overexpression in vivo. We identified hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2) as another novel downstream factor of Etv1; that may mediate ETV1's significant expansion of hyaluronic acid in PDAC stroma. Conversely, disruption of Etv1 in PDAC mice (Pdx1Cre;Kras(G12D/+);p53(fl/+);Rosa26(YFP);Cre;Etv1(fl/fl)) reduced levels of SPARC and hyaluronic acid in the stroma.                ETV1 is critical in the desmoplastic stromal expansion and metastatic progression of pancreatic cancer in mice, mediated functionally in part through Sparc and Has2.

31989583        	Modeling rectal cancer to advance neoadjuvant precision therapy.            	Progress in rectal cancer therapy has been hindered by the lack of effective disease-specific preclinical models that account for the unique molecular profile and biology of rectal cancer. Thus, we developed complementary patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and subsequent in vitro tumor organoid (PDTO) platforms established from preneoadjuvant therapy rectal cancer specimens to advance personalized care for rectal cancer patients. Multiple endoscopic samples were obtained from 26 Stages 2 and 3 rectal cancer patients prior to receiving 5FU/RT and implanted subcutaneously into NSG mice to generate 15 subcutaneous PDXs. Second passaged xenografts demonstrated 100% correlation with the corresponding human cancer histology with maintained mutational profiles. Individual rectal cancer PDXs reproduced the 5FU/RT response observed in the corresponding human cancers. Similarly, rectal cancer PDTOs reproduced significant heterogeneity in cellular morphology and architecture. PDTO in vitro 5FU/RT treatment response replicated the clinical 5FU/RT neoadjuvant therapy pathologic response observed in the corresponding patient tumors (p < 0.05). The addition of cetuximab to the 5FU/RT regiment was significantly more sensitive in the rectal cancer PDX and PDTOs with wild-type KRAS compared to mutated KRAS (p < 0.05). Considering the close relationship between the patient's cancer and the corresponding PDX/PDTO, rectal cancer patient-derived research platforms represent powerful translational research resources as population-based tools for biomarker discovery and experimental therapy testing. In addition, our findings suggest that cetuximab may enhance RT effectiveness by improved patient selection based on mutational profile in addition to KRAS or by developing a protocol using PDTOs to identify sensitive patients.                © 2020 UICC.	
30833775        	Tubuloids derived from human adult kidney and urine for personalized disease modeling.            	Adult stem cell-derived organoids are three-dimensional epithelial structures that recapitulate fundamental aspects of their organ of origin. We describe conditions for the long-term growth of primary kidney tubular epithelial organoids, or 'tubuloids'. The cultures are established from human and mouse kidney tissue and can be expanded for at least 20 passages (>6 months) while retaining a normal number of chromosomes. In addition, cultures can be established from human urine. Human tubuloids represent proximal as well as distal nephron segments, as evidenced by gene expression, immunofluorescence and tubular functional analyses. We apply tubuloids to model infectious, malignant and hereditary kidney diseases in a personalized fashion. BK virus infection of tubuloids recapitulates in vivo phenomena. Tubuloids are established from Wilms tumors. Kidney tubuloids derived from the urine of a subject with cystic fibrosis allow ex vivo assessment of treatment efficacy. Finally, tubuloids cultured on microfluidic organ-on-a-chip plates adopt a tubular conformation and display active (trans-)epithelial transport function.	
28870991        	The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRB negatively regulates FGF2-dependent branching morphogenesis.            	PTPRB is a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase known to regulate blood vessel remodelling and angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that PTPRB negatively regulates branching morphogenesis in the mouse mammary epithelium. We show that Ptprb is highly expressed in adult mammary stem cells and also, although at lower levels, in oestrogen receptor-positive luminal cells. During mammary development, Ptprb expression is downregulated during puberty, a period of extensive ductal outgrowth and branching. In vivo shRNA knockdown of Ptprb in the cleared mammary fat pad transplant assay resulted in smaller epithelial outgrowths with an increased branching density and also increased branching in an in vitro organoid assay. Organoid branching was dependent on stimulation by FGF2, and Ptprb knockdown in mammary epithelial cells resulted in a higher level of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) activation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, both at baseline and following FGF2 stimulation. Therefore, PTPRB regulates branching morphogenesis in the mammary epithelium by modulating the response of the FGFR signalling pathway to FGF stimulation. Considering the importance of branching morphogenesis in multiple taxa, our findings have general importance outside mammary developmental biology.                © 2017.

29623954        	Probing three-dimensional collective cancer invasion with DIGME.            	Multicellular pattern formation plays an important role in developmental biology, cancer metastasis and wound healing. While many physical factors have been shown to regulate these multicellular processes, the role of ECM micro-to-meso scale geometry has been poorly understood in 3D collective cancer invasion.                We have developed a mechanical-based strategy, Diskoid In Geometrically Micropatterned ECM (DIGME). DIGME allows easy engineering of the shape of 3D tissue organoid, the mesoscale ECM heterogeneity, and the fiber alignment of collagen-based ECM all at the same time. We have employed DIGME to study the 3D invasion of MDA-MB-231 diskoids in engineered collagen matrix. We find that the collective cancer invasion is closely regulated by the micro-to-meso scale geometry of the ECM.                We conclude that DIGME provides a simple yet powerful tool to probe 3D dynamics of tissue organoids in physically patterned microenvironments.	
29162437        	Mouse Model of Alagille Syndrome and Mechanisms of Jagged1 Missense Mutations.            	Alagille syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by cholestasis, ocular abnormalities, characteristic facial features, heart defects, and vertebral malformations. Most cases are associated with mutations in JAGGED1 (JAG1), which encodes a Notch ligand, although it is not clear how these contribute to disease development. We aimed to develop a mouse model of Alagille syndrome to elucidate these mechanisms.                Mice with a missense mutation (H268Q) in Jag1 (Jag1+/Ndr mice) were outbred to a C3H/C57bl6 background to generate a mouse model for Alagille syndrome (Jag1Ndr/Ndr mice). Liver tissues were collected at different timepoints during development, analyzed by histology, and liver organoids were cultured and analyzed. We performed transcriptome analysis of Jag1Ndr/Ndr livers and livers from patients with Alagille syndrome, cross-referenced to the Human Protein Atlas, to identify commonly dysregulated pathways and biliary markers. We used species-specific transcriptome separation and ligand-receptor interaction assays to measure Notch signaling and the ability of JAG1Ndr to bind or activate Notch receptors. We studied signaling of JAG1 and JAG1Ndr via NOTCH 1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH3 and resulting gene expression patterns in parental and NOTCH1-expressing C2C12 cell lines.                Jag1Ndr/Ndr mice had many features of Alagille syndrome, including eye, heart, and liver defects. Bile duct differentiation, morphogenesis, and function were dysregulated in newborn Jag1Ndr/Ndr mice, with aberrations in cholangiocyte polarity, but these defects improved in adult mice. Jag1Ndr/Ndr liver organoids collapsed in culture, indicating structural instability. Whole-transcriptome sequence analyses of liver tissues from mice and patients with Alagille syndrome identified dysregulated genes encoding proteins enriched at the apical side of cholangiocytes, including CFTR and SLC5A1, as well as reduced expression of IGF1. Exposure of Notch-expressing cells to JAG1Ndr, compared with JAG1, led to hypomorphic Notch signaling, based on transcriptome analysis. JAG1-expressing cells, but not JAG1Ndr-expressing cells, bound soluble Notch1 extracellular domain, quantified by flow cytometry. However, JAG1 and JAG1Ndr cells each bound NOTCH2, and signaling from NOTCH2 signaling was reduced but not completely inhibited, in response to JAG1Ndr compared with JAG1.                In mice, expression of a missense mutant of Jag1 (Jag1Ndr) disrupts bile duct development and recapitulates Alagille syndrome phenotypes in heart, eye, and craniofacial dysmorphology. JAG1Ndr does not bind NOTCH1, but binds NOTCH2, and elicits hypomorphic signaling. This mouse model can be used to study other features of Alagille syndrome and organ development.

33247498        	Current experimental human tissue-derived models for prostate cancer research.            	Scientists engaged in prostate cancer research have been conducting experiments using two-dimensional cultures of prostate cancer cell lines for decades. However, these experiments fail to reproduce and reflect the clinical course of individual patients with prostate cancer, or the molecular and genetic characteristics of prostate cancer, the basic requirement for most of the preclinical studies on prostate cancer. The use of human prostate cancer tissues in experiments has enabled the collection and verification of clinically relevant data, including chemical reactions, changes in proteins, and specific gene expression. Tissue recombination models have been employed for studying prostate development, the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, and the tumor microenvironment. Notably, the epithelial-stromal interaction, which might play a critical role in prostate cancer pathogenesis, can be reproduced in this model. Patient-derived xenograft models have been developed as powerful avatars comprising patient-derived prostate cancer tissues implanted in immunocompromised mice and could serve as a precision medicine approach for each prostate cancer patient. Spheroid and organoid assays, representative of modern three-dimensional cultures, can replicate the conditions in human prostate tumors and the prostate organ itself as a miniature model. Although an intact immune system against the tumor is missing from the models aimed at investigating immuno-oncological reagents in various malignancies, all these experimental models can help researchers in developing new drugs and selecting appropriate treatment strategies for prostate cancer patients.                © 2020 The Japanese Urological Association.	
27615129        	Three-dimensional pancreas organogenesis models.            	A rediscovery of three-dimensional culture has led to the development of organ biogenesis, homeostasis and disease models applicable to human tissues. The so-called organoids that have recently flourished serve as valuable models bridging between cell lines or primary cells grown on the bottom of culture plates and experiments performed in vivo. Though not recapitulating all aspects of organ physiology, the miniature organs generated in a dish are useful models emerging for the pancreas, starting from embryonic progenitors, adult cells, tumour cells and stem cells. This review focusses on the currently available systems and their relevance to the study of the pancreas, of β-cells and of several pancreatic diseases including diabetes. We discuss the expected future developments for studying human pancreas development and function, for developing diabetes models and for producing therapeutic cells.                © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	
31462542        	Genomics and molecular mechanisms of high grade serous ovarian cancer: the 12th Biennial Rivkin Center Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium.            	The aim of this study was to review current research efforts in genomics and molecular mechanisms of high grade serous ovarian cancer, presented at the 12th Biennial Rivkin Center Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium, held at the University of Washington.                The 12th Biennial Rivkin Center Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium brought together leaders in the field to discuss recent advances in ovarian cancer research and therapy.                The genomics and molecular mechanisms of ovarian cancer session featured invited speaker presentations by Dr Alan D' Andrea on 'Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair in ovarian cancer' and Dr Kathleen Cho on 'Modeling the genomics of high grade serous carcinoma in the mouse'. Eight additional oral presentations and 46 poster presentations were selected from the submitted abstracts that highlighted current research efforts in p53, DNA repair, genomic instability and modeling disease in mice, and organoids in high grade serous ovarian cancer.                New technologies utilizing clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9 (CAS9) approaches in mice, organoids, and cell based screens continue to advance our knowledge of key molecular drivers of ovarian cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Improved understanding of the mechanisms of poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor resistance may lead to new therapeutic strategies to enhance outcomes in women with high grade serous ovarian cancer.                © IGCS and ESGO 2019.

31918229        	Could 3D models of cancer enhance drug screening?            	Cancer is a multifaceted pathology, where cellular and acellular players interact to drive cancer progression and, in the worst-case, metastasis. The current methods to investigate the heterogeneous nature of cancer are inadequate, since they rely on 2D cell cultures and animal models. The cell line-based drug efficacy and toxicity assays are not able to predict the tumor response to anti-cancer agents and it is already widely discussed how molecular pathway are not recapitulated in vitro so called flat biology. On the other side, animal models often fail to detect the side-effects of drugs, mimic the metastatic progression or the interaction between cancer and immune system, due to biologic difference in human and animals. Moreover, ethical and regulatory issues limit animal experimentation. Every year pharma/biotech companies lose resources in drug discovery and testing processes that are successful only in 5% of the cases. There is an urgent need to validate accurate and predictive platforms in order to enhance drug-testing process taking into account the physiopathology of the tumor microenvironment. Three dimensional in vitro tumor models could enhance drug manufactures in developing effective drugs for cancer diseases. The 3D in vitro cancer models can improve the predictability of toxicity and drug sensitivity in cancer. Despite the demonstrated advantages of 3D in vitro disease systems when compared to 2D culture and animal models, they still do not reach the standardization required for preclinical trials. This review highlights in vitro models that may be used as preclinical models, accelerating the drug development process towards more precise and personalized standard of care for cancer patients. We describe the state-of-the art of 3D in vitro culture systems, with a focus on how these different approaches could be coupled in order to achieve a compromise between standardization and reliability in recapitulating tumor microenvironment and drug response.

31304629        	ROCK2 inhibition triggers the collective invasion of colorectal adenocarcinomas.            	The metastatic progression of cancer is a multi-step process initiated by the local invasion of the peritumoral stroma. To identify the mechanisms underlying colorectal carcinoma (CRC) invasion, we collected live human primary cancer specimens at the time of surgery and monitored them ex vivo. This revealed that conventional adenocarcinomas undergo collective invasion while retaining their epithelial glandular architecture with an inward apical pole delineating a luminal cavity. To identify the underlying mechanisms, we used microscopy-based assays on 3D organotypic cultures of Caco-2 cysts as a model system. We performed two siRNA screens targeting Rho-GTPases effectors and guanine nucleotide exchange factors. These screens revealed that ROCK2 inhibition triggers the initial leader/follower polarization of the CRC cell cohorts and induces collective invasion. We further identified FARP2 as the Rac1 GEF necessary for CRC collective invasion. However, FARP2 activation is not sufficient to trigger leader cell formation and the concomitant inhibition of Myosin-II is required to induce invasion downstream of ROCK2 inhibition. Our results contrast with ROCK pro-invasive function in other cancers, stressing that the molecular mechanism of metastatic spread likely depends on tumour types and invasion mode.                © 2019 The Authors.	
31803922        	3D multicellular models to study the regulation and roles of acid-base transporters in breast cancer.            	As a result of elevated metabolic rates and net acid extrusion in the rapidly proliferating cancer cells, solid tumours are characterized by a highly acidic microenvironment, while cancer cell intracellular pH is normal or even alkaline. Two-dimensional (2D) cell monocultures, which have been used extensively in breast cancer research for decades, cannot precisely recapitulate the rich environment and complex processes occurring in tumours in vivo. The use of such models can consequently be misleading or non-predictive for clinical applications. Models mimicking the tumour microenvironment are particularly pivotal for studying tumour pH homeostasis, which is profoundly affected by the diffusion-limited conditions in the tumour. To advance the understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of dysregulated acid-base homeostasis in breast cancer, clinically relevant models that incorporate the unique microenvironment of these tumours are required. The development of three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures has provided new tools for basic research and pre-clinical approaches, allowing the culture of breast cancer cells under conditions that closely resemble tumour growth in a living organism. Here we provide an overview of the main 3D techniques relevant for breast cancer cell culture. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the classical 3D models as well as recent advances in 3D culture techniques, focusing on how these culture methods have been used to study acid-base transport in breast cancer. Finally, we outline future directions of 3D culture technology and their relevance for studies of acid-base transport.                © 2019 The Author(s).

33572297        	Bioinformatic Approaches to Validation and Functional Analysis of 3D Lung Cancer Models.            	3D models of cancer have the potential to improve basic, translational, and clinical studies. Patient-derived xenografts, spheroids, and organoids are broad categories of 3D models of cancer, and to date, these 3D models of cancer have been established for a variety of cancer types. In lung cancer, for example, 3D models offer a promising new avenue to gain novel insights into lung tumor biology and improve outcomes for patients afflicted with the number one cancer killer worldwide. However, the adoption and utility of these 3D models of cancer vary, and demonstrating the fidelity of these models is a critical first step before seeking meaningful applications. Here, we review use cases of current 3D lung cancer models and bioinformatic approaches to assessing model fidelity. Bioinformatics approaches play a key role in both validating 3D lung cancer models and high dimensional functional analyses to support downstream applications.	
31745297        	Chemotherapy impacts on the cellular response to CDK4/6 inhibition: distinct mechanisms of interaction and efficacy in models of pancreatic cancer.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a therapy recalcitrant disease characterized by the aberrations in multiple genes that drive pathogenesis and limit therapeutic response. While CDK4/6 represents a downstream target of both KRAS mutation and loss of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor in PDAC, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibitors are only modestly effective. Since chemotherapy represents the established backbone of PDAC treatment we evaluated the interaction of CDK4/6 inhibitors with gemcitabine and taxanes that are employed in the treatment of PDAC. Herein, we demonstrate that the difference in mechanisms of actions of chemotherapeutic agents elicit distinct effects on the cellular response to CDK4/6 inhibition. Gemcitabine largely ablates the function of CDK4/6 inhibition in S-phase arrested cells when administered contemporaneously; although, when cells recover from S-phase block they exhibit sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of CDK4/6 yields a cooperative cytostatic effect in combination with docetaxel and prevents adaptation and cell cycle re-entry, which is a common basis for resistance to such agents. Importantly, using organoid and PDX models we could confirm the cooperative effects between chemotherapy and CDK4/6 inhibition in vivo. These data indicate that the combination of cytotoxic and cytostatic agents could represent an important modality in those tumor types that are relatively resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors.	
32192771        	Overexpression of CD36 in mammary fibroblasts suppresses colony growth in breast cancer cell lines.            	Human breast tumors are not fully autonomous. They are dependent on nutrients and growth-promoting signals provided by the supporting stromal cells. Within the tumor microenvironment, one of the secreted macromolecules by tumor cells is activin A, where we show to downregulate CD36 in fibroblasts. Downregulation of CD36 in fibroblasts also increases the secretion of activin A by fibroblasts. We hypothesize that overexpression of CD36 in fibroblasts inhibits the formation of solid tumors in subtypes of breast cancer models. For the first time, we show that co-culturing organoid models of breast cancer cell lines of MDA-MB-231 (e.g., a triple-negative line) or MCF7 (e.g., a luminal-A line) with CD36+ fibroblasts inhibit the growth and normalizes basal and lateral polarities, respectively. In the long-term anchorage-independent growth assay, the rate of colony formation is also reduced for MDA-MB-231. These observations are consistent with the mechanism of tumor suppression involving the downregulation of pSMAD2/3 and YY1 expression levels. Our integrated analytical methods leverage and extend quantitative assays at cell- and colony-scales in both short- and long-term cultures using brightfield or immunofluorescent microscopy and robust image analysis. Conditioned media are profiled with the ELISA assay.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
31260412        	N-Myc-mediated epigenetic reprogramming drives lineage plasticity in advanced prostate cancer.            	Despite recent therapeutic advances, prostate cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death. A subset of castration resistant prostate cancers become androgen receptor (AR) signaling-independent and develop neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) features through lineage plasticity. These NEPC tumors, associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis, are driven, in part, by aberrant expression of N-Myc, through mechanisms that remain unclear. Integrative analysis of the N-Myc transcriptome, cistrome and interactome using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo models (including patient-derived organoids) identified a lineage switch towards a neural identity associated with epigenetic reprogramming. N-Myc and known AR-co-factors (e.g., FOXA1 and HOXB13) overlapped, independently of AR, at genomic loci implicated in neural lineage specification. Moreover, histone marks specifically associated with lineage-defining genes were reprogrammed by N-Myc. We also demonstrated that the N-Myc-induced molecular program accurately classifies our cohort of patients with advanced prostate cancer. Finally, we revealed the potential for EZH2 inhibition to reverse the N-Myc-induced suppression of epithelial lineage genes. Altogether, our data provide insights on how N-Myc regulates lineage plasticity and epigenetic reprogramming associated with lineage-specification. The N-Myc signature we defined could also help predict the evolution of prostate cancer and thus better guide the choice of future therapeutic strategies.	
31844249        	Thiazolides promote G1 cell cycle arrest in colorectal cancer cells by targeting the mitochondrial respiratory chain.            	Systemic toxicity and tumor cell resistance still limit the efficacy of chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. Therefore, alternative treatments are desperately needed. The thiazolide Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of parasite-mediated infectious diarrhea with a favorable safety profile. Interestingly, NTZ and the thiazolide RM4819-its bromo-derivative lacking antibiotic activity-are also promising candidates for cancer treatment. Yet the exact anticancer mechanism(s) of these compounds still remains unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated RM4819 and NTZ in 2D and 3D colorectal cancer culture systems. Both compounds strongly inhibited proliferation of colon carcinoma cell lines by promoting G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Thiazolide-induced cell cycle arrest was independent of the p53/p21 axis, but was mediated by inhibition of protein translation via the mTOR/c-Myc/p27 pathway, likely caused by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. While both thiazolides demonstrated mitochondrial uncoupling activity, only RM4819 inhibited the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. Interestingly, thiazolides also potently inhibited the growth of murine colonic tumoroids in a comparable manner with cisplatin, while in contrast to cisplatin thiazolides did not affect the growth of primary intestinal organoids. Thus, thiazolides appear to have a tumor-selective antiproliferative activity, which offers new perspectives in the treatment of colorectal cancer.	
27681436        	Mammary Tumor-Associated RNAs Impact Tumor Cell Proliferation, Invasion, and Migration.            	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent the largest and most diverse class of non-coding RNAs, comprising almost 16,000 currently annotated transcripts in human and 10,000 in mouse. Here, we investigated the role of lncRNAs in mammary tumors by performing RNA-seq on tumor sections and organoids derived from MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-Neu-NDL mice. We identified several hundred lncRNAs that were overexpressed compared to normal mammary epithelium. Among these potentially oncogenic lncRNAs we prioritized a subset as Mammary Tumor Associated RNAs (MaTARs) and determined their human counterparts, hMaTARs. To functionally validate the role of MaTARs, we performed antisense knockdown and observed reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and/or organoid branching in a cancer-specific context. Assessing the expression of hMaTARs in human breast tumors revealed that 19 hMaTARs are significantly upregulated and many of these correlate with breast cancer subtype and/or hormone receptor status, indicating potential clinical relevance.

29285415        	Preclinical Cancer Models and Biomarkers for Drug Development: New Technologies and Emerging Tools.            	Predicting the efficacy of anticancer therapy is the holy grail of drug development and treatment selection in the clinic. To achieve this goal, scientists require pre-clinical models that can reliably screen anticancer agents with robust clinical correlation. However, there is increasing challenge to develop models that can accurately capture the diversity of the tumor ecosystem, and therefore reliably predict how tumors respond or resistant to treatment. Indeed, tumors are made up of a heterogeneous landscape comprising malignant cells, normal and abnormal stroma, immune cells, and dynamic microenvironment containing chemokines, cytokines and growth factors. In this mini-review we present a focused, brief perspective on emerging preclinical models for anticancer therapy that attempt to address the challenge posed by tumor heterogeneity, highlighting biomarkers of response and resistance.                Starting from 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional in-vitro models, we discuss how organoid co-cultures have led to accelerated efforts in anti-cancer drug screening, and advanced our fundamental understanding for mechanisms of action using high-throughput platforms that interrogate various biomarkers of 'clinical' efficacy. Then, mentioning the limitations that exist, we focus on in-vivo and human explant technologies and models, which build-in intrinsic tumor heterogeneity using the native microenvironment as a scaffold. Importantly, we will address how these models can be harnessed to understand cancer immunotherapy, an emerging therapeutic strategy that seeks to recalibrate the body's own immune system to fight cancer.                Over the past several decades, numerous model systems have emerged to address the exploding market of drug development for cancer. While all of the present models have contributed critical information about tumor biology, each one carries limitations. Harnessing pre-clinical models that incorporate cell heterogeneity is beginning to address some of the underlying challenges associated with predicting clinical efficacy of novel anticancer agents.	
30049486        	Patient-derived Models of Abiraterone- and Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Reveal Sensitivity to Ribosome-directed Therapy.            	The intractability of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is exacerbated by tumour heterogeneity, including diverse alterations to the androgen receptor (AR) axis and AR-independent phenotypes. The availability of additional models encompassing this heterogeneity would facilitate the identification of more effective therapies for CRPC.                To discover therapeutic strategies by exploiting patient-derived models that exemplify the heterogeneity of CRPC.                Four new patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were established from independent metastases of two patients and characterised using integrative genomics. A panel of rationally selected drugs was tested using an innovative ex vivo PDX culture system.                The following drugs were evaluated: AR signalling inhibitors (enzalutamide and galeterone), a PARP inhibitor (talazoparib), a chemotherapeutic (cisplatin), a CDK4/6 inhibitor (ribociclib), bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitors (iBET151 and JQ1), and inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis/function (RNA polymerase I inhibitor CX-5461 and pan-PIM kinase inhibitor CX-6258).                Drug efficacy in ex vivo cultures of PDX tissues was evaluated using immunohistochemistry for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Candidate drugs were also tested for antitumour efficacy in vivo, with tumour volume being the primary endpoint. Two-tailed t tests were used to compare drug and control treatments.                Integrative genomics revealed that the new PDXs exhibited heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance, including known and novel AR mutations, genomic structural rearrangements of the AR gene, and a neuroendocrine-like AR-null phenotype. Despite their heterogeneity, all models were sensitive to the combination of ribosome-targeting agents CX-5461 and CX-6258.                This study demonstrates that ribosome-targeting drugs may be effective against diverse CRPC subtypes including AR-null disease, and highlights the potential of contemporary patient-derived models to prioritise treatment strategies for clinical translation.                Diverse types of therapy-resistant prostate cancers are sensitive to a new combination of drugs that inhibit protein synthesis pathways in cancer cells.

26385073        	Pathobiology of Helicobacter pylori-Induced Gastric Cancer.            	Colonization of the human stomach by Helicobacter pylori and its role in causing gastric cancer is one of the richest examples of a complex relationship among human cells, microbes, and their environment. It is also a puzzle of enormous medical importance given the incidence and lethality of gastric cancer worldwide. We review recent findings that have changed how we view these relationships and affected the direction of gastric cancer research. For example, recent data have indicated that subtle mismatches between host and microbe genetic traits greatly affect the risk of gastric cancer. The ability of H pylori and its oncoprotein CagA to reprogram epithelial cells and activate properties of stemness show the sophisticated relationship between H pylori and progenitor cells in the gastric mucosa. The observation that cell-associated H pylori can colonize the gastric glands and directly affect precursor and stem cells supports these observations. The ability to mimic these interactions in human gastric organoid cultures as well as animal models will allow investigators to more fully unravel the extent of H pylori control on the renewing gastric epithelium. Finally, our realization that external environmental factors, such as dietary components and essential micronutrients, as well as the gastrointestinal microbiota, can change the balance between H pylori's activity as a commensal or a pathogen has provided direction to studies aimed at defining the full carcinogenic potential of this organism.

31772170        	Neonatal Wnt-dependent Lgr5 positive stem cells are essential for uterine gland development.            	Wnt signaling is critical for directing epithelial gland development within the uterine lining to ensure successful gestation in adults. Wnt-dependent, Lgr5-expressing stem/progenitor cells are essential for the development of glandular epithelia in the intestine and stomach, but their existence in the developing reproductive tract has not been investigated. Here, we employ Lgr5-2A-EGFP/CreERT2/DTR mouse models to identify Lgr5-expressing cells in the developing uterus and to evaluate their stem cell identity and function. Lgr5 is broadly expressed in the uterine epithelium during embryogenesis, but becomes largely restricted to the tips of developing glands after birth. In-vivo lineage tracing/ablation/organoid culture assays identify these gland-resident Lgr5high cells as Wnt-dependent stem cells responsible for uterine gland development. Adjacent Lgr5neg epithelial cells within the neonatal glands function as essential niche components to support the function of Lgr5high stem cells ex-vivo. These findings constitute a major advance in our understanding of uterine development and lay the foundations for investigating potential contributions of Lgr5+ stem/progenitor cells to uterine disorders.	
31389184        	Senescence-associated tissue microenvironment promotes colon cancer formation through the secretory factor GDF15.            	The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) varies between people, and the cellular mechanisms mediating the differences in risk are largely unknown. Senescence has been implicated as a causative cellular mechanism for many diseases, including cancer, and may affect the risk for CRC. Senescent fibroblasts that accumulate in tissues secondary to aging and oxidative stress have been shown to promote cancer formation via a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In this study, we assessed the role of senescence and the SASP in CRC formation. Using primary human colon tissue, we found an accumulation of senescent fibroblasts in normal tissues from individuals with advanced adenomas or carcinomas in comparison with individuals with no polyps or CRC. In in vitro and ex vivo model systems, we induced senescence using oxidative stress in colon fibroblasts and demonstrated that the senescent fibroblasts secrete GDF15 as an essential SASP factor that promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in colon adenoma and CRC cell lines as well as primary colon organoids via the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. In addition, we observed increased mRNA expression of GDF15 in primary normal colon tissue from people at increased risk for CRC in comparison with average risk individuals. These findings implicate the importance of a senescence-associated tissue microenvironment and the secretory factor GDF15 in promoting CRC formation.                © 2019 The Authors.

28072391        	BRAFV600E cooperates with CDX2 inactivation to promote serrated colorectal tumorigenesis.            	While 20-30% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) may arise from precursors with serrated glands, only 8-10% of CRCs manifest serrated morphology at diagnosis. Markers for distinguishing CRCs arising from 'serrated' versus 'conventional adenoma' precursors are lacking. We studied 36 human serrated CRCs and found CDX2 loss or BRAF mutations in ~60% of cases and often together (p=0.04). CDX2Null/BRAFV600E expression in adult mouse intestinal epithelium led to serrated morphology tumors (including carcinomas) and BRAFV600E potently interacted with CDX2 silencing to alter gene expression. Like human serrated lesions, CDX2Null/BRAFV600E-mutant epithelium expressed gastric markers. Organoids from CDX2Null/BRAFV600E-mutant colon epithelium showed serrated features, and partially recapitulated the gene expression pattern in mouse colon tissues. We present a novel mouse tumor model based on signature defects seen in many human serrated CRCs - CDX2 loss and BRAFV600E. The mouse intestinal tumors show significant phenotypic similarities to human serrated CRCs and inform about serrated CRC pathogenesis.	
30451831        	TBX2 is a neuroblastoma core regulatory circuitry component enhancing MYCN/FOXM1 reactivation of DREAM targets.            	Chromosome 17q gains are almost invariably present in high-risk neuroblastoma cases. Here, we perform an integrative epigenomics search for dosage-sensitive transcription factors on 17q marked by H3K27ac defined super-enhancers and identify TBX2 as top candidate gene. We show that TBX2 is a constituent of the recently established core regulatory circuitry in neuroblastoma with features of a cell identity transcription factor, driving proliferation through activation of p21-DREAM repressed FOXM1 target genes. Combined MYCN/TBX2 knockdown enforces cell growth arrest suggesting that TBX2 enhances MYCN sustained activation of FOXM1 targets. Targeting transcriptional addiction by combined CDK7 and BET bromodomain inhibition shows synergistic effects on cell viability with strong repressive effects on CRC gene expression and p53 pathway response as well as several genes implicated in transcriptional regulation. In conclusion, we provide insight into the role of the TBX2 CRC gene in transcriptional dependency of neuroblastoma cells warranting clinical trials using BET and CDK7 inhibitors.	
33403789        	Rab11-FIP1 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion in esophageal cancer.            	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common subtype of esophageal cancer worldwide. The most commonly mutated gene in ESCC is TP53. Using a combinatorial genetic and carcinogenic approach, we generate a novel mouse model of ESCC expressing either mutant or null p53 and show that mutant p53 exhibits enhanced tumorigenic properties and displays a distinct genomic profile. Through RNA-seq analysis, we identify several endocytic recycling genes, including Rab Coupling Protein (Rab11-FIP1), which are significantly downregulated in mutant p53 tumor cells. In 3-dimensional (3D) organoid models, genetic knockdown of Rab11-FIP1 results in increased organoid size. Loss of Rab11-FIP1 increases tumor cell invasion in part through mutant p53 but also in an independent manner. Furthermore, loss of Rab11-FIP1 in human ESCC cell lines decreases E-cadherin expression and increases mesenchymal lineage-specific markers, suggesting induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Rab11-FIP1 regulates EMT through direct inhibition of Zeb1, a key EMT transcriptional factor. Our novel findings reveal that Rab11-FIP1 regulates organoid formation, tumor cell invasion, and EMT.                © 2020 The Authors.

30647844        	Hedgehog signaling induces PD-L1 expression and tumor cell proliferation in gastric cancer.            	Tumor cells expressing programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) interact with PD-1 on CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to inhibit CTL effector function. In gastric cancer, the mechanism regulating PD-L1 is unclear. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is reactivated in various cancers including gastric. Here we tested the hypothesis that Hh-induced PD-L1 inactivates effector T cell function and allows gastric cancer cell proliferation. Mouse organoids were generated from tumors of a triple-transgenic mouse model engineered to express an activated GLI2 allele, GLI2A, in Lgr5-expressing stem cells, (mTGOs) or normal mouse stomachs (mGOs). Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were pulsed with conditioned media collected from normal (mGOCM) or cancer (mTGOCM) organoids. Pulsed DCs and CTLs were then co-cultured with either mGOs or mTGOs in the presence of PD-L1 neutralizing antibody (PD-L1Ab). Human-derived gastric cancer organoids (huTGOs) were used in drug and xenograft assays. Hh/Gli inhibitor, GANT-61 significantly reduced the expression of PD-L1 and tumor cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. PD-L1Ab treatment induced tumor cell apoptosis in mTGO/immune cell co-cultures. GANT-61 treatment sensitized huTGOs to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, Hh signaling mediates PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer cells and subsequently promotes tumor proliferation.	
30679179        	IDO1 and Kynurenine Pathway Metabolites Activate PI3K-Akt Signaling in the Neoplastic Colon Epithelium to Promote Cancer Cell Proliferation and Inhibit Apoptosis.            	The tryptophan-metabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is frequently overexpressed in epithelial-derived malignancies, where it plays a recognized role in promoting tumor immune tolerance. We previously demonstrated that the IDO1-kynurenine pathway (KP) also directly supports colorectal cancer growth by promoting activation of β-catenin and driving neoplastic growth in mice lacking intact adaptive immunity. In this study, we sought to delineate the specific role of epithelial IDO1 in colon tumorigenesis and define how IDO1 and KP metabolites interact with pivotal neoplastic signaling pathways of the colon epithelium. We generated a novel intestinal epithelial-specific IDO1 knockout mouse and utilized established colorectal cancer cell lines containing β-catenin-stabilizing mutations, human colorectal cancer samples, and human-derived epithelial organoids (colonoids and tumoroids). Mice with intestinal epithelial-specific knockout of IDO1 developed fewer and smaller tumors than wild-type littermates in a model of inflammation-driven colon tumorigenesis. Moreover, their tumors exhibited reduced nuclear β-catenin and neoplastic proliferation but increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, KP metabolites (except kynurenic acid) rapidly activated PI3K-Akt signaling in the neoplastic epithelium to promote nuclear translocation of β-catenin, cellular proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. Together, these data define a novel cell-autonomous function and mechanism by which IDO1 activity promotes colorectal cancer progression. These findings may have implications for the rational design of new clinical trials that exploit a synergy of IDO1 inhibitors with conventional cancer therapies for which Akt activation provides resistance such as radiation.Significance: This study identifies a new mechanistic link between IDO1 activity and PI3K/AKT signaling, both of which are important pathways involved in cancer growth and resistance to cancer therapy.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32504051        	Pre-clinical modeling of cutaneous melanoma.            	Metastatic melanoma is challenging to manage. Although targeted- and immune therapies have extended survival, most patients experience therapy resistance. The adaptability of melanoma cells in nutrient- and therapeutically-challenged environments distinguishes melanoma as an ideal model for investigating therapy resistance. In this review, we discuss the current available repertoire of melanoma models including two- and three-dimensional tissue cultures, organoids, genetically engineered mice and patient-derived xenograft. In particular, we highlight how each system recapitulates different features of melanoma adaptability and can be used to better understand melanoma development, progression and therapy resistance.	
32122905        	A New Assay to Measure Intestinal Crypt Survival after Irradiation: Challenges and Opportunities.            	Radiotherapy is a critical component of many current, curative cancer treatments, yet it is accompanied by unavoidable irradiation of normal tissues. Abdominal and pelvic radiation almost always results in some dose delivered to the bowel with deleterious effects to the small and large intestines. While the likelihood of enteritis is dose dependent, there is also considerable variation between patients in both the extent of symptoms of enteritis as well as their duration. In this article, Martin and colleagues hypothesized that the radiation sensitivity of intestinal organoids could predict the sensitivity of individual patients to enteritis and have taken the first steps to develop such an assay.See related article by Martin et al., p. 1219.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
26751771        	CFTR is a tumor suppressor gene in murine and human intestinal cancer.            	CFTR, the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene, encodes for the CFTR protein that plays an essential role in anion regulation and tissue homeostasis of various epithelia. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract CFTR promotes chloride and bicarbonate secretion, playing an essential role in ion and acid-base homeostasis. Cftr has been identified as a candidate driver gene for colorectal cancer (CRC) in several Sleeping Beauty DNA transposon-based forward genetic screens in mice. Further, recent epidemiological and clinical studies indicate that CF patients are at high risk for developing tumors in the colon. To investigate the effects of CFTR dysregulation on GI cancer, we generated Apc(Min) mice that carried an intestinal-specific knockout of Cftr. Our results indicate that Cftr is a tumor suppressor gene in the intestinal tract as Cftr mutant mice developed significantly more tumors in the colon and the entire small intestine. In Apc(+/+) mice aged to ~1 year, Cftr deficiency alone caused the development of intestinal tumors in >60% of mice. Colon organoid formation was significantly increased in organoids created from Cftr mutant mice compared with wild-type controls, suggesting a potential role of Cftr in regulating the intestinal stem cell compartment. Microarray data from the Cftr-deficient colon and the small intestine identified dysregulated genes that belong to groups of immune response, ion channel, intestinal stem cell and other growth signaling regulators. These associated clusters of genes were confirmed by pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We also conducted RNA Seq analysis of tumors from Apc(+/+) Cftr knockout mice and identified sets of genes dysregulated in tumors including altered Wnt β-catenin target genes. Finally we analyzed expression of CFTR in early stage human CRC patients stratified by risk of recurrence and found that loss of expression of CFTR was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival.	
29100379        	Gambogic acid inhibits thioredoxin activity and induces ROS-mediated cell death in castration-resistant prostate cancer.            	Advanced prostate cancer (PrCa) is treated with androgen deprivation therapy, and although there is usually a significant initial response, recurrence arises as castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). New approaches are needed to treat this genetically heterogeneous, phenotypically plastic disease. CRPC with combined homozygous alterations to PTEN and TP53 comprise about 30% of clinical samples. We screened eleven traditional Chinese medicines against a panel of androgen-independent Pten/Tp53 null PrCa-derived cell lines and identified gambogic acid (GA) as a highly potent growth inhibitor. Mechanistic analyses revealed that GA disrupted cellular redox homeostasis, observed as elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to apoptotic and ferroptotic death. Consistent with this, we determined that GA inhibited thioredoxin, a necessary component of cellular anti-oxidative, protein-reducing activity. In other clinically relevant models, GA displayed submicromolar, growth inhibitory activity against a number of genomically-representative, CRPC patient derived xenograft organoid cultures. Inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-cysteine partially reversed growth inhibition in CRPC organoids, demonstrating ROS imbalance and implying that GA may have additional mechanisms of action. These data suggest that redox imbalances initiated by GA may be useful, especially in combination therapies, for treating the heterogeneity and plasticity that contributes to the therapeutic resistance of CRPC.

29248454        	Acquisition of Cholangiocarcinoma Traits during Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Development in Mice.            	Past studies have identified hepatic tumors with mixed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) characteristics that have a more aggressive behavior and a poorer prognosis than classic HCC. Whether this pathologic heterogeneity is due to a cell of origin of bipotent liver progenitors or the plasticity of cellular constituents comprising these tumors remains debated. In this study, we investigated the potential acquisition of CC-like traits during advanced development of HCC in mice. Primary and rare high-grade HCC developed in a genetic mouse model. A mouse model of highly efficient HCC invasion and metastasis by orthotopic transplantation of liver cancer organoids propagated from primary tumors in the genetic model was further developed. Invasive/metastatic tumors developed in both models closely recapitulated advanced human HCC and displayed a striking acquisition of CC-related pathologic and molecular features, which was absent in the primary HCC tumors. Our study directly demonstrates the pathologic evolution of HCC during advanced tumor development, providing the first evidence that tumors with mixed HCC and CC features, or at least a subset of these tumors, represent a more advanced developmental stage of HCC. Finally, liver cancer organoid-generated high-grade tumors exhibited significantly increased extracellular vesicle secretion, suggesting that identifying tumor-specific extracellular vesicle proteins in plasma may be a promising tool for liver cancer detection.

32127391        	Interferon-Induced IDO1 Mediates Radiation Resistance and Is a Therapeutic Target in Colorectal Cancer.            	Colorectal cancer is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Chemotherapy and radiation remain standard treatment for locally advanced disease, with current immune-targeting therapies applying to only a small subset of patients. Expression of the immuno-oncology target indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is associated with poor colorectal cancer clinical outcomes but is understudied as a potential treatment target. In this study, we examined the interaction between the IDO1 pathway and radiotherapy in colorectal cancer. We used human and mouse colorectal cancer cell lines, organoids, mouse syngeneic colorectal cancer tumor graft models, and colorectal cancer tissues from patients who received radiotherapy. IDO1 activity was blocked using the clinical IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat and by genetic disruption. We found that radiation induced IDO1 overexpression in colorectal cancer through type I and II IFN signaling. IDO1 enzymatic activity directly influenced colorectal cancer radiation sensitivity. IDO1 inhibition sensitized colorectal cancer to radiation-induced cell death, whereas the IDO1 metabolite kynurenine promoted radioprotection. IDO1 inhibition also potentiated Th1 cytokines and myeloid cell-modulating factors in the tumor microenvironment and promoted an abscopal effect on tumors outside the radiation field. Conversely, IDO1 blockade protected the normal small intestinal epithelium from radiation toxicity and accelerated recovery from radiation-induced weight loss, indicating a role in limiting side effects. These data demonstrated that IDO1 inhibition potentiates radiotherapy effectiveness in colorectal cancer. The findings also provide rationale and mechanistic insight for the study of IDO1 inhibitors as adjuvant therapy to radiation in patients with locally advanced sporadic and colitis-associated colorectal cancer.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

33318650        	Human mini-brain models.            	Engineered human mini-brains, made possible by knowledge from the convergence of precision microengineering and cell biology, permit systematic studies of complex neurological processes and of pathogenesis beyond what can be done with animal models. By culturing human brain cells with physiological microenvironmental cues, human mini-brain models reconstitute the arrangement of structural tissues and some of the complex biological functions of the human brain. In this Review, we highlight the most significant developments that have led to microphysiological human mini-brain models. We introduce the history of mini-brain development, review methods for creating mini-brain models in static conditions, and discuss relevant state-of-the-art dynamic cell-culture systems. We also review human mini-brain models that reconstruct aspects of major neurological disorders under static or dynamic conditions. Engineered human mini-brains will contribute to advancing the study of the physiology and aetiology of neurological disorders, and to the development of personalized medicines for them.

28705002        	Preclinical models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.            	Unlike many other cancers, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has seen only incremental improvement in mortality despite significant advances in our understanding of the underlying biology. A primary obstacle to progress has been our inability to properly model PDAC in a preclinical setting. PDAC is difficult to study because of its genetic heterogeneity, intricate stromal microenvironment, and complex interplay with our immune system. Finding a model that properly accounts for all these criteria remains difficult. This review summarizes the five primary models currently in use: human PDAC cell line, cell line xenograft, patient derived xenograft, genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), and organoids. We delve into the advantages of disadvantages of each model, while discussing how each model has been or could be used in the preclinical setting.	
31319641        	Pancreatic High-Grade Neuroendocrine Neoplasms in the Korean Population: A Multicenter Study.            	The most recent 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) has refined the three-tiered 2010 scheme by separating grade 3 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (G3 PanNETs) from poorly differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (PanNECs). However, differentiating between G3 Pan- NETs and PanNECs is difficult in clinical practice.                Eighty-two surgically resected PanNENs were collected from 16 institutions and reclassified according to the 2017 WHO classification based on the histological features and proliferation index (mitosis and Ki-67). Immunohistochemical stains for ATRX, DAXX, retinoblastoma, p53, Smad4, p16, and MUC1 were performed for 15 high-grade PanNENs.                Re-classification resulted in 20 G1 PanNETs (24%), 47 G2 PanNETs (57%), eight G3 well-differentiated PanNETs (10%), and seven poorly differentiated PanNECs (9%). PanNECs showed more frequent diffuse nuclear atypia, solid growth patterns and apoptosis, less frequent organoid growth and regular vascular patterns, and absence of low-grade PanNET components than PanNETs. The Ki-67 index was significantly higher in PanNEC (58.2%± 15.1%) compared to G3 PanNET (22.6%±6.1%, p < 0.001). Abnormal expression of any two of p53, p16, MUC1, and Smad4 could discriminate PanNECs from G3 PanNETs with 100% specificity and 87.5% sensitivity.                Histological features supporting the diagnosis of PanNECs over G3 PanNETs were the absence of a low-grade PanNET component in the tumor, the presence of diffuse marked nuclear atypia, solid growth pattern, frequent apoptosis and markedly increased proliferative activity with homogeneous Ki-67 labeling. Immunohistochemical stains for p53, p16, MUC1, and Smad4 may be helpful in distinguishing PanNECs from G3 PanNETs in histologically ambiguous cases, especially in diagnostic practice when only small biopsied tissues are available.	
31894140        	Patient-derived explants (PDEs) as a powerful preclinical platform for anti-cancer drug and biomarker discovery.            	Preclinical models that can accurately predict outcomes in the clinic are much sought after in the field of cancer drug discovery and development. Existing models such as organoids and patient-derived xenografts have many advantages, but they suffer from the drawback of not contextually preserving human tumour architecture. This is a particular problem for the preclinical testing of immunotherapies, as these agents require an intact tumour human-specific microenvironment for them to be effective. In this review, we explore the potential of patient-derived explants (PDEs) for fulfilling this need. PDEs involve the ex vivo culture of fragments of freshly resected human tumours that retain the histological features of original tumours. PDE methodology for anti-cancer drug testing has been in existence for many years, but the platform has not been widely adopted in translational research facilities, despite strong evidence for its clinical predictivity. By modifying PDE endpoint analysis to include the spatial profiling of key biomarkers by using multispectral imaging, we argue that PDEs offer many advantages, including the ability to correlate drug responses with tumour pathology, tumour heterogeneity and changes in the tumour microenvironment. As such, PDEs are a powerful model of choice for cancer drug and biomarker discovery programmes.	
32905405        	Cell swelling, softening and invasion in a three-dimensional breast cancer model.            	Sculpting of structure and function of three-dimensional multicellular tissues depend critically on the spatial and temporal coordination of cellular physical properties, yet the organizational principles that govern these events, and their disruption in disease, remain poorly understood. Using a multicellular mammary cancer organoid model, here we map in three dimensions the spatial and temporal evolution of positions, motions, and physical characteristics of individual cells. Compared with cells in the organoid core, cells at the organoid periphery and the invasive front are found to be systematically softer, larger and more dynamic. These mechanical changes are shown to arise from supracellular fluid flow through gap junctions, suppression of which delays transition to an invasive phenotype. Together, these findings highlight the role of spatiotemporal coordination of cellular physical properties in tissue organization and disease progression.	
32919034        	The not-so-sweet side of sugar: Influence of the microenvironment on the processes that unleash cancer.            	The role of "aerobic glycolysis" in cancer has been examined often in the past. Results from those studies, most of which were performed on two dimensional conditions (2D, tissue culture plastic), demonstrate that aerobic glycolysis occurs as a consequence of oncogenic events. These oncogenic events often drive malignant cell growth and survival. Although 2D based experiments are useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis, they fail to take contributions of the extracellular microenvironment into account. Indeed we, and others, have shown that the cellular microenvironment is essential in regulating processes that induce and/or suppress the malignant phenotype/properties. This regulation between the cell and its microenvironment is both dynamic and reciprocal and involves the integration of cellular signaling networks in the right context. Therefore, given our previous demonstration of the effect of the microenvironment including tissue architecture and media composition on gene expression and the integration of signaling events observed in three-dimension (3D), we hypothesized that glucose uptake and metabolism must also be essential components of the tissue's signal "integration plan" - that is, if uptake and metabolism of glucose were hyperactivated, the canonical oncogenic pathways should also be similarly activated. This hypothesis, if proven true, suggests that direct inhibition of glucose metabolism in cancer cells should either suppress or revert the malignant phenotype in 3D. Here, we review the up-to-date progress that has been made towards understanding the role that glucose metabolism plays in oncogenesis and re-establishing basally polarized acini in malignant human breast cells.

31798775        	New era for pancreatic endoscopic ultrasound: From imaging to molecular pathology of pancreatic cancer.            	With recent advances in molecular pathology and the development of new chemotherapy regimens, the knowledge of the molecular alterations of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is becoming appealing for stratifying patients for prognosis and response to a defined treatment. Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples are a useful source of genomic deoxyribonucleic acid; nevertheless, most studies employed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples deriving from surgical specimens, which are therefore representative of <20% of PDAC patients. Indeed, the development of a reliable methodology for endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition, stabilization, and analysis is crucial for the development of molecular markers for clinical use in order to achieve "personalized medicine". With the development of new needles, this technique is able to retrieve a high quantity and quality of PDAC tissue that can be used not only for diagnosis but also for mutational and transcriptome evaluations and for the development of primary cell or tissue cultures. In the present editorial, we discuss the current knowledge regarding the use of endoscopic ultrasound as a tool to obtain samples for molecular analyses, its possible pitfalls, and its use for the development of disease models such as xenografts or organoids.                ©The Author(s) 2019.

32128067        	Bioinformatics and computational approaches for analyzing patient-derived disease models in cancer research.            	Patient-derived organoids (PDO) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) continue to emerge as important preclinical platforms for investigations into the molecular landscape of cancer. While the advantages and disadvantage of these models have been described in detail, this review focuses in particular on the bioinformatics and state-of-the art techniques that accompany preclinical model development. We discuss the strength and limitations of currently used technologies, particularly 'omics profiling and bioinformatics analyses, in addressing the 'efficacy' of preclinical models, both for tumour characterization as well as their use in identifying potential therapeutics. We select pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as a case study to highlight the state of the art of the field, and address new avenues for improved bioinformatics characterization of preclinical models.                © 2020 The Author.	
31848340        	LATS1 but not LATS2 represses autophagy by a kinase-independent scaffold function.            	Autophagy perturbation represents an emerging therapeutic strategy in cancer. Although LATS1 and LATS2 kinases, core components of the mammalian Hippo pathway, have been shown to exert tumor suppressive activities, here we report a pro-survival role of LATS1 but not LATS2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Specifically, LATS1 restricts lethal autophagy in HCC cells induced by sorafenib, the standard of care for advanced HCC patients. Notably, autophagy regulation by LATS1 is independent of its kinase activity. Instead, LATS1 stabilizes the autophagy core-machinery component Beclin-1 by promoting K27-linked ubiquitination at lysine residues K32 and K263 on Beclin-1. Consequently, ubiquitination of Beclin-1 negatively regulates autophagy by promoting inactive dimer formation of Beclin-1. Our study highlights a functional diversity between LATS1 and LATS2, and uncovers a scaffolding role of LATS1 in mediating a cross-talk between the Hippo signaling pathway and autophagy.	
32816913        	Slow-Cycling Cancer Stem Cells Regulate Progression and Chemoresistance in Colon Cancer.            	Cancer chemoresistance is often attributed to the presence of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells, but whether they are homogeneously chemoresistant remains unclear. We previously showed that in colon tumors, a subpopulation of LGR5+ CSC-like cells driven by TCF1 (TCF7), a Wnt-responsive transcription factor, were responsible for tumorigenicity. Here we demonstrate that the tumorigenic subpopulation of mouse LGR5+ cells exists in a slow-cycling state and identify a unique 22-gene signature that characterizes these slow-cycling CSC. Seven of the signature genes are specifically expressed in slow-cycling LGR5+ cells from xenografted human colon tumors and are upregulated in colon cancer clinical specimens. Among these seven, four genes (APCDD1, NOTUM, PROX1, and SP5) are known to be direct Wnt target genes, and PROX1 was expressed in the invasive fronts of colon tumors. PROX1 was activated by TCF1 to induce CDKN1C and maintain a slow-cycling state in colon cancer organoids. Strikingly, PROX1 was required for recurrent growth after chemotherapeutic treatment, suggesting that inhibition of slow-cycling CSC by targeting the TCF1-PROX1-CDKN1C pathway is an effective strategy to combat refractory colon cancer in combination with conventional chemotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings illustrate the importance of a slow-cycling CSC subpopulation in colon cancer development and chemoresistance, with potential implications for the identified slow-cycling CSC signatures and the TCF1-PROX1-CDKN1C pathway as therapeutic targets.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31804471        	Heterogeneity and dynamics of active Kras-induced dysplastic lineages from mouse corpus stomach.            	Dysplasia is considered a key transition state between pre-cancer and cancer in gastric carcinogenesis. However, the cellular or phenotypic heterogeneity and mechanisms of dysplasia progression have not been elucidated. We have established metaplastic and dysplastic organoid lines, derived from Mist1-Kras(G12D) mouse stomach corpus and studied distinct cellular behaviors and characteristics of metaplastic and dysplastic organoids. We also examined functional roles for Kras activation in dysplasia progression using Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, which is a downstream mediator of Kras signaling. Here, we report that dysplastic organoids die or show altered cellular behaviors and diminished aggressive behavior in response to MEK inhibition. However, the organoids surviving after MEK inhibition maintain cellular heterogeneity. Two dysplastic stem cell (DSC) populations are also identified in dysplastic cells, which exhibited different clonogenic potentials. Therefore, Kras activation controls cellular dynamics and progression to dysplasia, and DSCs might contribute to cellular heterogeneity in dysplastic cell lineages.	
31882967        	Hydrodynamic stress stimulates growth of cell clusters via the ANXA1/PI3K/AKT axis in colorectal cancer.            	Cancer cells are exposed to various stresses in vivo, including hydrodynamic stress (HDS). HDS on cancer cells in the blood stream can influence the metastatic potential. Recent studies revealed that circulating tumor cell clusters are more responsible for metastasis than circulating single cells. Nevertheless, most studies on HDS are based on single cells prepared from established cancer cell lines. Here, we used cancer tissue-originated spheroids (CTOS) as a patient-derived, 3D organoid model to investigate the effect of HDS on cancer cell clusters. We found that HDS induced the growth of cancer cell clusters in a population of colorectal CTOSs. Microarray analyses revealed that the multifunctional protein, Annexin 1 (ANXA1), was upregulated upon HDS exposure. Chemically-induced membrane damage also triggered the expression of ANXA1. A knockdown of ANXA1 revealed that ANXA1 regulated HDS-stimulated growth in colorectal CTOSs. Mechanistically, activating the PI3K/AKT pathway downstream of ANXA1 contributed to the phenotype. These findings demonstrate that HDS induces the growth of cancer cell clusters via ANXA1/PI3K/AKT axis, which helps to elucidate the pro-metastatic feature of circulating cancer cell clusters.	
27670082        	Identification of Stem Cells in the Epithelium of the Stomach Corpus and Antrum of Mice.            	Little is known about the mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis, partly because it has been a challenge to identify characterize gastric stem cells. Runx genes regulate development and their products are transcription factors associated with cancer development. A Runx1 enhancer element, eR1, is a marker of hematopoietic stem cells. We studied expression from eR1 in the stomach and the roles of gastric stem cells in gastric carcinogenesis in transgenic mice.                We used in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analyses to study expression of Runx1 in gastric tissues from C57BL/6 (control) mice. We then created mice that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or CreERT2 under the control of eR1 (eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-Lox-Stop-Lox [LSL]-tdTomato, eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-LSL-EYFP mice). Gastric tissues were collected and lineage-tracing experiments were performed. Gastric organoids were cultured from eR1-CreERT2(5-2);Rosa-LSL-tdTomato mice and immunofluorescence analyses were performed. We investigated the effects of expressing oncogenic mutations in stem cells under control of eR1 using eR1-CreERT2;LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice; gastric tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence.                Most proliferation occurred in the isthmus; 86% of proliferating cells were RUNX1-positive and 76% were MUC5AC-positive. In eR1-EGFP mice, EGFP signals were detected mainly in the upper part of the gastric unit, and 83% of EGFP-positive cells were located in the isthmus/pit region. We found that eR1 marked undifferentiated stem cells in the isthmus and a smaller number of terminally differentiated chief cells at the base. eR1 also marked cells in the pyloric gland in the antrum. Lineage-tracing experiments demonstrated that stem cells in the isthmus and antrum continuously gave rise to mature cells to maintain the gastric unit. eR1-positive cells in the isthmus and pyloric gland generated organoid cultures in vitro. In eR1-CreERT2;LSL-Kras G12D/+ mice, MUC5AC-positive cells rapidly differentiated from stem cells in the isthmus, resulting in distinct metaplastic lesions similar to that observed in human gastric atrophy.                Using lineage-tracing experiments in mice, we found that a Runx1 enhancer element, eR1, promotes its expression in the isthmus stem cells of stomach corpus as well as pyloric gland in the antrum. We were able to use eR1 to express oncogenic mutations in gastric stem cells, proving a new model for studies of gastric carcinogenesis.                Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

32427938        	SH3RF3 promotes breast cancer stem-like properties via JNK activation and PTX3 upregulation.            	Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are the tumorigenic cell subpopulation and contribute to cancer recurrence and metastasis. However, the understanding of CSC regulatory mechanisms remains incomplete. By transcriptomic analysis, we identify a scaffold protein SH3RF3 (also named POSH2) that is upregulated in CSCs of breast cancer clinical tumors and cancer cell lines, and enhances the CSC properties of breast cancer cells. Mechanically, SH3RF3 interacts with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in a JNK-interacting protein (JIP)-dependent manner, leading to enhanced phosphorylation of JNK and activation of the JNK-JUN pathway. Further the JNK-JUN signaling expands CSC subpopulation by transcriptionally activating the expression of Pentraxin 3 (PTX3). The functional role of SH3RF3 in CSCs is validated with patient-derived organoid culture, and supported by clinical cohort analyses. In conclusion, our work elucidates the role and molecular mechanism of SH3RF3 in CSCs of breast cancer, and might provide opportunities for CSC-targeting therapy.	
27941880        	Different in vivo and in vitro transformation of intestinal stem cells in mismatch repair deficiency.            	Mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes result in microsatellite instability (MSI) and early onset of colorectal cancer. To get mechanistic insights into the time scale, sequence and frequency of intestinal stem cell (ISC) transformation, we quantified MSI and growth characteristics of organoids of Msh2-deficient and control mice from birth until tumor formation and related them to tissue gene expression. Although in Msh2-deficient organoids MSI continuously increased from birth, growth characteristics remained stable at first. Months before tumor onset, normal Msh2-deficient tissue contained tumor precursor cells forming organoids with higher MSI, cystic growth and growth rates resembling temporarily those of tumor organoids. Consistently, Msh2-deficient tissue exhibited a tumor-like gene signature. Normal Msh2-deficient organoids showed increased inheritable transient cyst-like growth, which became independent of R-spondin. ISC transformation proceeded faster in vitro than in vivo independent of the underlying genotype but more under MMR deficiency. Transient cyst-like growth but not MSI was suppressed by aspirin. In summary, as highlighted by organoids, molecular alterations continuously proceeded long before tumor onset in MMR-deficient intestine, thus increasing its susceptibility for ISC transformation.	
28533437        	Metformin Inhibits Cellular Proliferation and Bioenergetics in Colorectal Cancer Patient-Derived Xenografts.            	There is increasing preclinical evidence suggesting that metformin, an antidiabetic drug, has anticancer properties against various malignancies, including colorectal cancer. However, the majority of evidence, which was derived from cancer cell lines and xenografts, was likely to overestimate the benefit of metformin because these models are inadequate and require supraphysiologic levels of metformin. Here, we generated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines from 2 colorectal cancer patients to assess the properties of metformin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the first-line drug treatment for colorectal cancer. Metformin (150 mg/kg) as a single agent inhibits the growth of both PDX tumors by at least 50% (P < 0.05) when administered orally for 24 days. In one of the PDX models, metformin given concurrently with 5-FU (25 mg/kg) leads to an 85% (P = 0.054) growth inhibition. Ex vivo culture of organoids generated from PDX demonstrates that metformin inhibits growth by executing metabolic changes to decrease oxygen consumption and activating AMPK-mediated pathways. In addition, we also performed genetic characterizations of serial PDX samples with corresponding parental tissues from patients using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our pilot NGS study demonstrates that PDX represents a useful platform for analysis in cancer research because it demonstrates high fidelity with parental tumor. Furthermore, NGS analysis of PDX may be useful to determine genetic identifiers of drug response. This is the first preclinical study using PDX and PDX-derived organoids to investigate the efficacy of metformin in colorectal cancer.

30717751        	Circular RNA circNRIP1 acts as a microRNA-149-5p sponge to promote gastric cancer progression via the AKT1/mTOR pathway.            	CircRNA has emerged as a new non-coding RNA that plays crucial roles in tumour initiation and development. 'MiRNA sponge' is the most reported role played by circRNAs in many tumours. The AKT/mTOR axis is a classic signalling pathway in cancers that sustains energy homeostasis through energy production activities, such as the Warburg effect, and blocks catabolic activities, such as autophagy. Additionally, the AKT/mTOR axis exerts a positive effect on EMT, which promotes tumour metastasis.                We detected higher circNRIP1 expression in gastric cancer by performing RNA-seq analysis. We verified the tumour promotor role of circNRIP1 in gastric cancer cells through a series of biological function assays. We then used a pull-down assay and dual-luciferase reporter assay to identify the downstream miR-149-5p of circNRIP1. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assays were performed to demonstrate that the circNRIP1-miR-149-5p-AKT1/mTOR axis is responsible for the altered metabolism in GC cells and promotes GC development. We then adopted a co-culture system to trace circNRIP1 transmission via exosomal communication and RIP experiments to determine that quaking regulates circNRIP1 expression. Finally, we confirmed the tumour suppressor role of microRNA-133a-3p in vivo in PDX mouse models.                We discovered that knockdown of circNRIP1 successfully blocked proliferation, migration, invasion and the expression level of AKT1 in GC cells. MiR-149-5p inhibition phenocopied the overexpression of circNRIP1 in GC cells, and overexpression of miR-149-5p blocked the malignant behaviours of circNRIP1. Moreover, it was proven that circNRIP1 can be transmitted by exosomal communication between GC cells, and exosomal circNRIP1 promoted tumour metastasis in vivo. We also demonstrated that quaking can promote circNRIP1 transcription. In the final step, the tumour promotor role of circNRIP1 was verified in PDX models.                We proved that circNRIP1 sponges miR-149-5p to affect the expression level of AKT1 and eventually acts as a tumour promotor in GC.	
28143999        	3D hydrogel-based microwell arrays as a tumor microenvironment model to study breast cancer growth.            	The tumor microenvironment (TME) is distinctly heterogeneous and is involved in tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. Mimicking this diverse microenvironment is essential for understanding tumor growth and metastasis. Despite the substantial scientific progress made with traditional cell culture methods, microfabricated three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures that can be precisely controlled to mimic the changes occur in the TME over tumor progression are necessary for simulating organ-specific TME in vitro. In this research, to simulate the breast cancer TME, microwell arrays of defined geometry and dimensions were fabricated using photo-reactive hydrogels for a cancer cell line and primary explant tissue culture. Microwell arrays fabricated from 4-arm polyethylene glycol acrylate and methacrylated gelatin with different degrees of methacrylation for controlled cell-matrix interactions and tunable stiffness were used to create a platform for studying the effects of distinct hydrogel compositions and stiffness on tumor formation. Using these microwell arrays, size-controlled spheroids of human breast cancer cell line HCC1806 were formed and the cell attachment properties, viability, metabolic activity, and migration levels of these spheroids were examined. In addition, primary mammary organoid tissues explanted from mice were successfully cultured in these hydrogel-based microwell arrays and the organoid morphology and viability, as well as organoid branching were studied. The microwell array platform developed and characterized in this study could be useful for generating a tissue-specific TME for in vitro high throughput studies of breast cancer development and progression as well as in drug screening studies for breast cancer treatment.	
31831554        	A Subset of Colorectal Cancers with Cross-Sensitivity to Olaparib and Oxaliplatin.            	Defects in the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway are of clinical interest due to sensitivity of HR-deficient cells to PARP inhibitors. We were interested in defining PARP vulnerability in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) carrying KRAS and BRAF mutations who display poor prognosis, have limited therapeutic options, and represent an unmet clinical need.                We tested colorectal cancer cell lines, patient-derived organoids (PDO), and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) enriched for KRAS and BRAF mutations for sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, and the chemotherapeutic agents oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Genomic profiles and DNA repair proficiency of colorectal cancer models were compared with pharmacologic response.                Thirteen of 99 (around 13%) colorectal cancer cell lines were highly sensitive to clinically active concentrations of olaparib and displayed functional deficiency in HR. Response to PARP blockade was positively correlated with sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer cell lines as well as patient-derived organoids. Treatment of PDXs with olaparib impaired tumor growth and maintenance therapy with PARP blockade after initial oxaliplatin response delayed disease progression in mice.                These results indicate that a colorectal cancer subset characterized by poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options is vulnerable to PARP inhibition and suggest that PDO-based drug-screening assays can be used to identify patients with colorectal cancer likely to benefit from olaparib. As patients with mCRC almost invariably receive therapies based on oxaliplatin, "maintenance" treatment with PARP inhibitors warrants further clinical investigation.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
33172975        	Breast Tumor Kinase (Brk/PTK6) Mediates Advanced Cancer Phenotypes via SH2-Domain Dependent Activation of RhoA and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) Signaling.            	Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6; also called Brk) is overexpressed in 86% of patients with breast cancer; high PTK6 expression predicts poor outcome. We reported PTK6 induction by HIF/GR complexes in response to either cellular or host stress. However, PTK6-driven signaling events in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain undefined. In a mouse model of TNBC, manipulation of PTK6 levels (i.e., via knock-out or add-back) had little effect on primary tumor volume, but altered lung metastasis. To delineate the mechanisms of PTK6 downstream signaling, we created kinase-dead (KM) and kinase-intact domain structure mutants of PTK6 via in-frame deletions of the N-terminal SH3 or SH2 domains. While the PTK6 kinase domain contributed to soft-agar colony formation, PTK6 kinase activity was entirely dispensable for cell migration. Specifically, TNBC models expressing a PTK6 variant lacking the SH2 domain (SH2-del PTK6) were unresponsive to growth factor-stimulated cell motility relative to SH3-del, KM, or wild-type PTK6 controls. Reverse-phase protein array revealed that while intact PTK6 mediates spheroid formation via p38 MAPK signaling, the SH2 domain of PTK6 limits this biology, and instead mediates TNBC cell motility via activation of the RhoA and/or AhR signaling pathways. Inhibition of RhoA and/or AhR blocked TNBC cell migration as well as the branching/invasive morphology of PTK6+/AhR+ primary breast tumor tissue organoids. Inhibition of RhoA also enhanced paclitaxel cytotoxicity in TNBC cells, including in a taxane-refractory TNBC model. IMPLICATIONS: The SH2-domain of PTK6 is a potent effector of advanced cancer phenotypes in TNBC via RhoA and AhR, identified herein as novel therapeutic targets in PTK6+ breast tumors.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

30045022        	Upregulation of RASSF1A in Colon Cancer by Suppression of Angiogenesis Signaling and Akt Activation.            	Silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and promotion of angiogenesis are associated with tumor development and metastasis. However, little is known if angiogenic molecules directly control TSGs and vice versa.                A regulatory link between angiogenesis and down regulation of TSGs was evaluated using an anti-cancer agent, andrographolide (AGP) in cancer cells, mouse xenograft tissues and patient derived organoids through gene/protein expression, gene silencing, and immunohistochemical analyses.                AGP treatment demonstrated significant expression of RASSF1A and PTEN TSGs in colon cancer and other cancer cells, mouse tissues and organoids. Depletion of RASSF1A with siRNA limited cyclin D1 and BAX expression. SiRNA depletion of PTEN, upstream regulator of RASSF1A resulted in a 50% reduction in RASSF1A expression. Histopathological analysis of the AGP treated tumor sections showed significant reduction in vessel size, microvascular density and tumor mitotic index suggesting suppression of angiogenesis. This was corroborated by protein analysis demonstrating significant reductions in angiogenesis signaling pathway molecules VEGF165, FOXM1, and pAkt, but significant elevation of the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor Tsp-2. Treatment of cells with exogenous VEGF prevented the suppression of angiogenesis signaling by AGP, resulting in sustained expression of pAkt, an upstream down-regulator of RASSF1A. RASSF1A expression remained low in VEGF treated cells despite the addition of AGP.                Our results demonstrate for the first time that AGP induces RASSF1A expression in colon cancer cells and is dependent on angiogenesis signaling events. Therefore, our research may facilitate novel therapeutic options for advanced colon cancer therapy.                © 2018 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.	
28467820        	Non-equivalence of Wnt and R-spondin ligands during Lgr5+ intestinal stem-cell self-renewal.            	The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway governs diverse developmental, homeostatic and pathological processes. Palmitoylated Wnt ligands engage cell-surface frizzled (FZD) receptors and LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors, enabling β-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF-dependent gene transactivation. Mutations in Wnt downstream signalling components have revealed diverse functions thought to be carried out by Wnt ligands themselves. However, redundancy between the 19 mammalian Wnt proteins and 10 FZD receptors and Wnt hydrophobicity have made it difficult to attribute these functions directly to Wnt ligands. For example, individual mutations in Wnt ligands have not revealed homeostatic phenotypes in the intestinal epithelium-an archetypal canonical, Wnt pathway-dependent, rapidly self-renewing tissue, the regeneration of which is fueled by proliferative crypt Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs). R-spondin ligands (RSPO1-RSPO4) engage distinct LGR4-LGR6, RNF43 and ZNRF3 receptor classes, markedly potentiate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling, and induce intestinal organoid growth in vitro and Lgr5+ ISCs in vivo. However, the interchangeability, functional cooperation and relative contributions of Wnt versus RSPO ligands to in vivo canonical Wnt signalling and ISC biology remain unknown. Here we identify the functional roles of Wnt and RSPO ligands in the intestinal crypt stem-cell niche. We show that the default fate of Lgr5+ ISCs is to differentiate, unless both RSPO and Wnt ligands are present. However, gain-of-function studies using RSPO ligands and a new non-lipidated Wnt analogue reveal that these ligands have qualitatively distinct, non-interchangeable roles in ISCs. Wnt proteins are unable to induce Lgr5+ ISC self-renewal, but instead confer a basal competency by maintaining RSPO receptor expression that enables RSPO ligands to actively drive and specify the extent of stem-cell expansion. This functionally non-equivalent yet cooperative interaction between Wnt and RSPO ligands establishes a molecular precedent for regulation of mammalian stem cells by distinct priming and self-renewal factors, with broad implications for precise control of tissue regeneration.	
28467818        	Surrogate Wnt agonists that phenocopy canonical Wnt and β-catenin signalling.            	Wnt proteins modulate cell proliferation and differentiation and the self-renewal of stem cells by inducing β-catenin-dependent signalling through the Wnt receptor frizzled (FZD) and the co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 to regulate cell fate decisions and the growth and repair of several tissues. The 19 mammalian Wnt proteins are cross-reactive with the 10 FZD receptors, and this has complicated the attribution of distinct biological functions to specific FZD and Wnt subtype interactions. Furthermore, Wnt proteins are modified post-translationally by palmitoylation, which is essential for their secretion, function and interaction with FZD receptors. As a result of their acylation, Wnt proteins are very hydrophobic and require detergents for purification, which presents major obstacles to the preparation and application of recombinant Wnt proteins. This hydrophobicity has hindered the determination of the molecular mechanisms of Wnt signalling activation and the functional importance of FZD subtypes, and the use of Wnt proteins as therapeutic agents. Here we develop surrogate Wnt agonists, water-soluble FZD-LRP5/LRP6 heterodimerizers, with FZD5/FZD8-specific and broadly FZD-reactive binding domains. Similar to WNT3A, these Wnt agonists elicit a characteristic β-catenin signalling response in a FZD-selective fashion, enhance the osteogenic lineage commitment of primary mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells, and support the growth of a broad range of primary human organoid cultures. In addition, the surrogates can be systemically expressed and exhibit Wnt activity in vivo in the mouse liver, regulating metabolic liver zonation and promoting hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in hepatomegaly. These surrogates demonstrate that canonical Wnt signalling can be activated by bi-specific ligands that induce receptor heterodimerization. Furthermore, these easily produced, non-lipidated Wnt surrogate agonists facilitate functional studies of Wnt signalling and the exploration of Wnt agonists for translational applications in regenerative medicine.	
32648540        	Dissecting cell-type-specific metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.            	Tumors are composed of many different cell types including cancer cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Dissecting functional metabolic differences between cell types within a mixed population can be challenging due to the rapid turnover of metabolites relative to the time needed to isolate cells. To overcome this challenge, we traced isotope-labeled nutrients into macromolecules that turn over more slowly than metabolites. This approach was used to assess differences between cancer cell and fibroblast metabolism in murine pancreatic cancer organoid-fibroblast co-cultures and tumors. Pancreatic cancer cells exhibited increased pyruvate carboxylation relative to fibroblasts, and this flux depended on both pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme 1 activity. Consequently, expression of both enzymes in cancer cells was necessary for organoid and tumor growth, demonstrating that dissecting the metabolism of specific cell populations within heterogeneous systems can identify dependencies that may not be evident from studying isolated cells in culture or bulk tissue.                © 2020, Lau et al.	
32656539        	L1CAM defines the regenerative origin of metastasis-initiating cells in colorectal cancer.            	Metastasis-initiating cells with stem-like properties drive cancer lethality, yet their origins and relationship to primary-tumor-initiating stem cells are not known. We show that L1CAM+ cells in human colorectal cancer (CRC) have metastasis-initiating capacity, and we define their relationship to tissue regeneration. L1CAM is not expressed in the homeostatic intestinal epithelium, but is induced and required for epithelial regeneration following colitis and in CRC organoid growth. By using human tissues and mouse models, we show that L1CAM is dispensable for adenoma initiation but required for orthotopic carcinoma propagation, liver metastatic colonization and chemoresistance. L1CAMhigh cells partially overlap with LGR5high stem-like cells in human CRC organoids. Disruption of intercellular epithelial contacts causes E-cadherin-REST transcriptional derepression of L1CAM, switching chemoresistant CRC progenitors from an L1CAMlow to an L1CAMhigh state. Thus, L1CAM dependency emerges in regenerative intestinal cells when epithelial integrity is lost, a phenotype of wound healing deployed in metastasis-initiating cells.	
29684110        	Mechanistic insights into anticancer properties of oligomeric proanthocyanidins from grape seeds in colorectal cancer.            	Although the anticancer properties of oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) from grape seeds have been well recognized, the molecular mechanisms by which they exert anticancer effects are poorly understood. In this study, through comprehensive RNA-sequencing-based gene expression profiling in multiple colorectal cancer cell lines, we for the first time illuminate the genome-wide effects of OPCs from grape seeds in colorectal cancer. Our data revealed that OPCs affect several key cancer-associated genes. In particular, genes involved in cell cycle and DNA replication were most significantly and consistently altered by OPCs across multiple cell lines. Intriguingly, our in vivo experiments showed that OPCs were significantly more potent at decreasing xenograft tumor growth compared with the unfractionated grape seed extract (GSE) that includes the larger polymers of proanthocyanidins. These findings were further confirmed in colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids, wherein OPCs more potently inhibited the formation of organoids compared with GSE. Furthermore, we validated alteration of cell cycle and DNA replication-associated genes in cancer cell lines, mice xenografts as well as patient-derived organoids. Overall, this study provides an unbiased and comprehensive look at the mechanisms by which OPCs exert anticancer properties in colorectal cancer.	
27431370        	Nutrient-Gene Interaction in Colon Cancer, from the Membrane to Cellular Physiology.            	The International Agency for Research on Cancer recently released an assessment classifying red and processed meat as "carcinogenic to humans" on the basis of the positive association between increased consumption and risk for colorectal cancer. Diet, however, can also decrease the risk for colorectal cancer and be used as a chemopreventive strategy. Bioactive dietary molecules, such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, curcumin, and fermentable fiber, have been proposed to exert chemoprotective effects, and their molecular mechanisms have been the focus of research in the dietary/chemoprevention field. Using these bioactives as examples, this review surveys the proposed mechanisms by which they exert their effects, from the nucleus to the cellular membrane. In addition, we discuss emerging technologies involving the culturing of colonic organoids to study the physiological effects of dietary bioactives. Finally, we address future challenges to the field regarding the identification of additional molecular mechanisms and other bioactive dietary molecules that can be utilized in our fight to reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer.	
31450087        	Inhibition of APE1-endonuclease activity affects cell metabolism in colon cancer cells via a p53-dependent pathway.            	The pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) involves different mechanisms, such as genomic and microsatellite instabilities. Recently, a contribution of the base excision repair (BER) pathway in CRC pathology has been emerged. In this context, the involvement of APE1 in the BER pathway and in the transcriptional regulation of genes implicated in tumor progression strongly correlates with chemoresistance in CRC and in more aggressive cancers. In addition, the APE1 interactome is emerging as an important player in tumor progression, as demonstrated by its interaction with Nucleophosmin (NPM1). For these reasons, APE1 is becoming a promising target in cancer therapy and a powerful prognostic and predictive factor in several cancer types. Thus, specific APE1 inhibitors have been developed targeting: i) the endonuclease activity; ii) the redox function and iii) the APE1-NPM1 interaction. Furthermore, mutated p53 is a common feature of advanced CRC. The relationship between APE1 inhibition and p53 is still completely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the endonuclease activity of APE1 triggers p53-mediated effects on cell metabolism in HCT-116 colon cancer cell line. In particular, the inhibition of the endonuclease activity, but not of the redox function or of the interaction with NPM1, promotes p53 activation in parallel to sensitization of p53-expressing HCT-116 cell line to genotoxic treatment. Moreover, the endonuclease inhibitor affects mitochondrial activity in a p53-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrated that 3D organoids derived from CRC patients are susceptible to APE1-endonuclease inhibition in a p53-status correlated manner, recapitulating data obtained with HCT-116 isogenic cell lines. These findings suggest the importance of further studies aimed at testing the possibility to target the endonuclease activity of APE1 in CRC.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

31901081        	Gastric squamous-columnar junction contains a large pool of cancer-prone immature osteopontin responsive Lgr5-CD44+ cells.            	Areas of a junction between two types of epithelia are known to be cancer-prone in many organ systems. However, mechanisms for preferential malignant transformation at the junction areas remain insufficiently elucidated. Here we report that inactivation of tumor suppressor genes Trp53 and Rb1 in the gastric squamous-columnar junction (SCJ) epithelium results in preferential formation of metastatic poorly differentiated neoplasms, which are similar to human gastroesophageal carcinoma. Unlike transformation-resistant antral cells, SCJ cells contain a highly proliferative pool of immature Lgr5-CD44+ cells, which are prone to transformation in organoid assays, comprise early dysplastic lesions, and constitute up to 30% of all neoplastic cells. CD44 ligand osteopontin (OPN) is preferentially expressed in and promotes organoid formation ability and transformation of the SCJ glandular epithelium. OPN and CD44 overexpression correlate with the worst prognosis of human gastroesophageal carcinoma. Thus, detection and selective targeting of the active OPN-CD44 pathway may have direct clinical relevance.	
33578855        	Neuroblastoma Invasion Strategies Are Regulated by the Extracellular Matrix.            	Neuroblastoma is a paediatric malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system. About half of the patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and a survival rate of less than 50%. Our understanding of the cellular processes promoting neuroblastoma metastases will be facilitated by the development of appropriate experimental models. In this study, we aimed to explore the invasion of neuroblastoma cells and organoids from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) grown embedded in 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels by time-lapse microscopy and quantitative image analysis. We found that the ECM composition influenced the growth, viability and local invasion of organoids. The ECM compositions induced distinct cell behaviours, with Matrigel being the preferred substratum for local organoid invasion. Organoid invasion was cell line- and PDX-dependent. We identified six distinct phenotypes in PDX-derived organoids. In contrast, NB cell lines were more phenotypically restricted in their invasion strategies, as organoids isolated from cell line-derived xenografts displayed a broader range of phenotypes compared to clonal cell line clusters. The addition of FBS and bFGF induced more aggressive cell behaviour and a broader range of phenotypes. In contrast, the repression of the prognostic neuroblastoma marker, MYCN, resulted in less aggressive cell behaviour. The combination of PDX organoids, real-time imaging and the novel 3D culture assays developed herein will enable rapid progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that control neuroblastoma invasion.	
31494503        	Modulation of redox metabolism negates cancer-associated fibroblasts-induced treatment resistance in a heterotypic 3D culture platform of pancreatic cancer.            	The complex interplay between cancer cells and their microenvironment remains a major challenge in the design and optimization of treatment strategies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Recent investigations have demonstrated that mechanistically distinct combination therapies hold promise for treatment of PDAC, but effective clinical translation requires more accurate models that account for the abundant tumor-stroma and its influence on cancer growth, metabolism and treatment insensitivity. In this study, a modular 3D culture model that comprised PDAC cells and patient-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was developed to assess the effects of PDAC-CAF interactions on treatment efficacies. Using newly-developed high-throughput imaging and image analysis tools, it was found that CAFs imparted a notable and statistically significant resistance to oxaliplatin chemotherapy and benzoporphyrin derivative-mediated photodynamic therapy, which associated with increased levels of basal oxidative metabolism. Increased treatment resistance and redox states were similarly observed in an orthotopic xenograft model of PDAC in which cancer cells and CAFs were co-implanted in mice. Combination therapies of oxaliplatin and PDT with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor metformin overcame CAF-induced treatment resistance. The findings underscore that heterotypic microtumor culture models recapitulate metabolic alterations stemming from tumor-stroma interactions. The presented infrastructure can be adapted with disease-specific cell types and is compatible with patient-derived tissues to enable personalized screening and optimization of new metabolism-targeted treatment regimens for pancreatic cancer.

29590641        	Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: genes, therapies and models.            	Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) refer to a group of heterogeneous cancers of neuroendocrine cell phenotype that mainly fall into one of two subtypes: gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs; well differentiated) or gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (GEP-NECs; poorly differentiated). Although originally defined as orphan cancers, their steadily increasing incidence highlights the need to better understand their etiology. Accumulating epidemiological and clinical data have shed light on the pathological characteristics of these diseases. However, the relatively low number of patients has hampered conducting large-scale clinical trials and hence the development of novel treatment strategies. To overcome this limitation, tractable disease models that faithfully reflect clinical features of these diseases are needed. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of the genetics and biology of these diseases based on conventional disease models, such as genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and cell lines, and discuss the phenotypic differences between the models and affected humans. We also highlight the emerging disease models derived from human clinical samples, including patient-derived xenograft models and organoids, which may provide biological and therapeutic insights into GEP-NENs.                © 2018.

33217475        	Nanoscale platform for delivery of active IRINOX to combat pancreatic cancer.            	Due to its late diagnosis and dismal prognosis, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most devastating solid malignancies, with only 9% of patients surviving after being diagnosed. A multidrug chemotherapeutic regimen FOL-F-IRIN-OX (combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) offers survival benefits superior to that of gemcitabine single agent, but the treatment-related side effects are also severe. To overcome this therapeutic barrier, we developed polymeric micelles bearing active formats of irinotecan and oxaliplatin, SN38 and 1,2-diaminocyclohexane‑platinum (II), DACHPt. Crosslinked micelles were prepared using amphiphilic PEG-b-poly(L-glutamic acid)/SN38 conjugates and subsequently loaded with DACHPt. The dual drug-loaded micelles exhibited improved colloidal stability, prolonged drug release and remarkable cytotoxicity in human pancreatic cancer cell lines and KrasG12D; Trp52R172H/+; Pdx-1 Cre murine tumor organoids models. In vivo, (SN38 + DACHPt)-loaded micelles displayed superior antitumor and antimetastatic activities without impairing safety. Our results suggest that nanomedicine mimicking irinotecan and oxaliplatin as parts of FOLFIRINOX regimen may further improve the feasibility of this multidrug treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

28889384        	Spheroid Cultures of Primary Urothelial Cancer Cells: Cancer Tissue-Originated Spheroid (CTOS) Method.            	Increasingly, it has been recognized that studying cancer samples from individual patients is important for the development of effective therapeutic strategies and in endeavors to overcome therapy resistance. Primary cultures of cancer cells acutely dissected from individual patients can provide a platform that enables the study and characterization of individual tumors. To that end, we have developed a method for preparing cancer cells in the form of multi-cellular spheroids. The cells can be derived from patient tumors (primary cells), from patient-derived xenografts, or from genetically- or chemically induced animal tumors. This method of culturing spheroids composed of cells derived from cancer tissues can be applied to various types of cancer, including urothelial cancer. The method is based on the principle of retaining cell-cell contact throughout cancer cell preparation and culturing. The first step is a partial digestion of the tumor specimen into small fragments; these fragments spontaneously form spheroidal shapes within several hours. The spheroid is referred to as a cancer tissue-originated spheroid (CTOS). The advantage of the CTOS method is that it allows one to prepare pure cancer cells at high yield. CTOSs can be stably cultured in serum-free conditions. The CTOS method can be applied to drug sensitivity assays, drug screening, and analyses of intracellular signaling. Moreover, the CTOS method provides a platform for studying the nature of cancer cell clusters.	
30923113        	Energetic regulation of coordinated leader-follower dynamics during collective invasion of breast cancer cells.            	The ability of primary tumor cells to invade into adjacent tissues, followed by the formation of local or distant metastasis, is a lethal hallmark of cancer. Recently, locomoting clusters of tumor cells have been identified in numerous cancers and associated with increased invasiveness and metastatic potential. However, how the collective behaviors of cancer cells are coordinated and their contribution to cancer invasion remain unclear. Here we show that collective invasion of breast cancer cells is regulated by the energetic statuses of leader and follower cells. Using a combination of in vitro spheroid and ex vivo organoid invasion models, we found that cancer cells dynamically rearrange leader and follower positions during collective invasion. Cancer cells invade cooperatively in denser collagen matrices by accelerating leader-follower switching thus decreasing leader cell lifetime. Leader cells exhibit higher glucose uptake than follower cells. Moreover, their energy levels, as revealed by the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio, must exceed a threshold to invade. Forward invasion of the leader cell gradually depletes its available energy, eventually leading to leader-follower transition. Our computational model based on intracellular energy homeostasis successfully recapitulated the dependence of leader cell lifetime on collagen density. Experiments further supported model predictions that decreasing the cellular energy level by glucose starvation decreases leader cell lifetime whereas increasing the cellular energy level by AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation does the opposite. These findings highlight coordinated invasion and its metabolic regulation as potential therapeutic targets of cancer.	
32393735        	Loss of wild-type p53 promotes mutant p53-driven metastasis through acquisition of survival and tumor-initiating properties.            	Missense-type mutant p53 plays a tumor-promoting role through gain-of-function (GOF) mechanism. In addition, the loss of wild-type TP53 through loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is widely found in cancer cells. However, malignant progression induced by cooperation of TP53 GOF mutation and LOH remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mouse intestinal tumors carrying Trp53 GOF mutation with LOH (AKTPM/LOH) are enriched in metastatic lesions when heterozygous Trp53 mutant cells (AKTP+/M) are transplanted. We show that Trp53 LOH is required for dormant cell survival and clonal expansion of cancer cells. Moreover, AKTPM/LOH cells show an increased in vivo tumor-initiating ability compared with AKTPNull and AKTP+/M cells. RNAseq analyses reveal that inflammatory and growth factor/MAPK pathways are specifically activated in AKTPM/LOH cells, while the stem cell signature is upregulated in both AKTPM/LOH and AKTPNull cells. These results indicate that TP53/Trp53 LOH promotes TP53/Trp53 GOF mutation-driven metastasis through the activation of distinct pathway combination.

32646644        	Simplified low-cost methodology to establish, histologically process and analyze three-dimensional cancer cell spheroid arrays.            	Differently of two-dimensional cell culture, three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroid model allows cells to establish cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions over the entire cell surface, more closely mimicking tumor microenvironments and cellular subpopulations with specific standards of morphology, differentiation and gene expression. Thenceforth several methodologies involving or the 3D cell aggregates generation or its histological processing and analysis have emerged, but in general they are laborious, expensive and complex to set up as a routine technique. Thus, we developed a complete methodology, detailing a simple, accessible and low-cost step by step, including 1) the 3D cell aggregate generation using hanging drop technique; 2) providing a simple way to assess morphological parameters of generated spheroids; followed by 3) a multiple and organized histological processing, keeping several individual spheroids inside an agarose apparatus, maintaining a known order and position of each ones, similar to tissue microarray principle; 4) until the last step, where it is allowed a simultaneous histological composition analysis of several spheroid slices, organized side by side, in a same block section, through conventional stainings or 5) immunostaining against different molecular markers. Therefore, the present methodology aims to popularize 3D cell culture, allowing to make this a regular technique in basic cell biology research, once all steps are performed without using onerous reagents, materials or equipment. In addition to bring the agarose apparatus as a simple low cost novelty, allowing high-throughput analysis of several spheroids simultaneously in an organized manner.

31266962        	Cell type-dependent differential activation of ERK by oncogenic KRAS in colon cancer and intestinal epithelium.            	Oncogenic mutations in KRAS or BRAF are frequent in colorectal cancer and activate the ERK kinase. Here, we find graded ERK phosphorylation correlating with cell differentiation in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids with and without KRAS mutations. Using reporters, single cell transcriptomics and mass cytometry, we observe cell type-specific phosphorylation of ERK in response to transgenic KRASG12V in mouse intestinal organoids, while transgenic BRAFV600E activates ERK in all cells. Quantitative network modelling from perturbation data reveals that activation of ERK is shaped by cell type-specific MEK to ERK feed forward and negative feedback signalling. We identify dual-specificity phosphatases as candidate modulators of ERK in the intestine. Furthermore, we find that oncogenic KRAS, together with β-Catenin, favours expansion of crypt cells with high ERK activity. Our experiments highlight key differences between oncogenic BRAF and KRAS in colorectal cancer and find unexpected heterogeneity in a signalling pathway with fundamental relevance for cancer therapy.	
32719361        	MiR-3622a-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by reducing stemness features and EMT through targeting spalt-like transcription factor 4.            	MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs which act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors through targeting specific mRNAs. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. MiR-3622a-3p is found to be decreased in colorectal cancer (CRC) by analyzing data from TCGA database and there are few reports about the role of miR-3622a-3p in cancers. Our research aimed to explore the effects of miR-3622a-3p on CRC. MiR-3622a-3p was found to be down-regulated in CRC tissues and cells by qRT-PCR. The effect of miR-3622a-3p on proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration and invasion of CRC cells were investigated by a serious of biological function assays and the results revealed that miR-3622a-3p could inhibit the malignant biological properties of CRC. We performed dual luciferase assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and pull-down assay to confirm the interaction between miR-3622a-3p and spalt-like transcription factor 4 (SALL4). Western blot was carried out to determine the effects of miR-3622a-3p and SALL4 on stemness features and EMT. We found that miR-3622a-3p suppressed stemness features and EMT of CRC cells by SALL4 mRNA degradation. MiR-3622a-3p could inhibit CRC cell proliferation and metastasis in vivo with tumor xenograft model and in vivo metastasis model. The CRC organoid model was constructed with fresh CRC tissues and the growth of organoids was suppressed by miR-3622a-3p. Taken together, the results of our study indicate miR-3622a-3p exerts antioncogenic role in CRC by downregulation of SALL4. The research on miR-3622a-3p might provide a new insight into treatment of CRC.	
27123066        	Apigenin suppresses colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion via inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.            	Abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has a significant role in human tumorigenesis. The search for potential anticancer drugs has included widespread screening of inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway. Recently, one of the most common flavonoids, apigenin, demonstrated potential anti-tumor effects on multiple human cancer cell lines, with low cytotoxicity and no mutagenic activity. However, the association between apigenin and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway remains to be elucidated. The results of wound healing and Transwell invasion assays revealed that apigenin was able to significantly suppress colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. An organoid culture assay revealed that apigenin was also able to suppress the growth of intestinal organoids. Furthermore, apigenin inhibited β-catenin/T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor signaling activation, which was induced by LiCl in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibited β-catenin nuclear entry, and therefore the expression of Wnt downstream target genes. In conclusion, apigenin significantly suppressed colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and organoid growth by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.	
31896605        	Network Inference Analysis Identifies SETDB1 as a Key Regulator for Reverting Colorectal Cancer Cells into Differentiated Normal-Like Cells.            	Cancer cells exhibit properties of cells in a less differentiated state than the adjacent normal cells in the tissue. We explored whether cancer cells can be converted to a differentiated normal-like state by restoring the gene regulatory network (GRN) of normal cells. Here, we report that colorectal cancer cells exhibit a range of developmental states from embryonic and intestinal stem-like cells to differentiated normal-like cells. To identify the transcription factors (TF) that commit stem-like colorectal cancer cells into a differentiated normal-like state, we reconstructed GRNs of normal colon mucosa and identified core TFs (CDX2, ELF3, HNF4G, PPARG, and VDR) that govern the cellular state. We further found that SET Domain Bifurcated 1 (SETDB1), a histone H3 lysine 9-specific methyltransferase, hinders the function of the identified TFs. SETDB1 depletion effectively converts stem-like colorectal cancer cells into postmitotic cells and restores normal morphology in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids. RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that SETDB1 depletion recapitulates global gene expression profiles of normal differentiated cells by restoring the transcriptional activity of core TFs on their target genes. IMPLICATIONS: Our study provides insights into the molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the developmental hierarchy of colorectal cancer and suggests that induction of a postmitotic state may be a therapeutic alternative to destruction of cancer cells.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30647431        	Modelling cancer in microfluidic human organs-on-chips.            	One of the problems that has slowed the development and approval of new anticancer therapies is the lack of preclinical models that can be used to identify key molecular, cellular and biophysical features of human cancer progression. This is because most in vitro cancer models fail to faithfully recapitulate the local tissue and organ microenvironment in which tumours form, which substantially contributes to the complex pathophysiology of the disease. More complex in vitro cancer models have been developed, including transwell cell cultures, spheroids and organoids grown within flexible extracellular matrix gels, which better mimic normal and cancerous tissue development than cells maintained on conventional 2D substrates. But these models still lack the tissue-tissue interfaces, organ-level structures, fluid flows and mechanical cues that cells experience within living organs, and furthermore, it is difficult to collect samples from the different tissue microcompartments. In this Review, we outline how recent developments in microfluidic cell culture technology have led to the generation of human organs-on-chips (also known as organ chips) that are now being used to model cancer cell behaviour within human-relevant tissue and organ microenvironments in vitro. Organ chips enable experimentalists to vary local cellular, molecular, chemical and biophysical parameters in a controlled manner, both individually and in precise combinations, while analysing how they contribute to human cancer formation and progression and responses to therapy. We also discuss the challenges that must be overcome to ensure that organ chip models meet the needs of cancer researchers, drug developers and clinicians interested in personalized medicine.

30146160        	Chromosome Segregation Fidelity in Epithelia Requires Tissue Architecture.            	Much of our understanding of chromosome segregation is based on cell culture systems. Here, we examine the importance of the tissue environment for chromosome segregation by comparing chromosome segregation fidelity across several primary cell types in native and nonnative contexts. We discover that epithelial cells have increased chromosome missegregation outside of their native tissues. Using organoid culture systems, we show that tissue architecture, specifically integrin function, is required for accurate chromosome segregation. We find that tissue architecture enhances the correction of merotelic microtubule-kinetochore attachments, and this is especially important for maintaining chromosome stability in the polyploid liver. We propose that disruption of tissue architecture could underlie the widespread chromosome instability across epithelial cancers. Moreover, our findings highlight the extent to which extracellular context can influence intrinsic cellular processes and the limitations of cell culture systems for studying cells that naturally function within a tissue.

29684311        	TFAM is required for maturation of the fetal and adult intestinal epithelium.            	During development, the embryo transitions from a metabolism favoring glycolysis to a metabolism favoring mitochondrial respiration. How metabolic shifts regulate developmental processes, or how developmental processes regulate metabolic shifts, remains unclear. To test the requirement of mitochondrial function in developing endoderm-derived tissues, we genetically inactivated the mitochondrial transcription factor, Tfam, using the Shh-Cre driver. Tfam mutants did not survive postnatally, exhibiting defects in lung development. In the developing intestine, TFAM-loss was tolerated until late fetal development, during which the process of villus elongation was compromised. While progenitor cell populations appeared unperturbed, markers of enterocyte maturation were diminished and villi were blunted. Loss of TFAM was also tested in the adult intestinal epithelium, where enterocyte maturation was similarly dependent upon the mitochondrial transcription factor. While progenitor cells in the transit amplifying zone of the adult intestine remained proliferative, intestinal stem cell renewal was dependent upon TFAM, as indicated by molecular profiling and intestinal organoid formation assays. Taken together, these studies point to critical roles for the mitochondrial regulator TFAM for multiple aspects of intestinal development and maturation, and highlight the importance of mitochondrial regulators in tissue development and homeostasis.

32025032        	AQP5 enriches for stem cells and cancer origins in the distal stomach.            	LGR5 marks resident adult epithelial stem cells at the gland base in the mouse pyloric stomach1, but the identity of the equivalent human stem cell population remains unknown owing to a lack of surface markers that facilitate its prospective isolation and validation. In mouse models of intestinal cancer, LGR5+ intestinal stem cells are major sources of cancer following hyperactivation of the WNT pathway2. However, the contribution of pyloric LGR5+ stem cells to gastric cancer following dysregulation of the WNT pathway-a frequent event in gastric cancer in humans3-is unknown. Here we use comparative profiling of LGR5+ stem cell populations along the mouse gastrointestinal tract to identify, and then functionally validate, the membrane protein AQP5 as a marker that enriches for mouse and human adult pyloric stem cells. We show that stem cells within the AQP5+ compartment are a source of WNT-driven, invasive gastric cancer in vivo, using newly generated Aqp5-creERT2 mouse models. Additionally, tumour-resident AQP5+ cells can selectively initiate organoid growth in vitro, which indicates that this population contains potential cancer stem cells. In humans, AQP5 is frequently expressed in primary intestinal and diffuse subtypes of gastric cancer (and in metastases of these subtypes), and often displays altered cellular localization compared with healthy tissue. These newly identified markers and mouse models will be an invaluable resource for deciphering the early formation of gastric cancer, and for isolating and characterizing human-stomach stem cells as a prerequisite for harnessing the regenerative-medicine potential of these cells in the clinic.	
33093266        	Trends in the development of human stem cell-based non-animal drug testing models.            	In vivo animal models are limited in their ability to mimic the extremely complex systems of the human body, and there is increasing disquiet about the ethics of animal research. Many authorities in different geographical areas are considering implementing a ban on animal testing, including testing for cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, there is a need for research into systems that can replicate the responses of laboratory animals and simulate environments similar to the human body in a laboratory. An in vitro two-dimensional cell culture model is widely used, because such a system is relatively inexpensive, easy to implement, and can gather considerable amounts of reference data. However, these models lack a real physiological extracellular environment. Recent advances in stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and microfabrication techniques have facilitated the development of various 3D cell culture models. These include multicellular spheroids, organoids, and organs-on-chips, each of which has its own advantages and limitations. Organoids are organ-specific cell clusters created by aggregating cells derived from pluripotent, adult, and cancer stem cells. Patient-derived organoids can be used as models of human disease in a culture dish. Biomimetic organ chips are models that replicate the physiological and mechanical functions of human organs. Many organoids and organ-on-a-chips have been developed for drug screening and testing, so competition for patents between countries is also intensifying. We analyzed the scientific and technological trends underlying these cutting-edge models, which are developed for use as non-animal models for testing safety and efficacy at the nonclinical stages of drug development.	
32046982        	ETV4 Is Necessary for Estrogen Signaling and Growth in Endometrial Cancer Cells.            	Estrogen signaling through estrogen receptor alpha (ER) plays a major role in endometrial cancer risk and progression, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying ER's regulatory role in endometrial cancer are poorly understood. In breast cancer cells, ER genomic binding is enabled by FOXA1 and GATA3, but the transcription factors that control ER genomic binding in endometrial cancer cells remain unknown. We previously identified ETV4 as a candidate factor controlling ER genomic binding in endometrial cancer cells, and here we explore the functional importance of ETV4. Homozygous deletion of ETV4, using CRISPR/Cas9, led to greatly reduced ER binding at the majority of loci normally bound by ER. Consistent with the dramatic loss of ER binding, the gene expression response to estradiol was dampened for most genes. ETV4 contributes to estrogen signaling in two distinct ways. ETV4 loss affects chromatin accessibility at some ER bound loci and impairs ER nuclear translocation. The diminished estrogen signaling upon ETV4 deletion led to decreased growth, particularly in 3D culture, where hollow organoids were formed and in vivo in the context of estrogen-dependent growth. These results show that ETV4 plays an important role in estrogen signaling in endometrial cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) is a key oncogene in endometrial cancer. This study uncovers ETV4 as an important factor in controlling the activity of ER and the growth of endometrial cancer cells.

30827941        	Cellular Plasticity of Defa4Cre-Expressing Paneth Cells in Response to Notch Activation and Intestinal Injury.            	Loss of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5-positive crypt base columnar cells provides permissive conditions for different facultative stem cell populations to dedifferentiate and repopulate the stem cell compartment. In this study, we used a defensin α4-Cre recombinase (Defa4Cre) line to define the potential of Paneth cells to dedifferentiate and contribute to intestinal stem cell (ISC) maintenance during normal homeostasis and after intestinal injury.                Small intestine and enteroids from Defa4Cre;Rosa26 tandem dimer Tomato (tdTomato), a red fluoresent protein, (or Rosa26 Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP)) reporter, Notch gain-of-function (Defa4Cre;Rosa26 Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD)-ires-nuclear Green Fluorescent Protein (nGFP) and Defa4Cre;Rosa26reverse tetracycline transactivator-ires Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP);TetONICD), A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) loss-of-function (Defa4Cre;ADAM10flox/flox), and Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) inactivation (Defa4Cre;APCflox/flox) mice were analyzed. Doxorubicin treatment was used as an acute intestinal injury model. Lineage tracing, proliferation, and differentiation were assessed in vitro and in vivo.                Defa4Cre-expressing cells are fated to become mature Paneth cells and do not contribute to ISC maintenance during normal homeostasis in vivo. However, spontaneous lineage tracing was observed in enteroids, and fluorescent-activated cell sorter-sorted Defa4Cre-marked cells showed clonogenic enteroid growth. Notch activation in Defa4Cre-expressing cells caused dedifferentiation to multipotent ISCs in vivo and was required for adenoma formation. ADAM10 deletion had no significant effect on crypt homeostasis. However, after acute doxorubicin-induced injury, Defa4Cre-expressing cells contributed to regeneration in an ADAM10-Notch-dependent manner.                Our studies have shown that Defa4Cre-expressing Paneth cells possess cellular plasticity, can dedifferentiate into multipotent stem cells upon Notch activation, and can contribute to intestinal regeneration in an acute injury model.

32198375        	Degree and site of chromosomal instability define its oncogenic potential.            	Most human cancers are aneuploid, due to a chromosomal instability (CIN) phenotype. Despite being hallmarks of cancer, however, the roles of CIN and aneuploidy in tumor formation have not unequivocally emerged from animal studies and are thus still unclear. Using a conditional mouse model for diverse degrees of CIN, we find that a particular range is sufficient to drive very early onset spontaneous adenoma formation in the intestine. In mice predisposed to intestinal cancer (ApcMin/+), moderate CIN causes a remarkable increase in adenoma burden in the entire intestinal tract and especially in the distal colon, which resembles human disease. Strikingly, a higher level of CIN promotes adenoma formation in the distal colon even more than moderate CIN does, but has no effect in the small intestine. Our results thus show that CIN can be potently oncogenic, but that certain levels of CIN can have contrasting effects in distinct tissues.	
28749339        	PTEN controls glandular morphogenesis through a juxtamembrane β-Arrestin1/ARHGAP21 scaffolding complex.            	PTEN controls three-dimensional (3D) glandular morphogenesis by coupling juxtamembrane signaling to mitotic spindle machinery. While molecular mechanisms remain unclear, PTEN interacts through its C2 membrane-binding domain with the scaffold protein β-Arrestin1. Because β-Arrestin1 binds and suppresses the Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein ARHGAP21, we hypothesize that PTEN controls Cdc42 -dependent morphogenic processes through a β-Arrestin1-ARHGAP21 complex. Here, we show that PTEN knockdown (KD) impairs β-Arrestin1 membrane localization, β-Arrestin1-ARHGAP21 interactions, Cdc42 activation, mitotic spindle orientation and 3D glandular morphogenesis. Effects of PTEN deficiency were phenocopied by β-Arrestin1 KD or inhibition of β-Arrestin1-ARHGAP21 interactions. Conversely, silencing of ARHGAP21 enhanced Cdc42 activation and rescued aberrant morphogenic processes of PTEN-deficient cultures. Expression of the PTEN C2 domain mimicked effects of full-length PTEN but a membrane-binding defective mutant of the C2 domain abrogated these properties. Our results show that PTEN controls multicellular assembly through a membrane-associated regulatory protein complex composed of β-Arrestin1, ARHGAP21 and Cdc42.	
21613543        	Down-regulation of epithelial cadherin is required to initiate metastatic outgrowth of breast cancer.            	Reduced epithelial cadherin (E-cad) is a hallmark of invasive carcinomas that have acquired epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes. Here we show that down-regulated E-cad expression induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and EMT preceded breast cancer outgrowth in three-dimensional (3D) organotypic assays and in the lungs of mice. Pharmacological inhibitors against focal adhesion kinase prevented metastatic outgrowth of newly seeded organoids, but not that of their fully established counterparts. Interrogating the D2-HAN (hyperplastic alveolar nodule) model of breast cancer dormancy and metastasis showed that dormant D2.OR cells produced branched organoid morphologies in 3D-cultures, and expressed robust quantities of E-cad that was uncoupled from regulation by TGF-β. In contrast, metastatic D2.A1 organoids were spherical and wholly lacked E-cad expression. Interestingly, D2.A1 cells engineered to re-express E-cad formed branched organoids, down-regulated β1 integrin expression, and failed to undergo metastatic outgrowth. The tumor-suppressing function of E-cad was inactivated by increased microenvironmental rigidity, and was not recapitulated by expression of an E-cad mutant lacking its extracellular domain. Twist expression, but not that of Snail, reinitiated metastatic outgrowth in dormant D2.OR cells. Our findings show that EMT and its down-regulated expression of E-cad circumvent breast cancer dormancy in part by facilitating β1 integrin expression necessary for metastatic outgrowth.	
33065020        	Control of Glucocorticoid Receptor Levels by PTEN Establishes a Failsafe Mechanism for Tumor Suppression.            	The PTEN tumor suppressor controls cell death and survival by regulating functions of various molecular targets. While the role of PTEN lipid-phosphatase activity on PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and inhibition of PI3K pathway is well characterized, the biological relevance of PTEN protein-phosphatase activity remains undefined. Here, using knockin (KI) mice harboring cancer-associated and functionally relevant missense mutations, we show that although loss of PTEN lipid-phosphatase function cooperates with oncogenic PI3K to promote rapid mammary tumorigenesis, the additional loss of PTEN protein-phosphatase activity triggered an extensive cell death response evident in early and advanced mammary tumors. Omics and drug-targeting studies revealed that PI3Ks act to reduce glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels, which are rescued by loss of PTEN protein-phosphatase activity to restrain cell survival. Thus, we find that the dual regulation of GR by PI3K and PTEN functions as a rheostat that can be exploited for the treatment of PTEN loss-driven cancers.

31020786        	Concise Review: Precision Matchmaking: Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Meet Cardio-Oncology.            	As common chemotherapeutic agents are associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic cardiovascular complications, a new clinical discipline, cardio-oncology, has recently emerged. At the same time, the development of preclinical human stem cell-derived cardiovascular models holds promise as a more faithful platform to predict the cardiovascular toxicity of common cancer therapies and advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to the cardiotoxicity. In this article, we review the recent advances in preclinical cancer-related cardiotoxicity testing, focusing on new technologies, such as human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and tissue engineering. We further discuss some of the limitations of these technologies and present future directions. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2019;8:758&767.                © 2019 The Authors.

30496141        	Chromatin remodeling ATPase BRG1 and PTEN are synthetic lethal in prostate cancer.            	Loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) represents one hallmark of prostate cancer (PCa). However, restoration of PTEN or inhibition of the activated PI3K/AKT pathway has shown limited success, prompting us to identify obligate targets for disease intervention. We hypothesized that PTEN loss might expose cells to unique epigenetic vulnerabilities. Here, we identified a synthetic lethal relationship between PTEN and Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), an ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Higher BRG1 expression in tumors with low PTEN expression was associated with a worse clinical outcome. Genetically engineered mice (GEMs) and organoid assays confirmed that ablation of PTEN sensitized the cells to BRG1 depletion. Mechanistically, PTEN loss stabilized BRG1 protein through the inhibition of the AKT/GSK3β/FBXW7 axis. Increased BRG1 expression in PTEN-deficient PCa cells led to chromatin remodeling into configurations that drove a protumorigenic transcriptome, causing cells to become further addicted to BRG1. Furthermore, we showed in preclinical models that BRG1 antagonist selectively inhibited the progression of PTEN-deficient prostate tumors. Together, our results highlight the synthetic lethal relationship between PTEN and BRG1 and support targeting BRG1 as an effective approach to the treatment of PTEN-deficient PCa.	
33440351        	Alginate-gelatin-Matrigel hydrogels enable the development and multigenerational passaging of patient-derived 3D bioprinted cancer spheroid models.            	Hydrogels consisting of controlled fractions of alginate, gelatin, and Matrigel enable the development of patient-derived bioprinted tissue models that support cancer spheroid growth and expansion. These engineered models can be dissociated to be then reintroduced to new hydrogel solutions and subsequently reprinted to generate multigenerational models. The process of harvesting cells from 3D bioprinted models is possible by chelating the ions that crosslink alginate, causing the gel to weaken. Inclusion of the gelatin and Matrigel fractions to the hydrogel increases the bioactivity by providing cell-matrix binding sites and promoting cross-talk between cancer cells and their microenvironment. Here we show that immortalized triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and patient-derived gastric adenocarcinoma cells can be reprinted for at least three 21-day culture cycles following bioprinting in the alginate/gelatin/Matrigel hydrogels. Our drug testing results suggest that our 3D bioprinted model can also be used to recapitulate in vivo patient drug response. Furthermore, our results show that iterative bioprinting techniques coupled with alginate biomaterials can be used to maintain and expand patient-derived cancer spheroid cultures for extended periods without compromising cell viability, altering division rates, or disrupting cancer spheroid formation.                © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.	
29636350        	Calcium-Induced Differentiation of Human Colon Adenomas in Colonoid Culture: Calcium Alone versus Calcium with Additional Trace Elements.            	Previous murine studies have demonstrated that dietary Aquamin, a calcium-rich, multi-mineral natural product, suppressed colon polyp formation and transition to invasive tumors more effectively than calcium alone when provided over the lifespan of the animals. In the current study, we compared calcium alone to Aquamin for modulation of growth and differentiation in human colon adenomas in colonoid culture. Colonoids established from normal colonic tissue were examined in parallel. Both calcium alone at 1.5 mmol/L and Aquamin (provided at 1.5 mmol/L calcium) fostered differentiation in the adenoma colonoid cultures as compared with control (calcium at 0.15 mmol/L). When Aquamin was provided at an amount delivering 0.15 mmol/L calcium, adenoma differentiation also occurred, but was not as complete. Characteristic of colonoids undergoing differentiation was a reduction in the number of small, highly proliferative buds and their replacement by fewer but larger buds with smoother surface. Proliferation marker (Ki67) expression was reduced and markers of differentiation (CK20 and occludin) were increased along with E-cadherin translocalization to the cell surface. Additional proteins associated with differentiation/growth control [including histone-1 family members, certain keratins, NF2 (merlin), olfactomedin-4 and metallothioneins] were altered as assessed by proteomics. Immunohistologic expression of NF2 was higher with Aquamin as compared with calcium at either concentration. These findings support the conclusions that (i) calcium (1.5 mmol/L) has the capacity to modulate growth and differentiation in large human colon adenomas and (ii) Aquamin delivering 0.15 mmol/L calcium has effects on proliferation and differentiation not observed when calcium is used alone at this concentration.

30809277        	β-catenin-activated autocrine PDGF/Src signaling is a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.            	K-ras mutation and p53 loss are the most prevalent genetic alterations in pancreatic cancer. In addition to these two alterations, pancreatic tumors frequently contain a third genetic defect. Mutations in the WNT/ß-catenin signaling molecules occur in 15-20% of pancreatic cancer patients and co-exist with K-ras mutation and p53 loss. However, the contribution of the WNT/ß-catenin pathway in pancreatic tumorigenesis is still unclear. Methods: We generated Pdx1-CreKrasG12Dp53L/+APCL/+ (KPA) mice and compared their phenotypes with Pdx1-CreKrasG12Dp53L/+ (KPC) mice. The signaling pathways specifically activated in the KPA mice were investigated and the therapeutic effect by targeting the activated pathways was evaluated. We finally validated our findings in human blood and tumor samples. Results: Survival of the KPA mice was shorter than that of the KPC mice. The KPA cancer cells are highly invasive and exhibit distorted morphology in organoid culture with extensive invadopodia formation and elevated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathway is upregulated in the KPA cancer cells, and PDGF production induced by ß-catenin triggers constitutive activation of the Src kinase via the PDGF receptor in the cells. Serum PDGF concentration of the KPA mice is much higher than that of the normal and KPC mice. The Src inhibitor dasatinib effectively inhibits tumor growth and metastasis of the KPA cancer cells. Patient's serum PDGF level is significantly correlated with the expression of PDGF and phosphor-Src in tumors and elevated PDGF/phosphor-Src level in tumors predicts increased recurrence and poor survival. Moreover, mutations of the WNT/ß-catenin signaling molecules are higher in patients with elevated PDGF/phosphor-Src level. Conclusion: ß-catenin activation, coupled with K-ras mutation and p53 loss, activates an autocrine PDGF/Src signaling in pancreatic cancer and defines a subset of patients who might be sensitive to Src inhibition. In addition, serum PDGF level could be a reliable biomarker for patient selection in clinic.	
31620371        	Identification of SPP1 as an Extracellular Matrix Signature for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.            	Resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the main challenge for advanced fatal prostate cancer (PCa), which can gradually develop into metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, the pathologic mechanisms of mCRPC are still far from clear. Given the high incidence and mortality related to mCRPC, understanding the causes and pathogenesis of this condition as well as identifying potential biomarkers are of great importance. In the research reported here, we integrated several gene expression profiles from hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and mCRPC datasets to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), key biological pathways, and cellular components. We found that extracellular matrix (ECM) genes were significantly enriched, and further filtered them using Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise regression to find ECM signatures to differentiate between the HSPC and mCRPC phenotypes. Six ECM signatures were input into K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and random forest classifiers models. Random forest algorithm with the six-gene prognostic signatures showed best performance, which had high sensitivity and specificity for HSPC and mCRPC classification and further the six ECM signatures were validated in organoid models. Among the six ECM genes, SPP1 was identified as the key hub signature for PCa metastasis and drug resistance development; we found that both protein and mRNA expression levels of SPP1 were remarkably up-regulated in mCRPC compared with HSPC in organoid models and could regulate the androgen receptor signaling pathway. Therefore, SPP1 is a potential novel biomarker and therapeutic target for mCRPC. Further understanding of the role of SPP1 in mCRPC development may help to explore effectively therapeutic approaches for the prevention and intervention of drug resistance and metastasis.

33638919        	Polyvinyl alcohol scaffolds and supplementation support 3D and sphere culturing of human cancer cell lines by reducing apoptosis and promoting cellular proliferation.            	Three-dimensional (3D) culturing mimics the heterogeneous cellular conditions of the in vivo tumor microenvironment compared to 2D monolayer-cultured cells and 3D cultures of established cancer cell lines (sphere culture) or patient-derived cancer cells (organoid culture) are frequently used for cancer research or drug screening and evaluation. To establish more cost and time-efficient 3D culture methods for cancer cell lines, we supplemented sphere culture medium with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and found that 3D sphere cultures of breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were significantly increased. Mechanistically, we found that PVA prevented cell death and promoted cellular proliferation while maintaining levels of stemness-related gene expression. Furthermore, we showed that polyvinyl formal resin (PVF) 3D scaffolds made by crosslinked PVA can function in serum-free, long-term 3D cultures to support maintenance of sphere- or tumor-like cell masses for diverse cancer cell types. Taken together, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PVA and PVF in human cancer cell line culture protocols.                This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	
33119860        	Effects of FGFR inhibitors TKI258, BGJ398 and AZD4547 on breast cancer cells in 2D, 3D and tissue explant cultures.            	Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) and pathways are important players in breast cancer (BC) development. They are commonly altered, and BCs exhibiting FGFR gene amplification are currently being studied for drug development. Here, we aimed to compare the effects of three FGFR inhibitors (FGFRis), i.e., non-selective TKI258 and selective BGJ398 and AZD4547, on different BC-derived cell lines (BCCs) and primary tissues.                The human BCCs MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231(SA) (wild-type FGFR) and MFM223 (amplified FGFR1 and FGFR2) were analyzed for FGFR expression using qRT-PCR, and the effects of FGFRis on FGFR signaling by Western blotting. The effects of FGFRis on proliferation, viability, migration and invasion of BCCs were assessed in 2D cultures using live-cell imaging, and in 3D cultures using phenotypic analysis of organoids. To study radio-sensitization, FGFRi treatment was combined with irradiation. Patient-derived BC samples were treated with FGFRis in explant cultures and immunostained for Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3.                We found that all FGFRis tested decreased the growth and viability of BC cells in 2D and 3D cultures. BGJ398 and AZD4547 were found to be potent at low concentrations in FGFR-amplified MFM233 cells, whereas higher concentrations were required in non-amplified MCF7 and MDA-MB-231(SA) cells. TKI258 inhibited the migration and invasion, whereas BGJ398 and AZD4547 only inhibited the invasion of MDA-MB-231(SA) cells. FGFRi treatment of MCF7 and MFM223 cells enhanced the inhibitory effect of radiotherapy, but this effect was not observed in MDA-MB-231(SA) cells. FGFRi-treated primary BC explants with moderate FGFR levels showed a tendency towards decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis.                Our results indicate that, besides targeting FGFR-amplified BCs with selective FGFRis, also BCs without FGFR amplification/activation may benefit from FGFRi-treatment. Combination with other treatment modalities, such as radiotherapy, may allow the use of FGFRis at relatively low concentrations and, thereby, contribute to better BC treatment outcomes.	
29559559        	Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Mutation (ALK F1174C) in Small Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate and Molecular Response to Alectinib.            	Purpose: Small cell carcinoma of the prostate (SCCP) is an aggressive disease that can arise de novo or by transdifferentiation from prostate adenocarcinoma. Alterations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene are involved in neuroblastoma, lung cancer, and other malignancies, but its role in SCCP has not been documented. We describe a patient with refractory de novo SCCP with ALK F1174C-activating mutation who obtained clinical benefit from treatment with ALK inhibitor.Experimental Design: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze primary and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Prostate cancer databases were queried for alterations in ALK gene, mRNA, and its impact in clinical outcomes. In vitro prostate cell line/organoid models were generated by lentiviral-mediated expression of ALK and ALK F1174C and assessed for response to ALK inhibitors crizotinib and alectinib.Results: NGS analysis of the primary tumor and ctDNA of a 39-year-old patient with refractory SSCP identified ALK F1174C mutation. Treatment with second-generation ALK inhibitor alectinib resulted in radiographic stable disease for over 6 months, symptomatic improvement, and significant molecular response as reflected by declining ctDNA allele fraction. Analysis of prostate cancer datasets showed that ALK amplification was associated with poor outcome. In prostate cancer cells and organoids, ALK F1174C expression enhanced growth and induced expression of the neuroendocrine marker neuron-specific enolase. Alectinib was more effective than crizotinib in inhibiting ALK F1174C-expressing cell growth.Conclusions: These findings implicate ALK-activating mutations in SCCP pathogenesis and suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting ALK molecular alterations in some patients with SCCP.

29756208        	Impact of loss-of-function mutations at the RNF43 locus on colorectal cancer development and progression.            	RNF43 mutations are frequently detected in colorectal cancer cells and lead to a loss of function of the ubiquitin E3 ligase. Here, we investigated the clinical significance of RNF43 mutations in a large Japanese cohort and the role of RNF43 at various stages of colorectal cancer development and progression. Mutation analysis of the RNF43 gene locus with pyrosequencing technology detected RNF43 hotspot mutations in one (0.88%) of 113 colorectal polyp cases and in 30 (6.45%) of 465 colorectal cancer cases. Moreover, patients with colorectal cancer harbouring mutated RNF43 experienced a higher recurrence rate than those harbouring non-mutated RNF43. In addition, the growth of RNF43 wild-type colorectal cancer cell lines was significantly increased by RNF43 silencing. We generated Rnf43 knockout mice in a C57BL/6 N background by using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Although intestinal organoids from Rnf43 knockout mice did not show continuous growth in the absence of R-spondin, an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate mouse model demonstrated that tumours were markedly larger in Rnf43 knockout mice than in wild-type mice. These findings provide evidence that Wnt signalling activation by RNF43 mutations during the tumourigenic stage enhances tumour growth and promotes a high recurrence rate in colorectal cancer patients.

28575679        	Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling, Disease, and Emerging Therapeutic Modalities.            	The WNT signal transduction cascade is a main regulator of development throughout the animal kingdom. Wnts are also key drivers of most types of tissue stem cells in adult mammals. Unsurprisingly, mutated Wnt pathway components are causative to multiple growth-related pathologies and to cancer. Here, we describe the core Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, how it controls stem cells, and contributes to disease. Finally, we discuss strategies for Wnt-based therapies.

33506057        	High Expression of VSTM2L Induced Resistance to Chemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer through Downstream IL-4 Signaling.            	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (pCRT) is a common and essential therapeutic strategy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), but poor tumor response and therapeutic resistance to chemoradiotherapy have appeared usually among persons and affected those patients' survival prognosis. The resistance to chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer is difficult to predict. This study was aimed at evaluating the role of V-set and transmembrane domain containing 2 like protein (VSTM2L) in resistance to chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer.                Analysis of the GEO profiling datasets of rectal cancer patients receiving pCRT disclosed that VSTM2L as a candidate gene was significantly upregulated in nonresponders of rectal cancer with pCRT. The mRNA and protein expression of VSTM2L was detected by quantitate real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry in six rectal cancer biopsy tissues before pCRT. Furthermore, the rectal cancer patient-derived organoids were cultured to evaluate the association of VSTM2L expression and tumor response to CRT. Overexpression of VSTM2L in cancer cells treated with CRT was analyzed for the function of cell proliferation and viability, clone formation, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis ability. The GSEA and RNA-sequence analysis were used to find the downstream mechanism of VSTM2L overexpression in cells treated with CRT.                The mRNA levels of VSTM2L were significantly downregulated in normal rectal tissues compared to tumor tissues and were upregulated in nonresponders of rectal cancer patients receiving pCRT and positively correlated with poor survival prognosis from GEO datasets. High expression of VSTM2L was significantly associated with tumor regression after pCRT (P = 0.030). Moreover, high expression of VSTM2L reduced γ-H2AX expression in rectal cancer patient-derived organoids treated with CRT. The overexpression of VSTM2L in colorectal cancer cells induced resistance to CRT via promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. The molecular mechanism revealed that the overexpression of VSTM2L induced resistance to CRT through downstream IL-4 signaling affecting the progress of cell proliferation and apoptosis.                The high expression of VSTM2L induced resistance to CRT, and adverse survival outcomes served as a prognostic factor in patients with rectal cancer receiving pCRT, suggesting that VSTM2L high expression may be a potential resistant predictable biomarker for LARC patients receiving pCRT.

32824603        	2,4-Diamino-Quinazoline, a Wnt Signaling Inhibitor, Suppresses Gastric Cancer Progression and Metastasis.            	Gastric cancer (GC) is among the most treatment-refractory epithelial malignancies. Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin-signaling has been implicated in a variety of human cancers, including gastric cancer. Here we report that the elevated expression of lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (Lef1) is associated with the TNM (tumor- node-metastasis) stage of gastric cancer. Subsequently, 2,4-diamino-quinazoline (2,4-DAQ), a selective inhibitor of Lef1, was identified to suppress the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes such as AXIN2, MYC and LGR5 and result in the suppression of gastric cancer cell growth through the apoptotic pathway. The 2,4-DAQ also exhibited an inhibitory effect on the migration/invasion of gastric cancer cells. Importantly, the treatment of human gastric tumor xenograft with 2,4-DAQ suppressed tumor growth in a nude mouse model. Furthermore, 2,4-DAQ appears effective on patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Transcriptome sequencing analysis also revealed that 2,4-DAQ are more effective on the gastric cancers that exhibit higher expression levels of Wnt-signaling pathway-related genes than their adjacent normal gastric tissues.	
30135147        	Lack of DNA Damage Response at Low Radiation Doses in Adult Stem Cells Contributes to Organ Dysfunction.            	Radiotherapy for head and neck cancer may result in serious side effects, such as hyposalivation, impairing the patient's quality of life. Modern radiotherapy techniques attempt to reduce the dose to salivary glands, which, however, results in low-dose irradiation of the tissue stem cells. Here we assess the low-dose sensitivity of tissue stem cells and the consequences for tissue function.                Postirradiation rat salivary gland secretory function was determined after pilocarpine induction. Murine and patient-derived salivary gland and thyroid gland organoids were irradiated and clonogenic survival was assessed. The DNA damage response (DDR) was analyzed in organoids and modulated using different radiation modalities, chemical inhibition, and genetic modification.                Relative low-dose irradiation to the high-density stem cell region of rat salivary gland disproportionally impaired function. Hyper-radiosensitivity at doses <1 Gy, followed by relative radioresistance at doses ≥1 Gy, was observed in salivary gland and thyroid gland organoid cultures. DDR modulation resulted in diminished, or even abrogated, relative radioresistance. Furthermore, inhibition of the DDR protein ATM impaired DNA repair after 1 Gy, but not 0.25 Gy. Irradiation of patient-derived salivary gland organoid cells showed similar responses, whereas a single 1 Gy dose to salivary gland-derived stem cells resulted in greater survival than clinically relevant fractionated doses of 4 × 0.25 Gy.                We show that murine and human glandular tissue stem cells exhibit a dose threshold in DDR activation, resulting in low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity, with clinical implications in radiotherapy treatment planning. Furthermore, our results from patient-derived organoids highlight the potential of organoids to study normal tissue responses to radiation.                ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.	
28064442        	Tumor-derived spheroids: Relevance to cancer stem cells and clinical applications.            	Recently, many types of in vitro 3-D culture systems have been developed to recapitulate the in vivo growth conditions of cancer. The cancer 3-D culture methods aim to preserve the biological characteristics of original tumors better than conventional 2-D monolayer cultures, and include tumor-derived organoids, tumor-derived spheroids, organotypic multicellular spheroids, and multicellular tumor spheroids. The 3-D culture methods differ in terms of cancer cell sources, protocols for cell handling, and the required time intervals. Tumor-derived spheroids are unique because they are purposed for the enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or cells with stem cell-related characteristics. These spheroids are grown as floating spheres and have been used as surrogate systems to evaluate the CSC-related characteristics of solid tumors in vitro. Because eradication of CSCs is likely to be of clinical importance due to their association with the malignant nature of cancer cells, such as tumorigenicity or chemoresistance, the investigation of tumor-derived spheroids may provide invaluable clues to fight against cancer. Spheroid cultures have been established from cancers including glioma, breast, colon, ovary, and prostate cancers, and their biological and biochemical characteristics have been investigated by many research groups. In addition to the investigation of CSCs, tumor-derived spheroids may prove to be instrumental for a high-throughput screening platform or for the cultivation of CSC-related tumor cells found in the circulation or body fluids.                © 2017 The Authors.

31588233        	VSTM2A suppresses colorectal cancer and antagonizes Wnt signaling receptor LRP6.            	Hyperactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a critical step in colorectal tumorigenesis. In this study, we identified that V-set and transmembrane domain containing 2A (VSTM2A) was a top-downregulated secreted protein that negatively regulated Wnt singling pathways in colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated the functional mechanisms and clinical implication of VSTM2A in CRC. Methods: Function of VSTM2A was investigated in vitro and in vivo. VSTM2A binding partner was identified by mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation and Western blot. The clinical impact of VSTM2A was assessed in 355 CRC patients and TCGA cohort. Results: VSTM2A protein was prominently silenced in CRC tumor tissues and cell lines mediated by its promoter hypermethylation. VSTM2A DNA promoter hypermethylation and VSTM2A protein downregulation was associated with poor survival of CRC patients. Ectopic expression of VSTM2A inhibited colon cancer cell lines and organoid growth, induced CRC cells apoptosis, inhibited cell migration and invasion, and suppressed growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. VSTM2A was released from CRC cells through a canonical secretion pathway. Secreted VSTM2A significantly suppressed Wnt signaling pathway in colon cancer cells. Wnt signaling co-receptor LDL receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) was identified as a cell membrane binding partner of VSTM2A. Using deletion/mutation and immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that VSTM2A bound to LRP6 E1-4 domain with its IgV domain. VSTM2A suppressed LRP6 phosphorylation in a time and dose dependent manner, and induced LRP6 endocytosis and lysosome-mediated degradation, which collectively contributing to the inactivation of Wnt signaling. Conclusions: VSTM2A is a novel antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling by directly binding to LRP6 and induces LRP6 endocytosis and degradation. VSTM2A is a potential prognostic biomarker for the outcome of CRC patients.                © The author(s).	
31409613        	The Indenoisoquinoline TOP1 Inhibitors Selectively Target Homologous Recombination-Deficient and Schlafen 11-Positive Cancer Cells and Synergize with Olaparib.            	Irinotecan and topotecan are used to treat a variety of different cancers. However, they have limitations, including chemical instability and severe side effects. To overcome these limitations, we developed the clinical indenoisoquinolines: LMP400 (indotecan), LMP776 (indimitecan), and LMP744. The purpose of the study is to build the molecular rationale for phase II clinical trials.                CellMinerCDB (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb) was used to mine the cancer cell lines genomic databases. The causality of Schlafen11 (SLFN11) was validated in isogenic cell lines. Because topoisomerase I (TOP1)-mediated replication DNA damage is repaired by homologous recombination (HR), we tested the "synthetic lethality" of HR-deficient (HRD) cells. Survival and cell-cycle alterations were performed after drug treatments in isogenic DT40, DLD1, and OVCAR cell lines with BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 deficiencies and in organoids cultured from prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts with BRCA2 loss. We also used an ovarian orthotopic allograft model with BRCA1 loss to validate the efficacy of LMP400 and olaparib combination.                CellMinerCDB reveals that SLFN11, which kills cells undergoing replicative stress, is a dominant drug determinant to the clinical indenoisoquinolines. In addition, BRCA1-, BRCA2-, and PALB2-deficient cells were hypersensitive to the indenoisoquinolines. All 3 clinical indenoisoquinolines were also synergistic with olaparib, especially in the HRD cells. The synergy between LMP400 and olaparib was confirmed in the orthotopic allograft model harboring BRCA1 loss.                Our results provide a rationale for molecularly designed clinical trials with the indenoisoquinolines as single agents and in combination with PARP inhibitors in HRD cancers expressing SLFN11.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31486238        	Review: Gastric cancer-Clinical aspects.            	Gastric cancer (GC) was responsible for over 1 000 000 new cases in 2018 and an estimated 783 000 deaths, making it still the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes worldwide. Divergent trends for GC incidence were observed in the USA. Incidence rates, particularly for non-cardia GC, were stable or increasing among persons aged <50 years. In an analysis of data from a public hospital database in Hong Kong, treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection was associated with a lower risk of GC, particularly in older subjects who received treatment ≥10 years before. Based on the results of a 16-year endoscopy-based follow-up eradication trial, patients with incomplete-type intestinal metaplasia (IM) should receive endoscopic surveillance upon H. pylori eradication therapy. Updated guidelines on the endoscopic surveillance of preneoplastic conditions of the stomach (MAPS II) have been published. In the RAINFALL trial, the addition of ramucirumab to a backbone chemotherapy as a first-line regimen failed to improve overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic disease. Also, pembrolizumab did not prolong OS when compared to paclitaxel in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced GC or esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer. Trifluridine/tipiracil improved OS by 2.1 months in the third or further treatment line of patients with advanced GC. In a systematic investigation conducted on Chinese patients with GC, CLDN18-ARHGAP26/6 fusion was associated with signet-ring cell content and was prognostic for a worse outcome and predictive for no benefit from oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Organoid cultures represent an appealing model that may be applied for therapy response testing in the near future.                © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	
32368809        	Palladium(II)-η3 -Allyl Complexes Bearing N-Trifluoromethyl N-Heterocyclic Carbenes: A New Generation of Anticancer Agents that Restrain the Growth of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Tumoroids.            	The first palladium organometallic compounds bearing N-trifluoromethyl N-heterocyclic carbenes have been synthesized. These η3 -allyl complexes are potent antiproliferative agents against different cancer lines (for the most part, IC50 values fall in the range 0.02-0.5 μm). By choosing 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) as co-ligand, we can improve the selectivity toward tumor cells, whereas the introduction of 2-methyl substituents generally reduces the antitumor activity slightly. A series of biochemical assays, aimed at defining the cellular targets of these palladium complexes, has shown that mitochondria are damaged before DNA, thus revealing a behavior substantially different from that of cisplatin and its derivatives. We assume that the specific mechanism of action of these organometallic compounds involves nucleophilic attack on the η3 -allyl fragment. The effectiveness of a representative complex, 4 c, was verified on ovarian cancer tumoroids derived from patients. The results are promising: unlike carboplatin, our compound turned out to be very active and showed a low toxicity toward normal liver organoids.                © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.	
31630812        	AdipoRon Attenuates Wnt Signaling by Reducing Cholesterol-Dependent Plasma Membrane Rigidity.            	The increasing prevalence of adult and adolescent obesity and its associated risk of colorectal cancer reinforces the urgent need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms contributing to the promotion of colon cancer in obese individuals. Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-derived adipokine, whose levels are reduced during obesity. Both epidemiological and preclinical data indicate that adiponectin suppresses colon tumorigenesis. We have previously demonstrated that both adiponectin and AdipoRon, a small-molecule adiponectin receptor agonist, suppress colon cancer risk in part by reducing the number of Lgr5+ stem cells in mouse colonic organoids. However, the mechanism by which the adiponectin signaling pathway attenuates colon cancer risk remains to be addressed. Here, we have hypothesized that adiponectin signaling supports colonic stem cell maintenance through modulation of the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane (PM). Specifically, we investigated the effects of adiponectin receptor activation by AdipoRon on the biophysical perturbations linked to the attenuation of Wnt-driven signaling and cell proliferation as determined by LEF luciferase reporter assay and colonic organoid proliferation, respectively. Using physicochemical sensitive dyes, Di-4-ANEPPDHQ and C-laurdan, we demonstrated that AdipoRon decreased the rigidity of the colonic cell PM. The decrease in membrane rigidity was associated with a reduction in PM free cholesterol levels and the intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol in lysosomes. These results suggest that adiponectin signaling plays a role in modulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis, PM biophysical properties, and Wnt-driven signaling. These findings are noteworthy because they may in part explain how obesity drives colon cancer progression.                Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

30728288        	Suppressing fatty acid uptake has therapeutic effects in preclinical models of prostate cancer.            	Metabolism alterations are hallmarks of cancer, but the involvement of lipid metabolism in disease progression is unclear. We investigated the role of lipid metabolism in prostate cancer using tissue from patients with prostate cancer and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. We showed that fatty acid uptake was increased in human prostate cancer and that these fatty acids were directed toward biomass production. These changes were mediated, at least partly, by the fatty acid transporter CD36, which was associated with aggressive disease. Deleting Cd36 in the prostate of cancer-susceptible Pten-/- mice reduced fatty acid uptake and the abundance of oncogenic signaling lipids and slowed cancer progression. Moreover, CD36 antibody therapy reduced cancer severity in patient-derived xenografts. We further demonstrated cross-talk between fatty acid uptake and de novo lipogenesis and found that dual targeting of these pathways more potently inhibited proliferation of human cancer-derived organoids compared to the single treatments. These findings identify a critical role for CD36-mediated fatty acid uptake in prostate cancer and suggest that targeting fatty acid uptake might be an effective strategy for treating prostate cancer.

29329541        	A role for endothelial nitric oxide synthase in intestinal stem cell proliferation and mesenchymal colorectal cancer.            	Nitric oxide (NO) has been highlighted as an important agent in cancer-related events. Although the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) isoform has received most attention, recent studies in the literature indicate that the endothelial isoenzyme (eNOS) can also modulate different tumor processes including resistance, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. However, the role of eNOS in cancer stem cell (CSC) biology and mesenchymal tumors is unknown.                Here, we show that eNOS was significantly upregulated in VilCre ERT2 Apc fl/+ and VilCre ERT2 Apc fl/fl mouse intestinal tissue, with intense immunostaining in hyperproliferative crypts. Similarly, the more invasive VilCre ERT2 Apc fl/+ Pten fl/+ mouse model showed an overexpression of eNOS in intestinal tumors whereas this isoform was not expressed in normal tissue. However, none of the three models showed iNOS expression. Notably, when 40 human colorectal tumors were classified into different clinically relevant molecular subtypes, high eNOS expression was found in the poor relapse-free and overall survival mesenchymal subtype, whereas iNOS was absent. Furthermore, Apc fl/fl organoids overexpressed eNOS compared with wild-type organoids and NO depletion with the scavenger carboxy-PTIO (c-PTIO) decreased the proliferation and the expression of stem-cell markers, such as Lgr5, Troy, Vav3, and Slc14a1, in these intestinal organoids. Moreover, specific NO depletion also decreased the expression of CSC-related proteins in human colorectal cancer cells such as β-catenin and Bmi1, impairing the CSC phenotype. To rule out the contribution of iNOS in this effect, we established an iNOS-knockdown colorectal cancer cell line. NO-depleted cells showed a decreased capacity to form tumors and c-PTIO treatment in vivo showed an antitumoral effect in a xenograft mouse model.                Our data support that eNOS upregulation occurs after Apc loss, emerging as an unexpected potential new target in poor-prognosis mesenchymal colorectal tumors, where NO scavenging could represent an interesting therapeutic alternative to targeting the CSC subpopulation.	
31645574        	Mithramycin A Inhibits Colorectal Cancer Growth by Targeting Cancer Stem Cells.            	The pivotal role of cancer initiating stem cells (CSCs) in tumor initiation, growth, metastasis and drug resistance has led to the postulation of a 'total cancer therapy' paradigm, which involves targeting both cancer cells and CSCs for effective therapy. However, the progress in identifying drugs for total cancer therapy has been limited. Herein, we show for the first time that mithramycin A (Mit-A) can successfully inhibit CSC proliferation, in addition to inhibiting bulk cancer cells in a model of colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of death among men and women in the United States. To this end, a polymeric nanofiber scaffold culture system was established to develop 3D tumor organoids (tumoroids) from CRC cell lines such as HT29, HCT116, KM12, CT26 and MC38 as well as ex vivo mouse tumors. These tumoroids possessed increased expression of CSC markers and transcription factors, expanded the number of CSCs in culture and increased CSC functional properties measured by aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. Screening of an NCI library of FDA approved drugs led to the identification of Mit-A as a potential total cancer therapy drug. In both sphere and tumoroid culture, Mit-A inhibits cancer growth by reducing the expression of cancer stemness markers. In addition, Mit-A inhibits the expression of SP1, a previously known target in CRCs. Moreover, Mit-A significantly reduces growth of tumoroids in ex vivo cultures and CRC tumor growth in vivo. Finally, a dose-dependent treatment on CRC cells indicate that Mit-A significantly induces the cell death and PARP-cleavage of both CSC and non-CSC cells. Taken together the results of these in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies lead to the inference that Mit-A is a promising drug candidate for total cancer therapy of CRCs.	
30952620        	Gene signatures of quiescent glioblastoma cells reveal mesenchymal shift and interactions with niche microenvironment.            	Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly malignant brain tumor, invariably recurs after therapy. Quiescent GBM cells represent a potential source of tumor recurrence, but little is known about their molecular underpinnings.                Patient-derived GBM cells were engineered by CRISPR/Cas9-assisted knock-in of an inducible histone2B-GFP (iH2B-GFP) reporter to track cell division history. We utilized an in vitro 3D GBM organoid approach to isolate live quiescent GBM (qGBM) cells and their proliferative counterparts (pGBM) to compare stem cell properties and therapy resistance. Gene expression programs of qGBM and pGBM cells were analyzed by RNA-Seq and NanoString platforms.                H2B-GFP-retaining qGBM cells exhibited comparable self-renewal capacity but higher therapy resistance relative to pGBM. Quiescent GBM cells expressed distinct gene programs that affect cell cycle control, metabolic adaptation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Transcriptome analysis also revealed a mesenchymal shift in qGBM cells of both proneural and mesenchymal GBM subtypes. Bioinformatic analyses and functional assays in GBM organoids established hypoxia and TGFβ signaling as potential niche factors that promote quiescence in GBM. Finally, network co-expression analysis of TCGA glioma patient data identified gene modules that are enriched for qGBM signatures and also associated with survival rate.                Our in vitro study in 3D GBM organoids supports the presence of a quiescent cell population that displays self-renewal capacity, high therapy resistance, and mesenchymal gene signatures. It also sheds light on how GBM cells may acquire and maintain quiescence through ECM organization and interaction with niche factors such as TGFβ and hypoxia. Our findings provide a starting point for developing strategies to tackle the quiescent population of GBM.

30816345        	Cancer-induced inflammation and inflammation-induced cancer in colon: a role for S1P lyase.            	A role of sphingolipids for inflammatory bowel disease and cancer is evident. However, the relative and separate contribution of sphingolipid deterioration in inflammation versus carcinogenesis for the pathophysiology of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) was unknown and therefore examined in this study. We performed isogenic bone marrow transplantation of inducible sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase knockout mice to specifically modulate sphingolipids and associated genes and proteins in a compartment-specific way in a DSS/AOM mediated CAC model. 3D organoid cultures were used in vitro. S1P lyase (SGPL1) knockout in either immune cells or tissue, caused local sphingolipid accumulation leading to a dichotomic development of CAC: Immune cell SGPL1 knockout (I-SGPL-/-) augmented massive immune cell infiltration initiating colitis with lesions and calprotectin increase. Pathological crypt remodeling plus extracellular S1P-signaling caused delayed tumor formation characterized by S1P receptor 1, STAT3 mRNA increase, as well as programmed cell death ligand 1 expression, accompanied by a putatively counter regulatory STAT1S727 phosphorylation. In contrast, tissue SGPL1 knockout (T-SGPL-/-) provoked immediate occurrence of epithelial-driven tumors with upregulated sphingosine kinase 1, S1P receptor 2 and epidermal growth factor receptor. Here, progressing carcinogenesis was accompanied by an IL-12 to IL-23 shift with a consecutive development of a Th2/GATA3-driven, tumor-favoring microenvironment. Moreover, the knockout models showed distinct lymphopenia and neutrophilia, different from the full SGPL1 knockout. This study shows that depending on the initiating cellular S1P source, the pathophysiology of inflammation-induced cancer versus cancer-induced inflammation develops through separate, discernible molecular steps.	
30940656        	Auranofin Protects Intestine against Radiation Injury by Modulating p53/p21 Pathway and Radiosensitizes Human Colon Tumor.            	The radiosensitivity of the normal intestinal epithelium is the major limiting factor for definitive radiotherapy against abdominal malignancies. Radiosensitizers, which can be used without augmenting radiation toxicity to normal tissue, are still an unmet need. Inhibition of proteosomal degradation is being developed as a major therapeutic strategy for anticancer therapy as cancer cells are more susceptible to proteasomal inhibition-induced cytotoxicity compared with normal cells. Auranofin, a gold-containing antirheumatoid drug, blocks proteosomal degradation by inhibiting deubiquitinase inhibitors. In this study, we have examined whether auranofin selectively radiosensitizes colon tumors without promoting radiation toxicity in normal intestine.                The effect of auranofin (10 mg/kg i.p.) on the radiation response of subcutaneous CT26 colon tumors and the normal gastrointestinal epithelium was determined using a mouse model of abdominal radiation. The effect of auranofin was also examined in a paired human colonic organoid system using malignant and nonmalignant tissues from the same patient.                Both in the mouse model of intestinal injury and in the human nonmalignant colon organoid culture, auranofin pretreatment prevented radiation toxicity and improved survival with the activation of p53/p21-mediated reversible cell-cycle arrest. However, in a mouse model of abdominal tumor and in human malignant colonic organoids, auranofin inhibited malignant tissue growth with inhibition of proteosomal degradation, induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response, and apoptosis.                Our data suggest that auranofin is a potential candidate to be considered as a combination therapy with radiation to improve therapeutic efficacy against abdominal malignancies.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31370109        	Predictive biomarkers for drug response in bladder cancer.            	Bladder cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Interpatient heterogeneity in response to a drug limits treatment options and impairs improvement of patient survival. For example, approximately half of patients do not respond to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, although it is the standard of care for muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer. The development of robust predictive biomarkers is expected to improve outcomes by enabling clinicians to use chemotherapy only in the patients who will benefit from it. Recent advances in the molecular characterization of bladder cancer showed that the basal subtype of bladder cancer and tumors with inactivating mutations in DNA damage repair genes were associated with greater benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The present review summarizes current efforts to develop predictive biomarkers for drug response in bladder cancer, focusing on those that predict the response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer. We also review the current situation with regard to the identification of predictive biomarkers for response to intravesical therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecularly-targeted drugs. We also discuss the future applications of new technologies, including liquid biopsies and patient-derived organoids that will also serve as resources for the identification of biomarkers in bladder cancer.                © 2019 The Japanese Urological Association.	
30247985        	Human fetal adrenal cells retain age-related stem- and endocrine-differentiation potential in culture.            	The adrenal gland is a multiendocrine organ with a steroidogenic mesenchymal cortex and an inner catecholamine-producing medulla of neuroendocrine origin. After embryonic development, this plastic organ undergoes a functional postnatal remodeling. Elucidating these complex processes is pivotal for understanding the early bases of functional endocrine disorders and tumors affecting the mature gland. We developed an in vitro human adrenal cell model derived from fetal adrenal specimens at different gestational ages, consisting of neuroendocrine and cortical components and expressing the zona and functional markers of the original fetal organ. These cortical and neuroendocrine progenitor cells retain in vitro an intrinsic gestational-age-related differentiation and functional program. In vitro these cells spontaneously form 3-dimensional structure organoids with a structure similar to the fetal gland. The organoids show morphofunctional features and adrenal steroidogenic factor, steroid acute regulatory, cytochrome-P450-17A1, dosage-sensitive, sex-reversal, adrenal hypoplasia-critical region on chromosome X protein , NOTCH1, and nephroblastoma overexpressed/cysteine-rich protein 61/connective tissue growth factor/nephroblastoma overexpressed gene-3; stem (BMI1, nestin); and chromaffin (chromogranin A, tyrosine hydroxylase) markers similar to those of the populations of origin. This in vitro human adrenal system represents a unique but preliminar model for investigating the pathophysiological processes underlying physiologic adrenal remodeling and pathologic alterations involved in organ hypo- and hyperplasia and cancer.-Poli, G., Sarchielli, E., Guasti, D., Benvenuti, S., Ballerini, L., Mazzanti, B., Armignacco, R., Cantini, G., Lulli, M., Chortis, V., Arlt, W., Romagnoli, P., Vannelli, G.

32907944        	Human norovirus exhibits strain-specific sensitivity to host interferon pathways in human intestinal enteroids.            	Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide; yet currently, no vaccines or FDA-approved antiviral drugs are available to counter these pathogens. To understand HuNoV biology and the epithelial response to infection, we performed transcriptomic analyses, RT-qPCR, CRISPR-Cas9 modification of human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures, and functional studies with two virus strains (a pandemic GII.4 and a bile acid-dependent GII.3 strain). We identified a predominant type III interferon (IFN)-mediated innate response to HuNoV infection. Replication of both strains is sensitive to exogenous addition of IFNs, suggesting the potential of IFNs as therapeutics. To obtain insight into IFN pathway genes that play a role in the antiviral response to HuNoVs, we developed knockout (KO) HIE lines for IFN alpha and lambda receptors and the signaling molecules, MAVS, STAT1, and STAT2 An unexpected differential response of enhanced replication and virus spread was observed for GII.3, but not the globally dominant GII.4 HuNoV in STAT1-knockout HIEs compared to parental HIEs. These results indicate cellular IFN responses restrict GII.3 but not GII.4 replication. The strain-specific sensitivities of innate responses against HuNoV replication provide one explanation for why GII.4 infections are more widespread and highlight strain specificity as an important factor in HuNoV biology. Genetically modified HIEs for innate immune genes are useful tools for studying immune responses to viral or microbial pathogens.	
31419435        	Tumor Seeding During Colonoscopy as a Possible Cause for Metachronous Colorectal Cancer.            	In patients who have undergone surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC), 3% have recurrence of (metachronous) CRC. We investigated whether tumor seeding during colonoscopy (iatrogenic implantation of tumor cells in damaged mucosa) increases risk for metachronous CRC.                In a proof of principle study, we collected data from the Dutch National Pathology Registry for patients with a diagnosis of CRC from 2013 through 2015, with a second diagnosis of CRC within 6 months to 3.5 years after surgery. We reviewed pathology reports to identify likely metachronous CRC (histologically proven adenocarcinoma located elsewhere in the colon or rectum from the surgical anastomosis). For 22 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, we ascribed the most likely etiology to tumor seeding when endoscopic manipulations, such as biopsies or polypectomy, occurred at the location where the metachronous tumor was subsequently detected, after endoscopic manipulation of the primary tumor. We collected clinical data from patients and compared molecular profiles of the primary and metachronous colorectal tumors using next-generation sequencing. We then examined the source of seeded tumor. We tested whether tumor cells stay behind in the working channel of the endoscope after biopsies of colorectal tumors, and whether these cells maintain viability in organoid cultures.                In total, tumor seeding was suspected as the most likely etiology of metachronous CRC in 5 patients. Tumor tissues were available from 3 patients. An identical molecular signature was observed in the primary and metachronous colorectal tumors from all 3 patients. In 5 control cases with a different etiology of metachronous CRC, the molecular signature of the primary and metachronous tumor were completely different. Based on review of 2147 patient records, we estimated the risk of tumor seeding during colonoscopy to be 0.3%-0.6%. We demonstrated that the working channel of the colonoscope becomes contaminated with viable tumor cells during biopsy collection. Subsequent instruments introduced through this working channel also became contaminated. These cells were shown to maintain their proliferative potential.                In an analysis of primary and secondary tumors from patients with metachronous CRC, we found that primary tumor cells might be seeded in a new location after biopsy of the primary tumor. Although our study does not eliminate other possibilities of transmission, our findings and experiments support the hypothesis that tumor seeding can occur during colonoscopy via the working channel of the endoscope. The possibility of iatrogenic seeding seems low. However, our findings compel awareness on this potentially preventable cause of metachronous CRC.                Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

29555663        	Targeting Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) Family Proteins in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).            	Purpose: Persistent androgen receptor (AR) signaling drives castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and confers resistance to AR-targeting therapies. Novel therapeutic strategies to overcome this are urgently required. We evaluated how bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors (BETi) abrogate aberrant AR signaling in CRPC.Experimental Design: We determined associations between BET expression, AR-driven transcription, and patient outcome; and the effect and mechanism by which chemical BETi (JQ1 and GSK1210151A; I-BET151) and BET family protein knockdown regulates AR-V7 expression and AR signaling in prostate cancer models.Results: Nuclear BRD4 protein expression increases significantly (P ≤ 0.01) with castration resistance in same patient treatment-naïve (median H-score; interquartile range: 100; 100-170) and CRPC (150; 110-200) biopsies, with higher expression at diagnosis associating with worse outcome (HR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.50-7.01; P ≤ 0.001). BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 RNA expression in CRPC biopsies correlates with AR-driven transcription (all P ≤ 0.001). Chemical BETi, and combined BET family protein knockdown, reduce AR-V7 expression and AR signaling. This was not recapitulated by C-MYC knockdown. In addition, we show that BETi regulates RNA processing thereby reducing alternative splicing and AR-V7 expression. Furthermore, BETi reduce growth of prostate cancer cells and patient-derived organoids with known AR mutations, AR amplification and AR-V7 expression. Finally, BETi, unlike enzalutamide, decreases persistent AR signaling and growth (P ≤ 0.001) of a patient-derived xenograft model of CRPC with AR amplification and AR-V7 expression.Conclusions: BETi merit clinical evaluation as inhibitors of AR splicing and function, with trials demonstrating their blockade in proof-of-mechanism pharmacodynamic studies.

31902168        	[Practice and challenge of precision medicine for pancreatic cancer].            	Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal malignancy with an overall 5-year survival rate less than 9%, mainly due to late diagnosis and lack of effective therapeutic options.In the last decade, post-operative survival has been enhanced with advent of neoadjuvant therapy and combined adjuvant therapy.Furthermore, the information gained from the omics data, including next generation sequencing data, hasn't yet begun to affect treatment of pancreatic cancer patients.However, in terms of precision medicine, pancreatic cancer has always lagged behind other tumors.Therefore, combined with practical experience, summary of the latest development and research progress of precise medical treatment of pancreatic cancer, especially from the fields of molecular biology and experimental models, is of critical importance. Further development of precise medicine for pancreatic cancer based on platforms using PDX and organoid model would promisingly help in effective improvement of clinical treatment.	
33664379        	Heterozygous APC germline mutations impart predisposition to colorectal cancer.            	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited syndrome caused by a heterozygous adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) germline mutation, associated with a profound lifetime risk for colorectal cancer. While it is well accepted that tumorigenic transformation is initiated following acquisition of a second mutation and loss of function of the APC gene, the role of heterozygous APC mutation in this process is yet to be discovered. This work aimed to explore whether a heterozygous APC mutation induces molecular defects underlying tumorigenic transformation and how different APC germline mutations predict disease severity. Three FAP-human embryonic stem cell lines (FAP1/2/3-hESC lines) carrying germline mutations at different locations of the APC gene, and two control hESC lines free of the APC mutation, were differentiated into colon organoids and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing. In addition, data regarding the genotype and clinical phenotype of the embryo donor parents were collected from medical records. FAP-hESCs carrying a complete loss-of-function of a single APC allele (FAP3) generated complex and molecularly mature colon organoids, which were similar to controls. In contrast, FAP-hESCs carrying APC truncation mutations (FAP1 and FAP2) generated only few cyst-like structures and cell aggregates of various shape, occasionally with luminal parts, which aligned with their failure to upregulate critical differentiation genes early in the process, as shown by RNA sequencing. Abnormal disease phenotype was shown also in non-pathological colon of FAP patients by the randomly distribution of proliferating cells throughout the crypts, compared to their focused localization in the lower part of the crypt in healthy/non-FAP patients. Genotype/phenotype analysis revealed correlations between the colon organoid maturation potential and FAP severity in the carrier parents. In conclusion, this study suggest that a single truncated APC allele is sufficient to initiate early molecular tumorigenic activity. In addition, the results hint that patient-specific hESC-derived colon organoids can probably predict disease severity among FAP patients.	
32726135        	EpCAM+CD73+ mark epithelial progenitor cells in postnatal human lung and are associated with pathogenesis of pulmonary disease including lung adenocarcinoma.            	Lung injury in mice induces mobilization of discrete subsets of epithelial progenitor cells to promote new airway and alveolar structures. However, whether similar cell types exist in human lung remains unresolved. Using flow cytometry, we identified a distinct cluster of cells expressing the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a cell surface marker expressed on epithelial progenitor cells, enriched in the ecto-5'-nucleotidase CD73 in unaffected postnatal human lungs resected from pediatric patients with congenital lung lesions. Within the EpCAM+CD73+ population, a small subset coexpresses integrin β4 and HTII-280. This population remained stable with age. Spatially, EpCAM+CD73+ cells were positioned along the basal membrane of respiratory epithelium and alveolus next to CD73+ cells lacking EpCAM. Expanded EpCAM+CD73+ cells give rise to a pseudostratified epithelium in a two-dimensional air-liquid interface or a clonal three-dimensional organoid assay. Organoids generated under alveolar differentiation conditions were cystic-like and lacked robust alveolar mature cell types. Compared with unaffected postnatal lung, congenital lung lesions were marked by clusters of EpCAM+CD73+ cells in airway and cystic distal lung structures lined by simple epithelium composed of EpCAM+SCGB1A1+ cells and hyperplastic EpCAM+proSPC+ cells. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there was a marked increase in EpCAM+CD73+ tumor cells enriched in inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules CD47 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which was associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In conclusion, EpCAM+CD73+ cells are rare novel epithelial progenitor cells in the human lung. Importantly, reemergence of CD73 in lung adenocarcinoma enriched in negative immune checkpoint molecules may serve as a novel therapeutic target.	
33525777        	Organoids, organs-on-chips and other systems, and microbiota.            	The human gut microbiome is considered an organ in its entirety and has been the subject of extensive research due to its role in physiology, metabolism, digestion, and immune regulation. Disequilibria of the normal microbiome have been associated with the development of several gastrointestinal diseases, but the exact underlying interactions are not well understood. Conventional in vivo and in vitro modelling systems fail to faithfully recapitulate the complexity of the human host-gut microbiome, emphasising the requirement for novel systems that provide a platform to study human host-gut microbiome interactions with a more holistic representation of the human in vivo microenvironment. In this review, we outline the progression and applications of new and old modelling systems with particular focus on their ability to model and to study host-microbiome cross-talk.                © 2017 The Author(s).	
31497199        	Inhibition of SIRT1 promotes taste bud stem cell survival and mitigates radiation-induced oral mucositis in mice.            	Taste loss is one of the debilitating complications in radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM), as occurs in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. We report here a radio-mitigation effect of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) inhibitors in taste bud organoids and a mouse model of radiation-induced taste bud injury. The organoids, developed from circumvallate (CV) papilla, were irradiated with single dose of X-rays and inhibitors of SIRT1 or SIRT2 were added 24 h later. The survival was evaluated by measuring the number and size of regenerated organoids after irradiation (IR). Oral mucositis (OM) was induced by IR of the oral region of Lgr5-lacZ transgenic mice. The surviving Lgr5+ taste bud stem cells were identified after lacZ-staining and the mucosal ulceration on tongue dorsal surface was determined by histological methods. Results showed that SIRT1 inhibitors (nicotinamide, EX527, salermide and sirtinol), but not SIRT2 inhibitors, significantly improve taste bud organoid survival after IR. Remarkably, administration of nicotinamide (NAM), a recognized inhibitor of SIRT1 to mice 24 h after IR promotes the survival of Lgr5+ taste bud stem cells, resulting in alleviated tongue mucositis. In conclusion, SIRT1 inhibitors promote Lgr5+ taste bud stem cell survival and mitigate RIOM in mice. These observations have important implications for efforts to develop therapeutic strategies against taste dysfunction and mucosal ulceration in RIOM.	
28886383        	Anatomically and Functionally Distinct Lung Mesenchymal Populations Marked by Lgr5 and Lgr6.            	The diversity of mesenchymal cell types in the lung that influence epithelial homeostasis and regeneration is poorly defined. We used genetic lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and organoid culture approaches to show that Lgr5 and Lgr6, well-known markers of stem cells in epithelial tissues, are markers of mesenchymal cells in the adult lung. Lgr6+ cells comprise a subpopulation of smooth muscle cells surrounding airway epithelia and promote airway differentiation of epithelial progenitors via Wnt-Fgf10 cooperation. Genetic ablation of Lgr6+ cells impairs airway injury repair in vivo. Distinct Lgr5+ cells are located in alveolar compartments and are sufficient to promote alveolar differentiation of epithelial progenitors through Wnt activation. Modulating Wnt activity altered differentiation outcomes specified by mesenchymal cells. This identification of region- and lineage-specific crosstalk between epithelium and their neighboring mesenchymal partners provides new understanding of how different cell types are maintained in the adult lung.

33495575        	Forkhead box F1 induces columnar phenotype and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in esophageal squamous cells to initiate Barrett's like metaplasia.            	Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked Forkhead Box F1 (FOXF1) to Barrett's esophagus (BE). Understanding whether FOXF1 is involved in initiation of Barrett's metaplasia could allow FOXF1 to be used for risk stratification and for therapy. Two-dimensional cell cultures and three-dimensional organoid cultures and well-annotated human biopsies were used to determine the role of FOXF1 in BE pathogenesis. Multiple established esophageal squamous and BE cell lines were tested in gain- and loss-of-function studies. Initiation of a BE-like metaplastic change was evaluated by measuring characteristic cytokeratins and global gene expression profiling and by culturing organoids. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was evaluated by immunostaining for E-cadherin, vimentin and Snail, and by cell motility assay. Columnar esophageal epithelium of BE patients exhibited higher expression of FOXF1 compared to normal squamous esophageal epithelium of GERD patients (P < 0.001). Acidic bile salts induced nuclear FOXF1 in esophageal squamous cells. FOXF1 overexpression in normal esophageal squamous cells: (a) increased columnar cytokeratins and decreased squamous cytokeratins, (b) converted squamous organoids to glandular organoids, and (c) switched global gene profiles to resemble that of human BE epithelium (P = 2.1685e - 06 for upregulated genes and P = 8.3378e - 09 for downregulated genes). FOXF1 inhibition in BE cell lines led to loss of BE differentiation markers, CK7, and mucin 2. Also, FOXF1 induced EMT and promoted cell motility in normal esophageal squamous epithelial cells. FOXF1-induced genes mapped to pathways such as Cancer, Cellular Assembly and Organization, DNA Replication, Recombination, and Repair. In conclusion, FOXF1 promotes a BE-like columnar phenotype and cell motility in esophageal squamous epithelial cells, which may have a critical role in BE development. FOXF1 should be studied further as a biomarker for BE and as a target for BE treatment.	
32900774        	YAP and AP-1 Cooperate to Initiate Pancreatic Cancer Development from Ductal Cells in Mice.            	The development of pancreatic cancer is heavily dependent upon the aberrant activation of KRAS signaling. Among the downstream targets of KRAS, the effectors of the Hippo pathway YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ) are crucial during cancer initiation and progression. However, little is known about the cell type-specific effects of YAP/TAZ on the development of pancreatic cancer. Here we clarify the unique consequences of YAP/TAZ activation in the ductal cell population of the pancreas by generating mice with pancreatic duct cell-specific, inducible knockouts of Lats1 and Lats2, the main kinases upstream of YAP/TAZ. Oncogenic activation of YAP by deletion of Lats1/2 in ductal cells led to the rapid transformation of the pancreas, which was accompanied by a robust increase in the expression of YAP and AP-1 target genes. Pharmacologic inhibition of AP-1 activity induced death in Lats1/2 knockout organoids and attenuated YAP-dependent transformation of the pancreas in vivo. Both YAP and AP-1 were activated during the development of KRAS-dependent cancer in mice and human patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting that this signaling hub represents an important mediator of pancreatic cancer development and progression. Collectively, these data define a YAP-dependent mechanism of pancreatic cancer cell development and suggest that inhibition of AP-1 can suppress this development. SIGNIFICANCE: A pancreatic ductal cell-specific knockout mouse model featuring constitutively active YAP allows for the study of YAP-dependent transformation of the pancreas and for screening pharmacologically active inhibitors.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32079653        	Estrogen-related receptors are targetable ROS sensors.            	Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause oxidative stress and consequently cell injury contributing to a wide range of diseases. Addressing the critical gaps in our understanding of the adaptive molecular events downstream ROS provocation holds promise for the identification of druggable metabolic vulnerabilities. Here, we unveil a direct molecular link between the activity of two estrogen-related receptor (ERR) isoforms and the control of glutamine utilization and glutathione antioxidant production. ERRα down-regulation restricts glutamine entry into the TCA cycle, while ERRγ up-regulation promotes glutamine-driven glutathione production. Notably, we identify increased ERRγ expression/activation as a hallmark of oxidative stress triggered by mitochondrial disruption or chemotherapy. Enhanced tumor antioxidant capacity is an underlying feature of human breast cancer (BCa) patients that respond poorly to treatment. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of ERRγ with the selective inverse agonist GSK5182 increases antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel on poor outcome BCa tumor organoids. Our findings thus underscore the ERRs as novel redox sensors and effectors of a ROS defense program and highlight the potential therapeutic advantage of exploiting ERRγ inhibitors for the treatment of BCa and other diseases where oxidative stress plays a central role.                © 2020 Vernier et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
31365870        	NOX1-Dependent mTORC1 Activation via S100A9 Oxidation in Cancer Stem-like Cells Leads to Colon Cancer Progression.            	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated with the refractory nature of cancer, and elucidating the targetable pathways for CSCs is crucial for devising innovative antitumor therapies. We find that the proliferation of CSC-enriched colon spheroids from clinical specimen is dependent on mTORC1 kinase, which is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NOX1, an NADPH oxidase. In the spheroid-derived xenograft tumors, NOX1 is preferentially expressed in LGR5-positive cells. Dependence on NOX1 expression or mTOR kinase activity is corroborated in the xenograft tumors and mouse colon cancer-derived organoids. NOX1 co-localizes with mTORC1 in VPS41-/VPS39-positive lysosomes, where mTORC1 binds to S100A9, a member of S100 calcium binding proteins, in a NOX1-produced ROS-dependent manner. S100A9 is oxidized by NOX1-produced ROS, which facilitates binding to mTORC1 and its activation. We propose that NOX1-dependent mTORC1 activation via S100A9 oxidation in VPS41-/VPS39-positive lysosomes is crucial for colon CSC proliferation and colon cancer progression.

30616752        	Rapid Research Autopsy: Piecing the Puzzle of Tumor Heterogeneity.            	Tumor heterogeneity decreases the effectiveness of anticancer therapies and is an important topic in translational cancer research, given its relevance in clinical oncology. Here, we discuss how rapid research autopsy of cancer patients can elucidate heterogeneity-associated processes including cancer evolution and acquired therapeutic resistance. In practice, rapid research autopsy is performed shortly after a patient's passing to procure multiple metastatic tumor samples for genomic studies through next-generation sequencing and development of patient-derived xenografts or organoids. Mechanistic insights gained from research autopsy studies of cancer patients can help identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. Finally, the success of research autopsy programs is bolstered by collaboration across different medical and scientific disciplines in addition to support from patients and families.

32223302        	Human intestinal enteroids as a model of Clostridioides difficile-induced enteritis.            	Clostridioides difficile is an important nosocomial pathogen that produces toxins to cause life-threatening diarrhea and colitis. Toxins bind to epithelial receptors and promote the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton. C. difficile toxin activity is commonly studied in cancer-derived and immortalized cell lines. However, the biological relevance of these models is limited. Moreover, no model is available for examining C. difficile-induced enteritis, an understudied health problem. We hypothesized that human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) express toxin receptors and provide a new model to dissect C. difficile cytotoxicity in the small intestine. We generated biopsy-derived jejunal HIE and Vero cells, which stably express LifeAct-Ruby, a fluorescent label of F-actin, to monitor actin cytoskeleton rearrangement by live-cell microscopy. Imaging analysis revealed that toxins from pathogenic C. difficile strains elicited cell rounding in a strain-dependent manner, and HIEs were tenfold more sensitive to toxin A (TcdA) than toxin B (TcdB). By quantitative PCR, we paradoxically found that HIEs expressed greater quantities of toxin receptor mRNA and yet exhibited decreased sensitivity to toxins when compared with traditionally used cell lines. We reasoned that these differences may be explained by components, such as mucins, that are present in HIEs cultures, that are absent in immortalized cell lines. Addition of human-derived mucin 2 (MUC2) to Vero cells delayed cell rounding, indicating that mucus serves as a barrier to toxin-receptor binding. This work highlights that investigation of C. difficile infection in that HIEs can provide important insights into the intricate interactions between toxins and the human intestinal epithelium.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this article, we developed a novel model of Clostridioides difficile-induced enteritis using jejunal-derived human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) transduced with fluorescently tagged F-actin. Using live-imaging, we identified that jejunal HIEs express high levels of TcdA and CDT receptors, are more sensitive to TcdA than TcdB, and secrete mucus, which delays toxin-epithelial interactions. This work also optimizes optically clear C. difficile-conditioned media suitable for live-cell imaging.	
28469183        	Coaxial 3D bioprinting of self-assembled multicellular heterogeneous tumor fibers.            	Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of living structures with cell-laden biomaterials has been achieved in vitro, however, some cell-cell interactions are limited by the existing hydrogel. To better mimic tumor microenvironment, self-assembled multicellular heterogeneous brain tumor fibers have been fabricated by a custom-made coaxial extrusion 3D bioprinting system, with high viability, proliferative activity and efficient tumor-stromal interactions. Therein, in order to further verify the sufficient interactions between tumor cells and stroma MSCs, CRE-LOXP switch gene system which contained GSCs transfected with "LOXP-STOP-LOXP-RFP" genes and MSCs transfected with "CRE recombinase" gene was used. Results showed that tumor-stroma cells interacted with each other and fused, the transcription of RFP was higher than that of 2D culture model and control group with cells mixed directly into alginate, respectively. RFP expression was observed only in the cell fibers but not in the control group under confocal microscope. In conclusion, coaxial 3D bioprinted multicellular self-assembled heterogeneous tumor tissue-like fibers provided preferable 3D models for studying tumor microenvironment in vitro, especially for tumor-stromal interactions.	
29903910        	Aberrant endocytosis leads to the loss of normal mitotic spindle orientation during epithelial glandular morphogenesis.            	Epithelial cells form tissues with many functions, including secretion and environmental separation and protection. Glandular epithelial tissues comprise cysts and tubules that are formed from a polarized, single-epithelial cell layer surrounding a central, fluid-filled lumen. The pathways regulating key processes in epithelial tissue morphogenesis such as mitotic spindle formation are incompletely understood, but are important to investigate, as their dysregulation is a signature of epithelial tumors. Here, we describe a signaling axis that manifests in a defect in mitotic spindle orientation during epithelial growth and cystogenesis. We found that activation of the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) results in the sustained internalization of cell-surface components such as the cMet receptor and the cell-adhesion molecule E-cadherin. The spindle orientation defect arising from elevated levels of ARF6-GTP required an increase in cMet endocytosis, but was independent of E-cadherin internalization or elevated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity resulting from internalized receptor signaling on endosomes. Misorientation of the mitotic spindle resulted in the development of epithelial cysts with structural abnormalities, the most conspicuous of which was the presence of multiple intercellular lumens. Abnormal mitotic spindle orientation was necessary but insufficient to disrupt glandular development, as blocking the strong prosurvival signal resulting from ERK hyperactivation yielded structurally normal cysts despite continued manifestation of spindle orientation defects. Our findings highlight a previously unknown link between ARF6 activation, cMet receptor internalization, and mitotic spindle orientation during epithelial glandular morphogenesis.                © 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.	
31775037        	Differential Functions of Splicing Factors in Mammary Transformation and Breast Cancer Metastasis.            	Misregulation of alternative splicing is a hallmark of human tumors, yet to what extent and how it contributes to malignancy are only beginning to be unraveled. Here, we define which members of the splicing factor SR and SR-like families contribute to breast cancer and uncover differences and redundancies in their targets and biological functions. We identify splicing factors frequently altered in human breast tumors and assay their oncogenic functions using breast organoid models. We demonstrate that not all splicing factors affect mammary tumorigenesis in MCF-10A cells. Specifically, the upregulation of SRSF4, SRSF6, or TRA2β disrupts acinar morphogenesis and promotes cell proliferation and invasion in MCF-10A cells. By characterizing the targets of these oncogenic splicing factors, we identify shared spliced isoforms associated with well-established cancer hallmarks. Finally, we demonstrate that TRA2β is regulated by the MYC oncogene, plays a role in metastasis maintenance in vivo, and its levels correlate with breast cancer patient survival.

27187615        	ERK5 signalling rescues intestinal epithelial turnover and tumour cell proliferation upon ERK1/2 abrogation.            	The ERK1/2 MAPK signalling module integrates extracellular cues that induce proliferation and differentiation of epithelial lineages, and is an established oncogenic driver, particularly in the intestine. However, the interrelation of the ERK1/2 module relative to other signalling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells and colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear. Here we show that loss of Erk1/2 in intestinal epithelial cells results in defects in nutrient absorption, epithelial cell migration and secretory cell differentiation. However, intestinal epithelial cell proliferation is not impeded, implying compensatory mechanisms. Genetic deletion of Erk1/2 or pharmacological targeting of MEK1/2 results in supraphysiological activity of the ERK5 pathway. Furthermore, targeting both pathways causes a more effective suppression of cell proliferation in murine intestinal organoids and human CRC lines. These results suggest that ERK5 provides a common bypass route in intestinal epithelial cells, which rescues cell proliferation upon abrogation of ERK1/2 signalling, with therapeutic implications in CRC.	
30154153        	Transcription Factor PROX1 Suppresses Notch Pathway Activation via the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex in Colorectal Cancer Stem-like Cells.            	The homeobox transcription factor PROX1 is induced by high Wnt/β-catenin activity in intestinal adenomas and colorectal cancer, where it promotes tumor progression. Here we report that in LGR5+ colorectal cancer cells, PROX1 suppresses the Notch pathway, which is essential for cell fate in intestinal stem cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of Notch in ex vivo 3D organoid cultures from transgenic mouse intestinal adenoma models increased Prox1 expression and the number of PROX1-positive cells. Notch inhibition led to increased proliferation of the PROX1-positive colorectal cancer cells, but did not affect their ability to give rise to PROX1-negative secretory cells. Conversely, PROX1 deletion increased Notch target gene expression and NOTCH1 promoter activity, indicating reciprocal regulation between PROX1 and the Notch pathway in colorectal cancer. PROX1 interacted with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex to suppress the Notch pathway. Thus, our data suggests that PROX1 and Notch suppress each other and that PROX1-mediated suppression of Notch mediates its stem cell function in colorectal cancer.Significance: These findings address the role of the PROX1 homeobox factor as a downstream effector of Wnt/β-catenin singling in colorectal cancer stem cells and show that PROX1 inhibits the Notch pathway and helps to enforce the stem cell phenotype and inhibit differentiation.

22895187        	Tumour suppressor RNF43 is a stem-cell E3 ligase that induces endocytosis of Wnt receptors.            	LGR5+ stem cells reside at crypt bottoms, intermingled with Paneth cells that provide Wnt, Notch and epidermal growth factor signals. Here we find that the related RNF43 and ZNRF3 transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases are uniquely expressed in LGR5+ stem cells. Simultaneous deletion of the two genes encoding these proteins in the intestinal epithelium of mice induces rapidly growing adenomas containing high numbers of Paneth and LGR5+ stem cells. In vitro, growth of organoids derived from these adenomas is arrested when Wnt secretion is inhibited, indicating a dependence of the adenoma stem cells on Wnt produced by adenoma Paneth cells. In the HEK293T human cancer cell line, expression of RNF43 blocks Wnt responses and targets surface-expressed frizzled receptors to lysosomes. In the RNF43-mutant colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, reconstitution of RNF43 expression removes its response to exogenous Wnt. We conclude that RNF43 and ZNRF3 reduce Wnt signals by selectively ubiquitinating frizzled receptors, thereby targeting these Wnt receptors for degradation.

28195397        	Alcohol Injury Damages Intestinal Stem Cells.            	Alcohol consumption is associated with intestinal injury including intestinal leakiness and the risk of developing progressive gastrointestinal cancer. Alcoholics have disruption of intestinal barrier dysfunction that persists weeks after stopping alcohol intake, and this occurs in spite of the fact that intestinal epithelial cells turn over every 3 to 5 days. The renewal and functional regulation of the intestinal epithelium largely relies on intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Chronic inflammation and tissue damage in the intestine can injure stem cells including accumulation of mutations that may result in ISC dysfunction and transformation. ISCs are a key element in intestinal function and pathology; however, very little is known about the effects of alcohol on ISCs. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ISCs is one mechanism by which alcohol induces long-lasting intestinal damage.                In Vivo: Small intestinal samples from alcohol- and control-fed mice were assessed for ISC markers (Lgr5 and Bmi1) and the changes of the β-catenin signaling using immunofluorescent microscopy, Western blotting, and RT-PCR. Ex Vivo: Organoids were generated from small intestine tissue and subsequently exposed to alcohol and analyzed for ISC markers, β-catenin signaling.                Chronic alcohol consumption significantly decreased the expression of stem cell markers, Bmi1 in the small intestine of the alcohol-fed mice and also resulted in dysregulation of the β-catenin signaling-an essential regulator of its target gene Lgr5 and ISC function. Exposure of small intestine-derived organoids to 0.2% alcohol significantly reduced the growth of the organoids, including budding, and total surface area of the organoid cultures. Alcohol also significantly decreased the expression of Lgr5, p-β-catenin (ser552), and Bmi1 in the organoid model.                Both chronic alcohol feeding and acute exposure of alcohol resulted in ISC dysregulation which might be one mechanism for alcohol-induced long-lasting intestinal damage.

30392957        	T Helper Cell Cytokines Modulate Intestinal Stem Cell Renewal and Differentiation.            	In the small intestine, a niche of accessory cell types supports the generation of mature epithelial cell types from intestinal stem cells (ISCs). It is unclear, however, if and how immune cells in the niche affect ISC fate or the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify MHC class II (MHCII) machinery enrichment in two subsets of Lgr5+ ISCs. We show that MHCII+ Lgr5+ ISCs are non-conventional antigen-presenting cells in co-cultures with CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. Stimulation of intestinal organoids with key Th cytokines affects Lgr5+ ISC renewal and differentiation in opposing ways: pro-inflammatory signals promote differentiation, while regulatory cells and cytokines reduce it. In vivo genetic perturbation of Th cells or MHCII expression on Lgr5+ ISCs impacts epithelial cell differentiation and IEC fate during infection. These interactions between Th cells and Lgr5+ ISCs, thus, orchestrate tissue-wide responses to external signals.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
23975432        	The role of KCNQ1 in mouse and human gastrointestinal cancers.            	Kcnq1, which encodes for the pore-forming α-subunit of a voltage-gated potassium channel, was identified as a gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancer susceptibility gene in multiple Sleeping Beauty DNA transposon-based forward genetic screens in mice. To confirm that Kcnq1 has a functional role in GI tract cancer, we created Apc(Min) mice that carried a targeted deletion mutation in Kcnq1. Results demonstrated that Kcnq1 is a tumor suppressor gene as Kcnq1 mutant mice developed significantly more intestinal tumors, especially in the proximal small intestine and colon, and some of these tumors progressed to become aggressive adenocarcinomas. Gross tissue abnormalities were also observed in the rectum, pancreas and stomach. Colon organoid formation was significantly increased in organoids created from Kcnq1 mutant mice compared with wild-type littermate controls, suggesting a role for Kcnq1 in the regulation of the intestinal crypt stem cell compartment. To identify gene expression changes due to loss of Kcnq1, we carried out microarray studies in the colon and proximal small intestine. We identified altered genes involved in innate immune responses, goblet and Paneth cell function, ion channels, intestinal stem cells, epidermal growth factor receptor and other growth regulatory signaling pathways. We also found genes implicated in inflammation and in cellular detoxification. Pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis confirmed the importance of these gene clusters and further identified significant overlap with genes regulated by MUC2 and CFTR, two important regulators of intestinal homeostasis. To investigate the role of KCNQ1 in human colorectal cancer (CRC), we measured protein levels of KCNQ1 by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing samples from CRC patients with liver metastases who had undergone hepatic resection. Results showed that low expression of KCNQ1 expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival.	
28137882        	E3 ubiquitin ligase Mule targets β-catenin under conditions of hyperactive Wnt signaling.            	Wnt signaling, named after the secreted proteins that bind to cell surface receptors to activate the pathway, plays critical roles both in embryonic development and the maintenance of homeostasis in many adult tissues. Two particularly important cellular programs orchestrated by Wnt signaling are proliferation and stem cell self-renewal. Constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway resulting from mutation or improper modulation of pathway components contributes to cancer development in various tissues. Colon cancers frequently bear inactivating mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, whose product is an important component of the destruction complex that regulates β-catenin levels. Stabilization and nuclear localization of β-catenin result in the expression of a panel of Wnt target genes. We previously showed that Mule/Huwe1/Arf-BP1 (Mule) controls murine intestinal stem and progenitor cell proliferation by modulating the Wnt pathway via c-Myc. Here we extend our investigation of Mule's influence on oncogenesis by showing that Mule interacts directly with β-catenin and targets it for degradation under conditions of hyperactive Wnt signaling. Our findings suggest that Mule uses various mechanisms to fine-tune the Wnt pathway and provides multiple safeguards against tumorigenesis.	
33500395        	The androgen receptor/filamin A complex as a target in prostate cancer microenvironment.            	Prostate cancer represents the major cause of cancer-related death in men and patients frequently develop drug-resistance and metastatic disease. Most studies focus on hormone-resistance mechanisms related to androgen receptor mutations or to the acquired property of prostate cancer cells to over-activate signaling pathways. Tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in prostate cancer progression. However, the mechanism involving androgen/androgen receptor signaling in cancer associated fibroblasts and consequences for prostate cancer progression still remains elusive. We now report that prostate cancer associated fibroblasts express a transcriptional-incompetent androgen receptor. Upon androgen challenging, the receptor co-localizes with the scaffold protein filamin A in the extra-nuclear compartment of fibroblasts, thus mediating their migration and invasiveness. Cancer-associated fibroblasts move towards epithelial prostate cancer cells in 2D and 3D cultures, thereby inducing an increase of the prostate cancer organoid size. Androgen enhances both these effects through androgen receptor/filamin A complex assembly in cancer-associated fibroblasts. An androgen receptor-derived stapled peptide, which disrupts the androgen receptor/filamin A complex assembly, abolishes the androgen-dependent migration and invasiveness of cancer associated fibroblasts. Notably, the peptide impairs the androgen-induced invasiveness of CAFs in 2D models and reduces the overall tumor area in androgen-treated 3D co-culture. The androgen receptor in association with β1 integrin and membrane type-matrix metalloproteinase 1 activates a protease cascade triggering extracellular matrix remodeling. The peptide also impairs the androgen activation of this cascade. This study offers a potential new marker, the androgen receptor/filamin A complex, and a new therapeutic approach targeting intracellular pathways activated by the androgen/androgen receptor axis in prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts. Such a strategy, alone or in combination with conventional therapies, may allow a more efficient treatment of prostate cancer.	
33391976        	Multifunctional microfluidic chip for cancer diagnosis and treatment.            	Microfluidic chip is not a chip in the traditional sense. It is technologies that control fluids at the micro level. As a burgeoning biochip, microfluidic chips integrate multiple disciplines, including physiology, pathology, cell biology, biophysics, engineering mechanics, mechanical design, materials science, and so on. The application of microfluidic chip has shown tremendous promise in the field of cancer therapy in the past three decades. Various types of cell and tissue cultures, including 2D cell culture, 3D cell culture and tissue organoid culture could be performed on microfluidic chips. Patient-derived cancer cells and tissues can be cultured on microfluidic chips in a visible, controllable, and high-throughput manner, which greatly advances the process of personalized medicine. Moreover, the functionality of microfluidic chip is greatly expanding due to the customizable nature. In this review, we introduce its application in developing cancer preclinical models, detecting cancer biomarkers, screening anti-cancer drugs, exploring tumor heterogeneity and producing nano-drugs. We highlight the functions and recent development of microfluidic chip to provide references for advancing cancer diagnosis and treatment.                © The author(s).	
28947532        	Epithelial vimentin plays a functional role in mammary gland development.            	In the mammary gland, vimentin intermediate filaments are expressed in stromal cells and in basal epithelial cell populations, including gland-reconstituting mammary stem cells, with largely undefined functions. Here, we have studied how vimentin deficiency affects mouse mammary gland development. We find that, in adult vimentin knockout mice (Vim-/- ), mammary ductal outgrowth is delayed. The adult Vim-/- glands display dilated ducts and a reduced basal-to-luminal mouse mammary epithelial cell (MMEC) ratio indicative of altered progenitor cell activity. Accordingly, isolated Vim-/- MMECs form fewer mammospheres and basal-like organoids in vitro than their wild-type counterparts. Importantly, reduced basal MMEC number translates into defects in Vim-/- mammary gland regeneration in vivo Global gene expression profiling of basal MMECs reveals that lack of vimentin alters multiple pathways, including adhesion, cancer and Wnt signalling. Furthermore, vimentin contributes to stem-like cell properties in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, wherein vimentin depletion reduces tumoursphere formation and attenuates expression of breast cancer stem cell-associated surface markers. Together, our findings identify vimentin as a positive regulator of stemness in the developing mouse mammary gland and in breast cancer cells.                © 2017.

31548432        	Aldh1b1 expression defines progenitor cells in the adult pancreas and is required for Kras-induced pancreatic cancer.            	The presence of progenitor or stem cells in the adult pancreas and their potential involvement in homeostasis and cancer development remain unresolved issues. Here, we show that mouse centroacinar cells can be identified and isolated by virtue of the mitochondrial enzyme Aldh1b1 that they uniquely express. These cells are necessary and sufficient for the formation of self-renewing adult pancreatic organoids in an Aldh1b1-dependent manner. Aldh1b1-expressing centroacinar cells are largely quiescent, self-renew, and, as shown by genetic lineage tracing, contribute to all 3 pancreatic lineages in the adult organ under homeostatic conditions. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of these cells identified a progenitor cell population, established its molecular signature, and determined distinct differentiation pathways to early progenitors. A distinct feature of these progenitor cells is the preferential expression of small GTPases, including Kras, suggesting that they might be susceptible to Kras-driven oncogenic transformation. This finding and the overexpression of Aldh1b1 in human and mouse pancreatic cancers, driven by activated Kras, prompted us to examine the involvement of Aldh1b1 in oncogenesis. We demonstrated genetically that ablation of Aldh1b1 completely abrogates tumor development in a mouse model of KrasG12D-induced pancreatic cancer.	
26609108        	Differential Regulation of ZEB1 and EMT by MAPK-Interacting Protein Kinases (MNK) and eIF4E in Pancreatic Cancer.            	Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors are associated with dysregulation of mRNA translation. In this report, it is demonstrated that PDAC cells grown in collagen exhibit increased activation of the MAPK-interacting protein kinases (MNK) that mediate eIF4E phosphorylation. Pharmacologic and genetic targeting of MNKs reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), decrease cell migration, and reduce protein expression of the EMT-regulator ZEB1 without affecting ZEB1 mRNA levels. Paradoxically, targeting eIF4E, the best-characterized effector of MNKs, increases ZEB1 mRNA expression through repression of ZEB1-targeting miRNAs, miR-200c and miR-141. In contrast, targeting the MNK effector hnRNPA1, which can function as a translational repressor, increases ZEB1 protein without increasing ZEB1 mRNA levels. Importantly, treatment with MNK inhibitors blocks growth of chemoresistant PDAC cells in collagen and decreases the number of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity-positive (Aldefluor+) cells. Significantly, MNK inhibitors increase E-cadherin mRNA levels and decrease vimentin mRNA levels in human PDAC organoids without affecting ZEB1 mRNA levels. Importantly, MNK inhibitors also decrease growth of human PDAC organoids.                These results demonstrate differential regulation of ZEB1 and EMT by MNKs and eIF4E, and identify MNKs as potential targets in pancreatic cancer.                ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30024920        	Modeling APC mutagenesis and familial adenomatous polyposis using human iPS cells.            	Mutations in the gene Adenomatous Polyposis Coli or APC appear in most sporadic cases of colorectal cancer and it is the most frequent mutation causing hereditary Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. The detailed molecular mechanism by which APC mutations predispose to the development of colorectal cancer is not completely understood. This is in part due to the lack of accessibility to appropriate models that recapitulate the early events associated with APC mediated intestinal transformation. We have established a novel platform utilizing human induced Pluripotent Stem cells or iPSC from normal or FAP-specific APC mutant individuals and evaluated the effect of the mutation in the cells before and after differentiation into intestinal organoids. In order to minimize genetic background effects, we also established an isogenic platform using TALEN-mediated gene editing. Comparison of normal and APC mutant iPSC revealed a significant defect in cell identity and polarity due to the presence of APC in heterozygosity as well as chromosomal aberrations including abnormal anaphases and centrosome numbers. Importantly, upon specification into intestinal progeny, APC heterozygosity was responsible for a major change in the transcriptional identity of the cells with dysregulation of key signaling pathways, including metabolic reprogramming, abnormal lipid metabolism and intestinal-specific cadherin expression. In conclusion, we have developed a novel iPSC/intestinal model of APC mutagenesis and provide strong evidence that APC in heterozygosity imparts a clear phenotypic and molecular defect, affecting basic cellular functions and integrity, providing novel insights in the earlier events of APC-mediated tumorigenesis.	
32973331        	Inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F suppresses Wnt signaling in colorectal cancer.            	Wnt signaling dysregulation promotes tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated the role of PTPRF, a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase, in regulating Wnt signaling in CRC. Knockdown of PTPRF decreased cell proliferation in patient-derived primary colon cancer cells and established CRC cell lines. In addition, the rate of proliferation as well as colony formation ability were significantly decreased in tumor organoids grown in 3D, whereas the number of differentiated tumor organoids were markedly increased. Consistently, knockdown of PTPRF resulted in a decrease in the expression of genes associated with cancer stem cells downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Treating PTPRF knockdown cells with GSK3 inhibitor rescued the expression of Wnt target genes suggesting that PTPRF functions upstream of the β-catenin destruction complex. PTPRF was found to interact with LRP6 and silencing PTPRF largely decreased the activation of LRP6. Interestingly, this PTPRF-mediated activation of Wnt signaling was blocked in cells treated with clathrin endocytosis inhibitor. Furthermore, knockdown of PTPRF inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo and decreased the expression of Wnt target genes. Taken together, our studies identify a novel role of PTPRF as an oncogenic protein phosphatase in supporting the activation of Wnt signaling in CRC.	
32208894        	Patient-derived cancer modeling for precision medicine in colorectal cancer: beyond the cancer cell line.            	Since effective immunotherapeutic agents such as immune checkpoint blockade to treat cancer have emerged, the need for reliable preclinical cancer models that can evaluate and discover such drugs became stronger than ever before. The traditional preclinical cancer model using a cancer cell line has several limitations to recapitulate intra-tumor heterogeneity and in-vivo tumor activity including interactions between tumor-microenvironment. In this review, we will go over various preclinical cancer models recently discovered including patient-derived xenografts, humanized mice, organoids, organotypic-tumor spheroids, and organ-on-a-chip models. Moreover, we will discuss the future directions of preclinical cancer research.	
30035371        	TFF1 antagonizes TIMP-1 mediated proliferative functions in gastric cancer.            	Tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1) is one of four identified members of the TIMP family. We evaluated the role of TIMP1 in gastric cancer using human and mouse tissues along with gastric organoids and in vitro cell models. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we detected significant overexpression of TIMP1 in the human gastric cancer samples, as compared to normal stomach samples (P < 0.01). We also detected overexpression of Timp1 in neoplastic gastric lesions of the Tff1-knockout (KO) mice, as compared to normal stomach tissues. Reconstitution of TFF1 in human gastric cancer cell lines led to a significant decrease in the mRNA expression level of TIMP1 (P < 0.05). In vitro analysis demonstrated that TIMP1 mRNA expression is induced by TNF-α and activation of NF-κB whereas inhibition of NF-κB using BAY11-7082 led to inhibition of NF-κB and downregulation of TIMP1. Western blot analysis confirmed the decrease in TIMP1 protein level following reconstitution of TFF1. By using immunofluorescence, we showed nuclear localization of NF-κB and expression of TIMP1 in gastric organoids established from the Tff1-KO stomach where reconstitution of Tff1 using recombinant protein led to a notable reduction in the expression of both NF-κB and TIMP1. Using EDU assay, as a measure of proliferating cells, we found that TIMP1 promotes cellular proliferation whereas TFF1 reconstitution leads to a significant decrease in cellular proliferation (P < 0.05). In summary, our findings demonstrate overexpression of TIMP1 in mouse and human gastric cancers through NF-kB-dependent mechanism. We also show that TFF1 suppresses NF-κB and inhibits TIMP1-mediated proliferative potential in gastric cancer.                © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
25539675        	A novel human gastric primary cell culture system for modelling Helicobacter pylori infection in vitro.            	Helicobacter pylori is the causative agent of gastric diseases and the main risk factor in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. In vitro studies with this bacterial pathogen largely rely on the use of transformed cell lines as infection model. However, this approach is intrinsically artificial and especially inappropriate when it comes to investigating the mechanisms of cancerogenesis. Moreover, common cell lines are often defective in crucial signalling pathways relevant to infection and cancer. A long-lived primary cell system would be preferable in order to better approximate the human in vivo situation.                Gastric glands were isolated from healthy human stomach tissue and grown in Matrigel containing media supplemented with various growth factors, developmental regulators and apoptosis inhibitors to generate long-lasting normal epithelial cell cultures.                Culture conditions were developed which support the formation and quasi-indefinite growth of three dimensional (3D) spheroids derived from various sites of the human stomach. Spheroids could be differentiated to gastric organoids after withdrawal of Wnt3A and R-spondin1 from the medium. The 3D cultures exhibit typical morphological features of human stomach tissue. Transfer of sheared spheroids into 2D culture led to the formation of dense planar cultures of polarised epithelial cells serving as a suitable in vitro model of H. pylori infection.                A robust and quasi-immortal 3D organoid model has been established, which is considered instrumental for future research aimed to understand the underlying mechanisms of infection, mucosal immunity and cancer of the human stomach.

32512040        	The DNA damage response pathway as a land of therapeutic opportunities for colorectal cancer.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Although significant progress has been made by molecular and immune therapeutic approaches, prognosis of advanced stage disease is still dismal. Alterations in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are emerging as novel targets for treatment across different cancer types. However, even though preclinical studies have shown the potential exploitation of DDR alterations in CRC, systematic and comprehensive testing is lagging and clinical development is based on analogies with other solid tumors according to a tissue-agnostic paradigm. Recently, functional evidence from patient-derived xenografts and organoids have suggested that maintenance with PARP inhibitors might represent a therapeutic opportunity in CRC patients previously responsive to platinum-based treatment.                In this review, we highlight the most promising preclinical data and systematically summarize published clinical trials in which DDR inhibitors have been used for CRC and provide evidence that disappointing results have been mainly due to a lack of clinical and molecular selection.                Future preclinical and translational research will help in better understanding the role of DDR alterations in CRC and pave the way to novel strategies that might have a transformative impact on treatment by identifying new therapeutic options including tailored use of standard chemotherapy.

30783683        	Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer biology: tempering a double-edged sword.            	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection affects an estimated 4.4 billion people globally. Moreover, H. pylori presents the most significant risk factor for gastric cancer and low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and it is the first example of bacterial infection linked to carcinogenesis. Here, we contend that H. pylori research, which focuses on a cancer-causing pathogen resident in a relatively accessible organ, the stomach, could constitute an exemplar for microbial-related carcinogenesis in less tractable organs, such as the pancreas and lung. In this context, molecular biological approaches that could reap rewards are reviewed, including: (1) gastric cancer dynamics, particularly the role of stem cells and the heterogeneity of neoplastic cells, which are currently being investigated at the single-cell sequencing level; (2) mechanobiology, and the role of three-dimensional organoids and matrix metalloproteases; and (3) the connection between H. pylori and host pathophysiology and the gut microbiome. In the context of H. pylori's contribution to gastric cancer, several important conundrums remain to be fully elucidated. From among them, this article discusses (1) why H. pylori infection, which causes both gastric and duodenal inflammation, is only linked to gastric cancer; (2) whether a "precision oncomicrobiology" approach could enable a fine-tuning of the expression of only cancer-implicated H. pylori genes while maintaining beneficial H. pylori-mediated factors in extra-gastric tissues; and (3) the feasibility of using antibiotics targeting the microbial DNA damage system, which shares commonalities with mechanisms for human cell replication, as chemopreventives. Additional therapeutic perspectives are also discussed.	
29484537        	Establishment of two basal-like breast cancer cell lines with extremely low tumorigenicity from Taiwanese premenopausal women.            	The research of carcinogenetic mechanisms of breast cancer in different ethnic backgrounds is an interesting field, as clinical features of breast cancers vary among races. High premenopausal incidence is distinctive in East-Asian breast cancer. However, human cell lines derived from Asian primary breast tumor are rare. To provide alternative cell line models with a relevant genetic background, we aimed to establish breast cancer cell lines from Taiwanese patients of Han-Chinese ethnicity. Fresh tissue from mammary tumors were digested into organoids, plated and grown in basal serum-free medium of human mammary epithelial cells (HuMEC) with supplements. Cells were further enriched by positive selection with CD326 (epithelial cell adhesion molecule; EpCAM)-coated micro-magnetic beads. Two breast cancer cell lines derived from premenopausal women were successfully established by this method, and named Chang-Gung Breast Cancer 01 (CGBC 01) and 02 (CGBC 02). These two cell lines had a similar phenotype with weak expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and without amplification of receptor tyrosine protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2/neu). Genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array showed multiple copy number alterations in both cell lines. Based on gene expression profiles, CGBC 01 and 02 were clustered into basal-like subtype with reference to the breast cancer cell line gene expression database. The tumorigenicity of both cell lines was extremely low in both anchorage-independence assay and transplantation into the mammary fat pads of nude mice. CGBC 01 and CGBC 02 are low tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines, established from Han-Chinese premenopausal breast cancer patients, which serve as in vitro models in studying the biological features of Asian breast cancer.	
24481605        	Colonic myofibroblast cell line stimulates colonoid formation.            	A stable and efficient system for the culture of murine colon epithelial cells or crypts is required to facilitate studies of the dynamics and factors affecting colon stem cell niche and crypt formation. Survival of colonic epithelial cells or crypts in vitro was not established until recently, when it was found that exogenous Wnt3A and R-spondin could promote cell survival and formation of spheroids (colonospheres) or some advanced organoids with well-developed crypts (colonoids). However, after 6-8 days in these culture conditions, only small numbers of colonospheres form organoids with crypt-like structures (colonoids). This study describes the use of a myofibroblast cell line and a coculture system that increases the efficiency of colonoid formation from isolated crypts. The enhanced coculture system has significantly improved colonoid-forming efficiency compared with results from previous systems. Crypt formation can be detected as early as day 2. The coculture system will facilitate the characterization of the colon stem cell niche and the changes that occur as a result of perturbations or mutations in colon stem or epithelial cells, such as those that favor precancerous adenoma or cancer.	
30884019        	KRAS mutations in the parental tumour accelerate in vitro growth of tumoroids established from colorectal adenocarcinoma.            	The aim of the present study was to characterize a patient-derived in vitro 3D model (ie tumoroid) established from colorectal adenocarcinoma. This study investigated the growth rate of tumoroids and whether the Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutations in the parental tumour accelerate this rate. The tumoroids were established from surgical resections of primary and metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma from 26 patients. The in vitro growth rate of these tumoroids was monitored by automated imaging and recorded as relative growth rate. The KRAS hotspot mutations were investigated on the parental tumours by Ion Torrent™ next-generation sequencing. The KRAS mutations were detected in 58% of the parental tumours, and a significantly higher growth rate was observed for tumoroids established from the KRAS-mutated tumours compared to wild-type tumours (P < 0.0001). The average relative growth rate (log10) on day 10 was 0.360 ± 0.180 (mean ± SD) for the KRAS-mutated group and 0.098 ± 0.135 (mean ± SD) for the KRAS wild-type group. These results showed that the presence of KRAS mutations in parental tumours is associated with an acceleration of the growth rate of tumoroids. The future perspective for such a model could be the implementation of chemoassays for personalized medicine.                © 2019 The Authors.

29510994        	Tight Junction Protein Claudin-2 Promotes Self-Renewal of Human Colorectal Cancer Stem-like Cells.            	Posttreatment recurrence of colorectal cancer, the third most lethal cancer worldwide, is often driven by a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSC). The tight junction (TJ) protein claudin-2 is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer, where it enhances cell proliferation, colony formation, and chemoresistance in vitro While several of these biological processes are features of the CSC phenotype, a role for claudin-2 in the regulation of these has not been identified. Here, we report that elevated claudin-2 expression in stage II/III colorectal tumors is associated with poor recurrence-free survival following 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, an outcome in which CSCs play an instrumental role. In patient-derived organoids, primary cells, and cell lines, claudin-2 promoted colorectal cancer self-renewal in vitro and in multiple mouse xenograft models. Claudin-2 enhanced self-renewal of ALDHHigh CSCs and increased their proportion in colorectal cancer cell populations, limiting their differentiation and promoting the phenotypic transition of non-CSCs toward the ALDHHigh phenotype. Next-generation sequencing in ALDHHigh cells revealed that claudin-2 regulated expression of nine miRNAs known to control stem cell signaling. Among these, miR-222-3p was instrumental for the regulation of self-renewal by claudin-2, and enhancement of this self-renewal required activation of YAP, most likely upstream from miR-222-3p. Taken together, our results indicate that overexpression of claudin-2 promotes self-renewal within colorectal cancer stem-like cells, suggesting a potential role for this protein as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.Significance: Claudin-2-mediated regulation of YAP activity and miR-222-3p expression drives CSC renewal in colorectal cancer, making it a potential target for therapy.

30127402        	BCL11A interacts with SOX2 to control the expression of epigenetic regulators in lung squamous carcinoma.            	Patients diagnosed with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) have limited targeted therapies. We report here the identification and characterisation of BCL11A, as a LUSC oncogene. Analysis of cancer genomics datasets revealed BCL11A to be upregulated in LUSC but not in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Experimentally we demonstrate that non-physiological levels of BCL11A in vitro and in vivo promote squamous-like phenotypes, while its knockdown abolishes xenograft tumour formation. At the molecular level we found that BCL11A is transcriptionally regulated by SOX2 and is required for its oncogenic functions. Furthermore, we show that BCL11A and SOX2 regulate the expression of several transcription factors, including SETD8. We demonstrate that shRNA-mediated or pharmacological inhibition of SETD8 selectively inhibits LUSC growth. Collectively, our study indicates that BCL11A is integral to LUSC pathology and highlights the disruption of the BCL11A-SOX2 transcriptional programme as a novel candidate for drug development.	
28297666        	Canonical Wnt Signaling Ameliorates Aging of Intestinal Stem Cells.            	Although intestinal homeostasis is maintained by intestinal stem cells (ISCs), regeneration is impaired upon aging. Here, we first uncover changes in intestinal architecture, cell number, and cell composition upon aging. Second, we identify a decline in the regenerative capacity of ISCs upon aging because of a decline in canonical Wnt signaling in ISCs. Changes in expression of Wnts are found in stem cells themselves and in their niche, including Paneth cells and mesenchyme. Third, reactivating canonical Wnt signaling enhances the function of both murine and human ISCs and, thus, ameliorates aging-associated phenotypes of ISCs in an organoid assay. Our data demonstrate a role for impaired Wnt signaling in physiological aging of ISCs and further identify potential therapeutic avenues to improve ISC regenerative potential upon aging.

32766274        	The Changing Face of in vitro Culture Models for Thyroid Cancer Research: A Systematic Literature Review.            	Background: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy worldwide. Primary treatment with surgery and radioactive iodine is usually successful, however, there remains a small proportion of thyroid cancers that are resistant to these treatments, and often represent aggressive forms of the disease. Since the 1950s, in vitro thyroid culture systems have been used in thyroid cancer research. In vitro culture models have evolved from 2-dimensional thyrocyte monolayers into physiologically functional 3-dimensional organoids. Recently, research groups have utilized in vitro thyroid cancer models to identify numerous genetic and epigenetic factors that are involved with tumorigenesis as well as test the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs on thyroid cancer cells and identify cancer stem cells within thyroid tumors. Objective of Review: The objective of this literature review is to summarize how thyroid in vitro culture models have evolved and highlight how in vitro models have been fundamental to thyroid cancer research. Type of Review: Systematic literature review. Search Strategy: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Healthcare and Databases Advanced Search (HDAS) tool was used to search EMBASE, Medline and PubMed databases. The following terms were included in the search: "in vitro" AND "thyroid cancer". The search period was confined from January 2008 until June 2019. A manual search of the references of review articles and other key articles was also performed using Google Scholar. Evaluation Method: All experimental studies and review articles that explicitly mentioned the use of in vitro models for thyroid cancer research in the title and/or abstract were considered. Full-text versions of all selected articles were evaluated. Experimental studies were reviewed and grouped according to topic: genetics/epigenetics, drug testing/cancer treatment, and side populations (SP)/tumor microenvironment (TME). Results: Three thousand three hundred and seventy three articles were identified through database and manual searches. One thousand two hundred and sixteen articles remained after duplicates were removed. Five hundred and eighty nine articles were excluded based on title and/or abstract. Of the remaining 627 full-text articles: 24 were review articles, 332 related to genetic/epigenetics, 240 related to drug testing/treatments, and 31 related to SP/TME. Conclusion:In vitro cell culture models have been fundamental in thyroid cancer research. There have been many advances in culture techniques- developing complex cellular architecture that more closely resemble tumors in vivo. Genetic and epigenetic factors that have been identified using in vitro culture models can be used as targets for novel drug therapies. In the future, in vitro systems will facilitate personalized medicine, offering bespoke treatments to patients.                Copyright © 2020 Chew, Green, Riley, England and Greenman.	
33421513        	Zinc-Dependent Regulation of ZEB1 and YAP1 Coactivation Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Plasticity and Metastasis in Pancreatic Cancer.            	Pancreatic cancer is characterized by extensive metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plasticity plays a critical role in tumor progression and metastasis by maintaining the transition between EMT and mesenchymal-epithelial transition states. Our aim is to understand the molecular events regulating metastasis and EMT plasticity in pancreatic cancer.                The interactions between a cancer-promoting zinc transporter ZIP4, a zinc-dependent EMT transcriptional factor ZEB1, a coactivator YAP1, and integrin α3 (ITGA3) were examined in human pancreatic cancer cells, clinical specimens, spontaneous mouse models (KPC and KPCZ) and orthotopic xenografts, and 3-dimensional spheroid and organoid models. Correlations between ZIP4, miR-373, and its downstream targets were assessed by RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining. The transcriptional regulation of ZEB1, YAP1, and ITGA3 by ZIP4 was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays.                The Hippo pathway effector YAP1 is a potent transcriptional coactivator and forms a complex with ZEB1 to activate ITGA3 transcription through the YAP1/transcriptional enhanced associate domain binding sites in human pancreatic cancer cells and KPC-derived mouse cells. ZIP4 upregulated YAP1 expression via activation of miR-373 and inhibition of the YAP1 repressor large tumor suppressor 2 kinase. Furthermore, upregulation of ZIP4 promoted EMT plasticity, cell adhesion, spheroid formation, and organogenesis both in human pancreatic cancer cells, 3-dimensional spheroid model, xenograft model, and spontaneous mouse models (KPC and KPCZ) through ZEB1/YAP1-ITGA3 signaling axis.                We demonstrated that ZIP4 activates ZEB1 and YAP1 through distinct mechanisms. The ZIP4-miR-373-LATS2-ZEB1/YAP1-ITGA3 signaling axis has a significant impact on pancreatic cancer metastasis and EMT plasticity.                Copyright © 2021 AGA Institute.

31790273        	IFN-γ and IL-17A regulate intestinal crypt production of CXCL10 in the healthy and inflamed colon.            	During intestinal inflammation, immature cells within the intestinal crypt are called upon to replenish lost epithelial cell populations, promote tissue regeneration, and restore barrier integrity. Inflammatory mediators including TH1/TH17-associated cytokines influence tissue health and regenerative processes, yet how these cytokines directly influence the colon crypt epithelium and whether the crypt remains responsive to these cytokines during active damage and repair, remain unclear. Here, using laser-capture microdissection and primary colon organoid culture, we show that the cytokine milieu regulates the ability of the colonic crypt epithelium to participate in proinflammatory signaling. IFN-γ induces the TH1-recruiting, proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10/IP10 in primary murine intestinal crypt epithelium. CXCL10 was also induced in colonic organoids derived from mice with active, experimentally induced colitis, suggesting that the crypt can actively secrete CXCL10 in select cytokine environments during colitis. Colon expression of cxcl10 further increased during infectious and noninfectious colitis in Il17a-/- mice, demonstrating that IL-17A exerts a negative effect on CXCL10 in vivo. Furthermore, IL-17A directly antagonized CXCL10 production in ex vivo organoid cultures derived from healthy murine colons. Interestingly, direct antagonism of CXCL10 was not observed in organoids derived from colitic mouse colons bearing active lesions. These data, highlighting the complex interplay between the cytokine milieu and crypt epithelia, demonstrate proinflammatory chemokines can be induced within the colonic crypt and suggest the crypt remains responsive to cytokine modulation during inflammation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Upon damage, the intestinal epithelium regenerates to restore barrier function. Here we observe that the local colonic cytokine milieu controls the production of procolitic chemokines within the crypt base and colon crypts remain responsive to cytokines during inflammation. IFN-γ promotes, while IL-17 antagonizes, CXCL10 production in healthy colonic crypts, while responses to cytokines differ in inflamed colon epithelium. These data reveal novel insight into colon crypt responses and inflammation-relevant alterations in signaling.	
33109032        	Drug Repurposing in Oncology: Current Evidence and Future Direction.            	Drug repurposing, the application of known drugs and compounds with a non-oncology primary purpose, might be an attractive strategy to offer more effective treatment options to patients with cancer at a low cost and reduced time.                This review described a total of 10 kinds of non-oncological drugs from more than 100 mechanical studies as well as evidence from population-based studies. The future direction of repurposed drug screening was discussed by using patient-derived tumor organoids.                Many old drugs showed previously unknown effects or off-target effects and can be intelligently applied for cancer chemoprevention and therapy. The identification of repurposed drugs needs to combine evidence from mechanical studies and population-based studies. Due to the heterogeneity of cancer, patient-derived tumor organoids can be used to screen the non-oncological drugs in vitro.                These identified old drugs could be repurposed in oncology and might be added as adjuvants and finally benefit patients with cancers.

30948494        	Constitutive STAT5 activation regulates Paneth and Paneth-like cells to control Clostridium difficile colitis.            	Clostridium difficile impairs Paneth cells, driving intestinal inflammation that exaggerates colitis. Besides secreting bactericidal products to restrain C. difficile, Paneth cells act as guardians that constitute a niche for intestinal epithelial stem cell (IESC) regeneration. However, how IESCs are sustained to specify Paneth-like cells as their niche remains unclear. Cytokine-JAK-STATs are required for IESC regeneration. We investigated how constitutive STAT5 activation (Ca-pYSTAT5) restricts IESC differentiation towards niche cells to restrain C. difficile infection. We generated inducible transgenic mice and organoids to determine the effects of Ca-pYSTAT5-induced IESC lineages on C. difficile colitis. We found that STAT5 absence reduced Paneth cells and predisposed mice to C. difficile ileocolitis. In contrast, Ca-pYSTAT5 enhanced Paneth cell lineage tracing and restricted Lgr5 IESC differentiation towards pYSTAT5+Lgr5-CD24+Lyso+ or cKit+ niche cells, which imprinted Lgr5hiKi67+ IESCs. Mechanistically, pYSTAT5 activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling to determine Paneth cell fate. In conclusion, Ca-pYSTAT5 gradients control niche differentiation. Lack of pYSTAT5 reduces the niche cells to sustain IESC regeneration and induces C. difficile ileocolitis. STAT5 may be a transcription factor that regulates Paneth cells to maintain niche regeneration.                © 2019 Liu et al.	
32899796        	Current Status and Perspectives of Patient-Derived Models for Ewing's Sarcoma.            	Patient-derived cancer models, including cell lines, organoids, and xenografts, are indispensable tools in cancer research. These models, which recapitulate molecular features of original tumors, allow studies on the biological significance of cancer-associated genes, antitumor effects of novel agents, and molecular mechanisms underlying clinical behaviors of tumors. Moreover, the predictive utility of patient-derived cancer models is expected to facilitate drug development and precision medicine. Ewing's sarcoma is a highly aggressive mesenchymal tumor with a high metastasis rate. Previous studies demonstrated the utility of cell lines and xenografts in Ewing's sarcoma research and clinical studies. However, the number of Ewing's sarcoma models available from public biobanks is limited; this creates an obstacle for research on Ewing's sarcoma. Novel Ewing's sarcoma models are needed to establish their utility, further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms, and help develop effective therapeutic strategies. In this review, the current status of patient-derived cancer models is overviewed, and future prospects of model development are discussed from the perspective of Ewing's sarcoma research. It should be of interest to researchers and clinicians who work on patient-derived cancer models.	
26119944        	Heat-shock factor 2 is a suppressor of prostate cancer invasion.            	Heat-shock factors (HSFs) are key transcriptional regulators in cell survival. Although HSF1 has been identified as a driver of carcinogenesis, HSF2 has not been explored in malignancies. Here, we report that HSF2 suppresses tumor invasion of prostate cancer (PrCa). In three-dimensional organotypic cultures and the in vivo xenograft chorioallantoic membrane model HSF2 knockdown perturbs organoid differentiation and promotes invasiveness. Gene expression profiling together with functional studies demonstrated that the molecular mechanism underlying the effect on tumor progression originates from HSF2 steering the switch between acinar morphogenesis and invasion. This is achieved by the regulation of genes connected to, for example, GTPase activity, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Importantly, low HSF2 expression correlates with high Gleason score, metastasis and poor survival of PrCa patients, highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings. Finally, the study was expanded beyond PrCa, revealing that the expression of HSF2 is decreased in a wide range of cancer types. This study provides the first evidence for HSF2 acting as a suppressor of invasion in human malignancies.	
31727279        	Patient-derived tumor models of esophageal cancer.            	Tumor models are powerful tools to plan preclinical therapeutic strategies that cannot be conducted on humans. Recently, patient-derived tumor models such as patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and/or patient-derived organoid (PDO), are widely used to investigate the antitumor effects of various drugs, because those tumors resemble original tumors at the physiological and molecular level. In this chapter, we describe patient-derived tumor models of esophageal cancers and outline the latest research as well as the molecular pathology of esophageal cancers.                © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

31129492        	Notch and mTOR Signaling Pathways Promote Human Gastric Cancer Cell Proliferation.            	Notch pathway signaling is known to promote gastric stem cell proliferation, and constitutive pathway activation induces gastric tumors via mTORC1 activation in mouse genetic models. The purpose of this study was to determine whether human gastric adenocarcinomas are similarly dependent on Notch and mTORC1 signaling for growth. Gene expression profiling of 415 human gastric adenocarcinomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas, and a small set of locally obtained gastric cancers showed enhanced expression of Notch pathway components, including Notch ligands, receptors and downstream target genes. Human gastric adenocarcinoma tissues and chemically induced mouse gastric tumors both exhibited heightened Notch and mTORC1 pathway signaling activity, as evidenced by increased expression of the NOTCH1 receptor signaling fragment NICD, the Notch target HES1, and the mTORC1 target phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein. Pharmacologic inhibition of either Notch or mTORC1 signaling reduced growth of human gastric cancer cell lines, with combined pathway inhibition causing a further reduction in growth, suggesting that both pathways are activated to promote gastric cancer cell proliferation. Further, mTORC1 signaling was reduced after Notch inhibition suggesting that mTOR is downstream of Notch in gastric cancer cells. Analysis of human gastric organoids derived from paired control and gastric cancer tissues also exhibited reduced growth in culture after Notch or mTOR inhibition. Thus, our studies demonstrate that Notch and mTOR signaling pathways are commonly activated in human gastric cancer to promote cellular proliferation. Targeting these pathways in combination might be an effective therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer treatment.                Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

30496442        	Mutant p53 in colon cancer.            	The accumulation of genetic alterations in driver genes is responsible for the development and malignant progression of colorectal cancer. Comprehensive genome analyses have revealed the driver genes, including APC, KRAS, TGFBR2, and TP53, whose mutations are frequently found in human colorectal cancers. Among them, the p53 mutation is found in ~60% of colorectal cancers, and a majority of mutations are missense-type at 'hot spots', suggesting an oncogenic role of mutant p53 by 'gain-of-function' mechanisms. Mouse model studies have shown that one of these missense-type mutations, p53 R270H (corresponding to human R273H), causes submucosal invasion of intestinal tumors, while the loss of wild-type p53 has a limited effect on the invasion process. Furthermore, the same mutant p53 promotes metastasis when combined with Kras activation and TGF-β suppression. Importantly, either missense-type p53 mutation or loss of wild-type p53 induces NF-κB activation by a variety of mechanisms, such as increasing promoter accessibility by chromatin remodeling, which may contribute to progression to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results indicate that missense-type p53 mutations together with loss of wild-type p53 accelerate the late stage of colorectal cancer progression through the activation of both oncogenic and inflammatory pathways. Accordingly, the suppression of the mutant p53 function via the inhibition of nuclear accumulation is expected to be an effective strategy against malignant progression of colorectal cancer.                © The Author(s) (2019).

31253799        	A high-throughput screening and computation platform for identifying synthetic promoters with enhanced cell-state specificity (SPECS).            	Cell state-specific promoters constitute essential tools for basic research and biotechnology because they activate gene expression only under certain biological conditions. Synthetic Promoters with Enhanced Cell-State Specificity (SPECS) can be superior to native ones, but the design of such promoters is challenging and frequently requires gene regulation or transcriptome knowledge that is not readily available. Here, to overcome this challenge, we use a next-generation sequencing approach combined with machine learning to screen a synthetic promoter library with 6107 designs for high-performance SPECS for potentially any cell state. We demonstrate the identification of multiple SPECS that exhibit distinct spatiotemporal activity during the programmed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), as well as SPECS for breast cancer and glioblastoma stem-like cells. We anticipate that this approach could be used to create SPECS for gene therapies that are activated in specific cell states, as well as to study natural transcriptional regulatory networks.	
26073086        	Par6G suppresses cell proliferation and is targeted by loss-of-function mutations in multiple cancers.            	Differentiated epithelial structure communicates with individual constituent epithelial cells to suppress their proliferation activity. However, the pathways linking epithelial structure to cessation of the cell proliferation machinery or to unscheduled proliferation in the context of tumorigenesis are not well defined. Here we demonstrate the strong impact of compromised epithelial integrity on normal and oncogenic Myc-driven proliferation in three-dimensional mammary epithelial organoid culture. Systematic silencing of 34 human homologs of Drosophila genes, with previously established functions in control of epithelial integrity, demonstrates a role for human genes of apico-basal polarity, Wnt and Hippo pathways and actin dynamics in regulation of the size, integrity and cell proliferation in organoids. Perturbation of these pathways leads to diverse functional interactions with Myc: manifested as a RhoA-dependent synthetic lethality and Par6-dependent effects on the cell cycle. Furthermore, we show a role for Par6G as a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1/Akt pathway and epithelial cell proliferation and evidence for frequent inactivation of Par6G gene in epithelial cancers. The findings demonstrate that determinants of epithelial structure regulate the cell proliferation activity via conserved and cancer-relevant regulatory circuitries, which are important for epithelial cell cycle restriction and may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention.	
33435818        	Progress towards non-small-cell lung cancer models that represent clinical evolutionary trajectories.            	Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although advances are being made towards earlier detection and the development of impactful targeted therapies and immunotherapies, the 5-year survival of patients with advanced disease is still below 20%. Effective cancer research relies on pre-clinical model systems that accurately reflect the evolutionary course of disease progression and mimic patient responses to therapy. Here, we review pre-clinical models, including genetically engineered mouse models and patient-derived materials, such as cell lines, primary cell cultures, explant cultures and xenografts, that are currently being used to interrogate NSCLC evolution from pre-invasive disease through locally invasive cancer to the metastatic colonization of distant organ sites.	
32231028        	An Organotypic Microcosm for the Pancreatic Tumor Microenvironment.            	Pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the next few years. Unfortunately, the development of novel therapies for PDAC has been challenged by a uniquely complex tumor microenvironment. The development of in vitro cancer organoids in recent years has demonstrated potential to increase therapies for patients with PDAC. Organoids have been established from PDAC murine and human tissues and they are representative of the primary tumor. Further, organoids have been shown beneficial in studies of molecular mechanisms and drug sensitivity testing. This review will cover the use of organoids to study PDAC development, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance in the context of the tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by a dense desmoplastic reaction, hindered immune activity, and pro-tumor metabolic signaling. We describe investigations utilizing organoids to characterize the tumor microenvironment and also describe their limitations. Overall, organoids have great potential to serve as a versatile model of drug response and may be used to increase available therapies and improve survival for patients with PDAC.

27043494        	Epithelial calcineurin controls microbiota-dependent intestinal tumor development.            	Inflammation-associated pathways are active in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and contribute to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Calcineurin, a phosphatase required for the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, shows increased expression in CRC. We therefore investigated the role of calcineurin in intestinal tumor development. We demonstrate that calcineurin and NFAT factors are constitutively expressed by primary IECs and selectively activated in intestinal tumors as a result of impaired stratification of the tumor-associated microbiota and toll-like receptor signaling. Epithelial calcineurin supports the survival and proliferation of cancer stem cells in an NFAT-dependent manner and promotes the development of intestinal tumors in mice. Moreover, somatic mutations that have been identified in human CRC are associated with constitutive activation of calcineurin, whereas nuclear translocation of NFAT is associated with increased death from CRC. These findings highlight an epithelial cell-intrinsic pathway that integrates signals derived from the commensal microbiota to promote intestinal tumor development.	
28380450        	The G-protein coupled receptor 56, expressed in colonic stem and cancer cells, binds progastrin to promote proliferation and carcinogenesis.            	Overexpression of human progastrin increases colonic mucosal proliferation and colorectal cancer progression in mice. The G-protein coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) is known to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and stem cell biology, but its expression in the gut has not been studied. We hypothesized that the promotion of colorectal cancer by progastrin may be mediated in part through GPR56. Here, we found that GPR56 expresses in rare colonic crypt cells that lineage trace colonic glands consistent with GPR56 marking long-lived colonic stem-progenitor cells. GPR56 was upregulated in transgenic mice overexpressing human progastrin. While recombinant human progastrin promoted the growth and survival of wild-type colonic organoids in vitro, colonic organoids cultured from GPR56-/- mice were resistant to progastrin. We found that progastrin directly bound to, and increased the proliferation of, GPR56-expressing colon cancer cells in vitro, and proliferation was increased in cells that expressed both GPR56 and the cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK2R). In vivo, deletion of GPR56 in the mouse germline abrogated progastrin-dependent colonic mucosal proliferation and increased apoptosis. Loss of GPR56 also inhibited progastrin-dependent colonic crypt fission and colorectal carcinogenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM) mouse model of colorectal cancer. Overall, we found that progastrin binds to GPR56 expressing colonic stem cells, which in turn promotes their expansion, and that this GPR56-dependent pathway is an important driver and potential new target in colorectal carcinogenesis.	
28805820        	Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations confer resistance to BET inhibitors through stabilization of BRD4.            	The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins comprises four members-BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and the testis-specific isoform BRDT-that largely function as transcriptional coactivators and play critical roles in various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion. BET proteins enhance the oncogenic functions of major cancer drivers by elevating the expression of these drivers, such as c-Myc in leukemia, or by promoting the transcriptional activities of oncogenic factors, such as AR and ERG in prostate cancer. Pathologically, BET proteins are frequently overexpressed and are clinically linked to various types of human cancer; they are therefore being pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for selective inhibition in patients with cancer. To this end, a number of bromodomain inhibitors, including JQ1 and I-BET, have been developed and have shown promising outcomes in early clinical trials. Although resistance to BET inhibitors has been documented in preclinical models, the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance are largely unknown. Here we report that cullin-3SPOP earmarks BET proteins, including BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Pathologically, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote the degradation of BET proteins, leading to their elevated abundance in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer. As a result, prostate cancer cell lines and organoids derived from individuals harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to BET-inhibitor-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, our results elucidate the tumor-suppressor role of SPOP in prostate cancer in which it acts as a negative regulator of BET protein stability and also provide a molecular mechanism for resistance to BET inhibitors in individuals with prostate cancer bearing SPOP mutations.	
33065047        	Modeling the Interaction between the Microenvironment and Tumor Cells in Brain Tumors.            	Despite considerable recent advances in understanding and treating many other cancers, malignant brain tumors remain associated with low survival or severe long-term sequelae. Limited progress, including development of immunotherapies, relates in part to difficulties in accurately reproducing brain microenvironment with current preclinical models. The cellular interactions among resident microglia, recruited tumor-associated macrophages, stromal cells, glial cells, neurons, and cancer cells and how they affect tumor growth or behavior are emerging, yet many questions remain. The role of the blood-brain barrier, extracellular matrix components, and heterogeneity among tumor types and within different regions of a single tumor further complicate the matter. Here, we focus on brain microenvironment features impacted by tumor biology. We also discuss limits of current preclinical models and how complementary models, such as humanized animals and organoids, will allow deeper mechanistic insights on cancer biology, allowing for more efficient testing of therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy, for brain cancers.

24336194        	Differential effects of 2- and 3-series E-prostaglandins on in vitro expansion of Lgr5+ colonic stem cells.            	Arachidonic acid (20:4(Δ5,8,11,14), AA)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promotes colon cancer development. In contrast, chemoprotective n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplant AA, thereby decreasing PGE2 biosynthesis in colonocytes, with eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5(Δ5,8,11,14,17), EPA) in particular being metabolized to a novel 3-series E-prostaglandin (PGE3), a putative anti-tumorigenic-cyclooxygenase metabolite. Because transformation of adult stem cells is an extremely important route toward initiating intestinal cancer, we utilized the leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-enhanced green fluorescent protein-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-creER(T2) knock-in mouse model to isolate and culture colonic organoids, in order to document ex vivo responses to exogenous PGE2 and PGE3. Colonic crypts were isolated from transgenic mice and cultured in a Matrigel-based three-dimensional platform. Organoids were treated with exogenous PGE2, PGE3 or dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle control) for 5 days and the number of viable organoids was recorded daily. Subsequently, samples were processed for immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and real-time PCR analyses. PGE2 promoted optimal organoid growth and induced significantly higher levels of cell proliferation (P < 0.05) compared with PGE3 and control. In contrast, the Lgr5-green fluorescent protein-positive stem cell number was uniquely elevated by >2-fold in PGE2-treated cultures compared with PGE3 and control. This coincided with the upregulation of stem-cell-related Sox9, Axin2 and Cd44 messenger RNAs. Our results demonstrate that relative to AA-derived PGE2, a known promoter of colon tumorigenesis, EPA-derived PGE3 has diminished ability to support colonic stem cell expansion in mouse colonic organoids.	
27329244        	RNF43 germline and somatic mutation in serrated neoplasia pathway and its association with BRAF mutation.            	Serrated polyps (hyperplastic polyps, sessile or traditional serrated adenomas), which can arise in a sporadic or polyposis setting, predispose to colorectal cancer (CRC), especially those with microsatellite instability (MSI) due to MLH1 promoter methylation (MLH1me+). We investigate genetic alterations in the serrated polyposis pathway.                We used a combination of exome sequencing and target gene Sanger sequencing to study serrated polyposis families, sporadic serrated polyps and CRCs, with validation by analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, followed by organoid-based functional studies.                In one out of four serrated polyposis families, we identified a germline RNF43 mutation that displayed autosomal dominant cosegregation with the serrated polyposis phenotype, along with second-hit inactivation through loss of heterozygosity or somatic mutations in all serrated polyps (16), adenomas (5) and cancer (1) examined, as well as coincidental BRAF mutation in 62.5% of the serrated polyps. Concurrently, somatic RNF43 mutations were identified in 34% of sporadic sessile/traditional serrated adenomas, but 0% of hyperplastic polyps (p=0.013). Lastly, in MSI CRCs, we found significantly more frequent RNF43 mutations in the MLH1me+ (85%) versus MLH1me- (33.3%) group (p<0.001). These findings were validated in the TCGA MSI CRCs (p=0.005), which further delineated a significant differential involvement of three Wnt pathway genes between these two groups (RNF43 in MLH1me+; APC and CTNNB1 in MLH1me-); and identified significant co-occurrence of BRAF and RNF43 mutations in the MSI (p<0.001), microsatellite stable (MSS) (p=0.002) and MLH1me+ MSI CRCs (p=0.042). Functionally, organoid culture of serrated adenoma or mouse colon with CRISPR-induced RNF43 mutations had reduced dependency on R-spondin1.                These results illustrate the importance of RNF43, along with BRAF mutation in the serrated neoplasia pathway (both the sporadic and familial forms), inform genetic diagnosis protocol and raise therapeutic opportunities through Wnt inhibition in different stages of evolution of serrated polyps.

29048660        	Canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling in cancer stem cells and their niches: Cellular heterogeneity, omics reprogramming, targeted therapy and tumor plasticity (Review).            	Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have the potential for self-renewal, differentiation and de-differentiation, undergo epigenetic, epithelial-mesenchymal, immunological and metabolic reprogramming to adapt to the tumor microenvironment and survive host defense or therapeutic insults. Intra-tumor heterogeneity and cancer-cell plasticity give rise to therapeutic resistance and recurrence through clonal replacement and reactivation of dormant CSCs, respectively. WNT signaling cascades cross-talk with the FGF, Notch, Hedgehog and TGFβ/BMP signaling cascades and regulate expression of functional CSC markers, such as CD44, CD133 (PROM1), EPCAM and LGR5 (GPR49). Aberrant canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling in human malignancies, including breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, ovary, pancreatic, prostate and uterine cancers, leukemia and melanoma, are involved in CSC survival, bulk-tumor expansion and invasion/metastasis. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics, such as anti-FZD1/2/5/7/8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (vantictumab), anti-LGR5 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) (mAb-mc-vc-PAB-MMAE), anti-PTK7 ADC (PF-06647020), anti-ROR1 mAb (cirmtuzumab), anti-RSPO3 mAb (rosmantuzumab), small-molecule porcupine inhibitors (ETC-159, WNT-C59 and WNT974), tankyrase inhibitors (AZ1366, G007-LK, NVP-TNKS656 and XAV939) and β-catenin inhibitors (BC2059, CWP232228, ICG-001 and PRI-724), are in clinical trials or preclinical studies for the treatment of patients with WNT-driven cancers. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics are applicable for combination therapy with BCR-ABL, EGFR, FLT3, KIT or RET inhibitors to treat a subset of tyrosine kinase-driven cancers because WNT and tyrosine kinase signaling cascades converge to β-catenin for the maintenance and expansion of CSCs. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics might also be applicable for combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockers, such as atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, to treat cancers with immune evasion, although the context-dependent effects of WNT signaling on immunity should be carefully assessed. Omics monitoring, such as genome sequencing and transcriptome tests, immunohistochemical analyses on PD-L1 (CD274), PD-1 (PDCD1), ROR1 and nuclear β-catenin and organoid-based drug screening, is necessary to determine the appropriate WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics for cancer patients.	
29708513        	DNA methyltransferase expression in triple-negative breast cancer predicts sensitivity to decitabine.            	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease with poor prognosis that lacks targeted therapies, especially in patients with chemotherapy-resistant disease. Since DNA methylation-induced silencing of tumor suppressors is common in cancer, reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine), an FDA-approved DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, has proven effective in treating hematological neoplasms. However, its antitumor effect varies in solid tumors, stressing the importance of identifying biomarkers predictive of therapeutic response. Here, we focused on the identification of biomarkers to select decitabine-sensitive TNBC through increasing our understanding of the mechanism of decitabine action. We showed that protein levels of DNMTs correlated with response to decitabine in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) organoids originating from chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant TNBCs, suggesting DNMT levels as potential biomarkers of response. Furthermore, all 3 methytransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, were degraded following low-concentration, long-term decitabine treatment both in vitro and in vivo. The DNMT proteins could be ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to lysosome-dependent protein degradation. Depletion of TRAF6 blocked decitabine-induced DNMT degradation, conferring resistance to decitabine. Our study suggests a potential mechanism of regulating DNMT protein degradation and DNMT levels as response biomarkers for DNMT inhibitors in TNBCs.	
24926316        	Culturing intestinal stem cells: applications for colorectal cancer research.            	Recent advance of sequencing technology has revealed genetic alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC). The biological function of recurrently mutated genes has been intensively investigated through mouse genetic models and CRC cell lines. Although these experimental models may not fully reflect biological traits of human intestinal epithelium, they provided insights into the understanding of intestinal stem cell self-renewal, leading to the development of novel human intestinal organoid culture system. Intestinal organoid culture enabled to expand normal or tumor epithelial cells in vitro retaining their stem cell self-renewal and multiple differentiation. Gene manipulation of these cultured cells may provide an attractive tool for investigating genetic events involved in colorectal carcinogenesis.

30497079        	Long Non-Coding RNA H19 Acts as an Estrogen Receptor Modulator that is Required for Endocrine Therapy Resistance in ER+ Breast Cancer Cells.            	Blocking estrogen signaling with endocrine therapies (Tamoxifen or Fulverstrant) is an effective treatment for Estrogen Receptor-α positive (ER+) breast cancer tumours. Unfortunately, development of endocrine therapy resistance (ETR) is a frequent event resulting in disease relapse and decreased overall patient survival. The long noncoding RNA, H19, was previously shown to play a significant role in estrogen-induced proliferation of both normal and malignant ER+ breast epithelial cells. We hypothesized that H19 expression is also important for the proliferation and survival of ETR cells.                Here we utilized established ETR cell models; the Tamoxifen (Tam)-resistant LCC2 and the Fulvestrant and Tam cross-resistant LCC9 cells. Gain and loss of H19 function were achieved through lentiviral transduction as well as pharmacological inhibitors of the Notch and c-Met receptor signaling pathways. The effects of altered H19 expression on cell viability and ETR were assessed using three-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures and 2D co-cultures with low passage tumour-associated fbroblasts (TAFs).                Here we report that treating ETR cells with Tam or Fulvestrant increases H19 expression and that it's decreased expression overcomes resistance to Tam and Fulvestrant in these cells. Interestingly, H19 expression is regulated by Notch and HGF signaling in the ETR cells and pharmacological inhibitors of Notch and c-MET signaling together significantly reverse resistance to Tam and Fulvestrant in an H19-dependent manner in these cells. Lastly, we demonstrate that H19 regulates ERα expression at the transcript and protein levels in the ETR cells and that H19 protects ERα against Fulvestrant-mediated downregulation of ERα protein. We also observed that blocking Notch and the c-MET receptor signaling also overcomes Fulvestrant and Tam resistance in 3D organoid cultures by decreasing ERα and H19 expression in the ETR cells.                In endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer cells Fulvestrant is ineffective in decreasing ERα levels. Our data suggest that in the ETR cells, H19 expression acts as an ER modulator and that its levels and subsequently ERα levels can be substantially decreased by blocking Notch and c-MET receptor signaling. Consequently, treating ETR cells with these pharmacological inhibitors helps overcome resistance to Fulvestrant and Tamoxifen.                © 2018 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.	
31685988        	A MYC-GCN2-eIF2α negative feedback loop limits protein synthesis to prevent MYC-dependent apoptosis in colorectal cancer.            	Tumours depend on altered rates of protein synthesis for growth and survival, which suggests that mechanisms controlling mRNA translation may be exploitable for therapy. Here, we show that loss of APC, which occurs almost universally in colorectal tumours, strongly enhances the dependence on the translation initiation factor eIF2B5. Depletion of eIF2B5 induces an integrated stress response and enhances translation of MYC via an internal ribosomal entry site. This perturbs cellular amino acid and nucleotide pools, strains energy resources and causes MYC-dependent apoptosis. eIF2B5 limits MYC expression and prevents apoptosis in APC-deficient murine and patient-derived organoids and in APC-deficient murine intestinal epithelia in vivo. Conversely, the high MYC levels present in APC-deficient cells induce phosphorylation of eIF2α via the kinases GCN2 and PKR. Pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 phenocopies eIF2B5 depletion and has therapeutic efficacy in tumour organoids, which demonstrates that a negative MYC-eIF2α feedback loop constitutes a targetable vulnerability of colorectal tumours.	
29786791        	Protocols for Studies on TMPRSS2/ERG in Prostate Cancer.            	TMPRSS2/ERG is the most common type of gene fusions found in human prostate cancer. There are two important features of TMPRSS2/ERG fusions. One is that these gene fusions lead to ectopic expression of ERG, an ETS family transcription factor, in prostate epithelial cells from the 5' control region of an androgen/estrogen dual-responsive gene, TMPRSS2; the other is that ~60% of these fusions are generated via intrachromosomal deletion of the interstitial region between TMPRSS2 and ERG. To recapitulate these important aspects of TMPRSS2/ERG fusions, we generated several TMPRSS2/ERG knockin mouse models based on the endogenous Tmprss2 locus. We found that TMPRSS2/ERG represents an early event in prostate tumorigenesis, by sensitizing prostate cells for cooperation with other oncogenic events, such as PTEN-deficiency. We also found that the interstitial region between TMPRSS2 and ERG harbors at least one prostate tumor suppressor, ETS2, whose loss contributes to prostate cancer progression. In this protocol, we describe how these knockin mouse models can be utilized to study roles of TMPRSS2/ERG fusions in prostate cancer development both in vivo and in vitro.	
30734664        	A Reporter System Evaluates Tumorigenesis, Metastasis, β-catenin/MMP Regulation, and Druggability.            	Cancer invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance are the crucial phenomena in cancer malignancy. The high expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is a biomarker as well as a causal factor of cancer invasiveness and metastatic activity. However, a regulatory mechanism underlying MMP9 expression in cancer is not clarified yet. In addition, a new strategy for anticancer drug discovery is becoming an important clue. In the present study, we aimed (i) to develop a novel reporter system evaluating tumorigenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, and druggability with a combination of three-dimensional tumoroid model and Mmp9 promoter and (ii) to examine pharmacological actions of anticancer medications using this reporter system. High expression and genetic amplification of MMP9 were found in colon cancer cases. We found that proximal promoter sequences of MMP9 in murine and human contained conserved binding sites for transcription factors β-catenin/TCF/LEF, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). The murine Mmp9 promoter (-569 to +19) was markedly activated in metastatic colon cancer cells and additionally activated by tumoroid formation and by β-catenin signaling stimulator lithium chloride. The Mmp9 promoter-driven fluorescent reporter cells enabled the monitoring of activities of MMP9/gelatinase, tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis in syngeneic transplantation experiments. We also demonstrated pharmacological actions as follows: dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, steroidal medications binding to GR, inhibited the Mmp9 promoter but did not inhibit tumorigenesis. On the contrary, antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil, a gold standard for colon cancer chemotherapy, inhibited tumoroid formation but did not inhibit Mmp9 promoter activity. Notably, antimalaria medication artesunate inhibited both tumorigenesis and the Mmp9 promoter in vitro, potentially through inhibition of β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling. Thus, this novel reporter system enabled monitoring tumorigenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, key regulatory signalings such as β-catenin/MMP9 axis, and druggability. Impact Statement Cancer invasion and metastasis have been shown to be driven by matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), whose expression mechanism is not clarified yet. In addition, a new strategy for anticancer drug discovery is becoming important. We established a novel reporter system evaluating tumorigenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, and druggability with a combination of three-dimensional (3D) tumoroid model and Mmp9 promoter. Using this reporter system, we demonstrated pharmacological actions of anticancer medications such as antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and antimalaria medication artesunate (ART), which inhibited both tumorigenesis and β-catenin/MMP regulatory signaling. Our study impacts the translational fields of oncology, drug discovery, and organoid model.	
31217166        	KRAS Activation in Gastric Adenocarcinoma Stimulates Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition to Cancer Stem-Like Cells and Promotes Metastasis.            	Our previous work showed that in a mouse model of gastric adenocarcinoma with loss of p53 and Cdh1 that adding oncogenic Kras (a.k.a. Tcon mice) accelerates tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here, we sought to examine KRAS activation in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and generation of cancer stem-like cells (CSC). Transduction of nontransformed HFE-145 gastric epithelial cells with oncogenic KRASG12V significantly decreased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, increased expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and the EMT transcription factor Slug, and increased migration and invasion by 15- to 17-fold. KRASG12V also increased expression of self-renewal proteins such as Sox2 and increased spheroid formation by 2.6-fold. In tumor-derived organoids from Tcon mice, Kras knockdown decreased spheroid formation, expression of EMT-related proteins, migration, and invasion; similar effects, as well as reversal of chemoresistance, were observed following KRAS knockdown or MEK inhibition in patient tumor-derived gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines (AGS and KATOIII). KRAS inhibition in gastric adenocarcinoma spheroid cells led to reduced AGS flank xenograft growth, loss of the infiltrative tumor border, fewer lung metastases, and increased survival. In a tissue microarray of human gastric adenocarcinomas from 115 patients, high tumor levels of CD44 (a marker of CSCs) and KRAS activation were independent predictors of worse overall survival. In conclusion, KRAS activation in gastric adenocarcinoma cells stimulates EMT and transition to CSCs, thus promoting metastasis. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides rationale for examining inhibitors of KRAS to block metastasis and reverse chemotherapy resistance in gastric adenocarcinoma patients.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31439587        	PARP Inhibition Suppresses GR-MYCN-CDK5-RB1-E2F1 Signaling and Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.            	In this study, we addressed the underlying mechanisms for the association between enzalutamide (ENZ) treatment and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), and the critical involvement of MYCN, and loss of RB1 function in neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of prostatic epithelial cells, and the development of NEPC. We further sought to determine whether PARP inhibition could suppress NEPC, and to identify molecular determinants of this therapeutic activity.                We used a novel prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) treatment model, prostatic adenocarcinoma and NEPC cell lines, an NEPC organoid line, and NEPC xenograft models to address the mechanistic basis of ENZ-induced NED, and to analyze suppression of NED and NEPC growth by PARP inhibition.                We identified an ENZ treatment-associated glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-MYCN-CDK5-RB1-E2F1 signaling pathway that drives NED in prostatic adenocarcinoma PDX and cell line models. Mechanistically, long-term ENZ treatment transcriptionally upregulates signaling of the GR-MYCN axis, leading to CDK5R1 and CDK5R2 upregulation, Rb1 phosphorylation, and N-Myc-mediated and E2F1-mediated NED gene expression. Importantly, olaparib (OLA) or talazoparib (TALA) suppressed these activities, and the combination of OLA and dinaciclib (DINA), an inhibitor of CDK2 and CDK5, which also inhibits Rb1 phosphorylation, suppressed NED and significantly improved therapeutic efficiency in NEPC cells in vitro and in NEPC tumors in vivo.                The results of our study indicate an important role of GR-MYCN-CDK5R1/2-RB1-NED signaling in ENZ-induced and PARP inhibitor-suppressed NEPC. We also demonstrated efficacy for OLA+DINA combination therapy in NEPC xenograft models.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
33665961        	Combination therapies induce cancer cell death through the integrated stress response and disturbed pyrimidine metabolism.            	By accentuating drug efficacy and impeding resistance mechanisms, combinatorial, multi-agent therapies have emerged as key approaches in the treatment of complex diseases, most notably cancer. Using high-throughput drug screens, we uncovered distinct metabolic vulnerabilities and thereby identified drug combinations synergistically causing a starvation-like lethal catabolic response in tumor cells from different cancer entities. Domperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist, as well as several tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), including imipramine, induced cancer cell death in combination with the mitochondrial uncoupler niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN) through activation of the integrated stress response pathway and the catabolic CLEAR network. Using transcriptome and metabolome analyses, we characterized a combinatorial response, mainly driven by the transcription factors CHOP and TFE3, which resulted in cell death through enhanced pyrimidine catabolism as well as reduced pyrimidine synthesis. Remarkably, the drug combinations sensitized human organoid cultures to the standard-of-care chemotherapy paclitaxel. Thus, our combinatorial approach could be clinically implemented into established treatment regimen, which would be further facilitated by the advantages of drug repurposing.                © 2021 The Authors.

31543862        	The Role of Thyroid Hormones in Hepatocyte Proliferation and Liver Cancer.            	Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (thyroxine) control a wide variety of effects related to development, differentiation, growth and metabolism, through their interaction with nuclear receptors. But thyroid hormones also produce non-genomic effects that typically start at the plasma membrane and are mediated mainly by integrin αvβ3, although other receptors such as TRα and TRβ are also able to elicit non-genomic responses. In the liver, the effects of thyroid hormones appear to be particularly important. The liver is able to regenerate, but it is subject to pathologies that may lead to cancer, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition, cancer cells undergo a reprogramming of their metabolism, resulting in drastic changes such as aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation. As a consequence, the pyruvate kinase isoform M2, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is dysregulated, and this is considered an important factor in tumorigenesis. Redox equilibrium is also important, in fact cancer cells give rise to the production of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than normal cells. This increase may favor the survival and propagation of cancer cells. We evaluate the possible mechanisms involving the plasma membrane receptor integrin αvβ3 that may lead to cancer progression. Studying diseases that affect the liver and their experimental models may help to unravel the cellular pathways mediated by integrin αvβ3 that can lead to liver cancer. Inhibitors of integrin αvβ3 might represent a future therapeutic tool against liver cancer. We also include information on the possible role of exosomes in liver cancer, as well as on recent strategies such as organoids and spheroids, which may provide a new tool for research, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.	
29415581        	A new approach to assess drug sensitivity in cells for novel drug discovery.            	There is a pressing need to improve strategies to select candidate drugs early on in the drug development pipeline, especially in oncology, as the efficiency of new drug approval has steadily declined these past years. Traditional methods of drug screening have relied on low-cost assays on cancer cell lines growing on plastic dishes. Recent massive-scale screens have generated big data amenable for sophisticated computational modeling and integration with clinical data. However, 2D culturing has several intrinsic limitations and novel methodologies have been devised for culturing in three dimensions, to include cells from the tumor immune microenvironment. These major improvements are bringing in vitro systems even closer to a physiological, more clinically relevant state. Areas covered: In this article, the authors review the literature on methodologies for early-phase drug screening, focusing on in vitro systems and analyzing both novel experimental and statistical approaches. The article does not cover the expanding literature on in vivo systems. Expert opinion: The popularity of three-dimensional systems is exploding, driven by the development of 'organoid' derivation technology in 2009. These assays are growing in sophistication to accommodate the increasing need by modern oncology to develop drugs that target the microenvironment.	
30832308        	Tridimensional Retinoblastoma Cultures as Vitreous Seeds Models for Live-Cell Imaging of Chemotherapy Penetration.            	A preclinical model could aid in understanding retinoblastoma vitreous seeds behavior, drug penetration, and response to chemotherapy to optimize patient treatment. Our aim was to develop a tridimensional in vitro model of retinoblastoma vitreous seeds to assess chemotherapy penetration by means of live-cell imaging. Cell cultures from patients with retinoblastoma who underwent upfront enucleation were established and thoroughly characterized for authentication of human tumor origin. The correlation of the in vitro tridimensional structures resembling human spheres and dusts vitreous seeds was established. Confocal microscopy was used to quantify real-time fluorescence of topotecan as a measure of its penetration into different sizes of spheres. Cell viability was determined after chemotherapy penetration. The in vitro spheres and dusts models were able to recapitulate the morphology, phenotype, and genotype of patient vitreous seeds. The larger the size of the spheres, the longer the time required for the drug to fully penetrate into the core (p < 0.05). Importantly, topotecan penetration correlated with its cytotoxic activity. Therefore, the studied tridimensional cell model recapitulated several characteristics of vitreous seeds observed in patients with retinoblastoma and were successfully used to assess live-cell imaging of chemotherapy penetration for drug distribution studies.

The majority of colorectal cancers show hyperactivated WNT signaling due to inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor. Genetically restoring APC suppresses WNT and induces rapid and sustained tumor regression, implying that reengaging this endogenous tumor-suppressive mechanism may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Here, using new animal models, human cell lines, and ex vivo organoid cultures, we show that tankyrase (TNKS) inhibition can control WNT hyperactivation and provide long-term tumor control in vivo, but that effective responses are critically dependent on how APC is disrupted. Mutant APC proteins truncated within the mutation cluster region physically engage the destruction complex and suppress the WNT transcriptional program, while APC variants with early truncations (e.g., ApcMin) show limited interaction with AXIN1 and β-catenin, and do not respond to TNKS blockade. Together, this work shows that TNKS inhibition, like APC restoration, can reestablish endogenous control of WNT/β-catenin signaling, but that APC genotype is a crucial determinant of this response. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals how subtle changes to the mutations in a critical colorectal tumor suppressor, APC, influence the cellular response to a targeted therapy. It underscores how investigating the specific genetic alterations that occur in human cancer can identify important biological mechanisms of drug response and resistance.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1325.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30283134        	Multi-axial self-organization properties of mouse embryonic stem cells into gastruloids.            	The emergence of multiple axes is an essential element in the establishment of the mammalian body plan. This process takes place shortly after implantation of the embryo within the uterus and relies on the activity of gene regulatory networks that coordinate transcription in space and time. Whereas genetic approaches have revealed important aspects of these processes1, a mechanistic understanding is hampered by the poor experimental accessibility of early post-implantation stages. Here we show that small aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), when stimulated to undergo gastrulation-like events and elongation in vitro, can organize a post-occipital pattern of neural, mesodermal and endodermal derivatives that mimic embryonic spatial and temporal gene expression. The establishment of the three major body axes in these 'gastruloids'2,3 suggests that the mechanisms involved are interdependent. Specifically, gastruloids display the hallmarks of axial gene regulatory systems as exemplified by the implementation of collinear Hox transcriptional patterns along an extending antero-posterior axis. These results reveal an unanticipated self-organizing capacity of aggregated ESCs and suggest that gastruloids could be used as a complementary system to study early developmental events in the mammalian embryo.	
32963006        	Genotoxic Effect of Salmonella Paratyphi A Infection on Human Primary Gallbladder Cells.            	Carcinoma of the gallbladder (GBC) is the most frequent tumor of the biliary tract. Despite epidemiological studies showing a correlation between chronic infection with Salmonella enterica Typhi/Paratyphi A and GBC, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this fatal connection are still uncertain. The murine serovar Salmonella Typhimurium has been shown to promote transformation of genetically predisposed cells by driving mitogenic signaling. However, insights from this strain remain limited as it lacks the typhoid toxin produced by the human serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A. In particular, the CdtB subunit of the typhoid toxin directly induces DNA breaks in host cells, likely promoting transformation. To assess the underlying principles of transformation, we used gallbladder organoids as an infection model for Salmonella Paratyphi A. In this model, bacteria can invade epithelial cells, and we observed host cell DNA damage. The induction of DNA double-strand breaks after infection depended on the typhoid toxin CdtB subunit and extended to neighboring, non-infected cells. By cultivating the organoid derived cells into polarized monolayers in air-liquid interphase, we could extend the duration of the infection, and we observed an initial arrest of the cell cycle that does not depend on the typhoid toxin. Non-infected intoxicated cells instead continued to proliferate despite the DNA damage. Our study highlights the importance of the typhoid toxin in causing genomic instability and corroborates the epidemiological link between Salmonella infection and GBC.IMPORTANCE Bacterial infections are increasingly being recognized as risk factors for the development of adenocarcinomas. The strong epidemiological evidence linking Helicobacter pylori infection to stomach cancer has paved the way to the demonstration that bacterial infections cause DNA damage in the host cells, initiating transformation. In this regard, the role of bacterial genotoxins has become more relevant. Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A have been clinically associated with gallbladder cancer. By harnessing the stem cell potential of cells from healthy human gallbladder explant, we regenerated and propagated the epithelium of this organ in vitro and used these cultures to model S. Paratyphi A infection. This study demonstrates the importance of the typhoid toxin, encoded only by these specific serovars, in causing genomic instability in healthy gallbladder cells, posing intoxicated cells at risk of malignant transformation.

29130932        	p120-Catenin is an obligate haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in intestinal neoplasia.            	p120-Catenin (p120) functions as a tumor suppressor in intestinal cancer, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, using conditional p120 knockout in Apc-sensitized mouse models of intestinal cancer, we have identified p120 as an "obligatory" haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Whereas monoallelic loss of p120 was associated with a significant increase in tumor multiplicity, loss of both alleles was never observed in tumors from these mice. Moreover, forced ablation of the second allele did not further enhance tumorigenesis, but instead induced synthetic lethality in combination with Apc loss of heterozygosity. In tumor-derived organoid cultures, elimination of both p120 alleles resulted in caspase-3-dependent apoptosis that was blocked by inhibition of Rho kinase (ROCK). With ROCK inhibition, however, p120-ablated organoids exhibited a branching phenotype and a substantial increase in cell proliferation. Access to data from Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis screens afforded an opportunity to directly assess the tumorigenic impact of p120 haploinsufficiency relative to other candidate drivers. Remarkably, p120 ranked third among the 919 drivers identified. Cofactors α-catenin and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) were also among the highest scoring candidates, indicating a mechanism at the level of the intact complex that may play an important role at very early stages of of intestinal tumorigenesis while simultaneously restricting outright loss via synthetic lethality.	
33362787        	3D Tumor Models and Their Use for the Testing of Immunotherapies.            	Over the past decade, immunotherapy has become a powerful and evident tool in the fight against cancers. Notably, the rise of checkpoint blockade using monoclonal antibodies (anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1) to avoid interaction between inhibitory molecules allowed the betterment of patient care. Indeed, immunotherapies led to increased overall survival in forms of cutaneous melanoma or lung cancer. However, the percentage of patients responding varies from 20 to 40% depending on the type of cancer and on the expression of the target molecules by the tumor. This is due to the tumor microenvironment which allows the acquisition of resistance mechanisms to immunotherapies by tumor cells. These are closely linked to the architecture and cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment. This one acts on different parameters such as the immune cells infiltrate its composition and therefore, favors the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells as well as the tumor expression of checkpoint inhibitors such as Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1). Therefore, the analysis and modeling of the complexity of the microenvironment is an important parameter to consider, not only in the search for new therapies but also for the identification and stratification of patients likely to respond to immunotherapy. This is why the use of 3D culture models, reflecting the architecture and cellular composition of a tumor, is essential in immuno-oncology studies. Nowadays, there are several 3-D culture methods such as spheroids and organoids, which are applicable to immuno-oncology. In this review we evaluate 3D culture models as tools for the development of treatments in the field of immuno-oncology.                Copyright © 2020 Boucherit, Gorvel and Olive.	
28659499        	Intersections of lung progenitor cells, lung disease and lung cancer.            	The use of stem cell biology approaches to study adult lung progenitor cells and lung cancer has brought a variety of new techniques to the field of lung biology and has elucidated new pathways that may be therapeutic targets in lung cancer. Recent results have begun to identify the ways in which different cell populations interact to regulate progenitor activity, and this has implications for the interventions that are possible in cancer and in a variety of lung diseases. Today's better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate lung progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation, including understanding how multiple epigenetic factors affect lung injury repair, holds the promise for future better treatments for lung cancer and for optimising the response to therapy in lung cancer. Working between platforms in sophisticated organoid culture techniques, genetically engineered mouse models of injury and cancer, and human cell lines and specimens, lung progenitor cell studies can begin with basic biology, progress to translational research and finally lead to the beginnings of clinical trials.

29108585        	Using bead injection to model dispensing of 3-D multicellular spheroids into microtiter plates.            	Biomedical translational research has relied on two dimensional (2D) cell cultures for drug discovery over the decades, requiring cells to grow on a flat surface which does not always accurately model in vivo biological states. Three dimensional (3D) cell cultures, also known as 3D spheroids or organoids, grow as cellular tissues that are more physiologically relevant especially with respect to emulating cancer tumor-like structures [1]. While attractive, current methods for generating 3D spheroids has yet to replace 2D culturing methods used for drug discovery efforts that employ high-throughput screening (HTS), having limitations with scalability, reproducibility, and compatibility predominantly associated with conventional microtiter plate usage. Presented is a novel use of bead injection for the reproducible placement of spheroids and beads into high density microtiter plates of a 384- and 1536- well format.

33219048        	RNA-binding protein RALY reprogrammes mitochondrial metabolism via mediating miRNA processing in colorectal cancer.            	Dysregulated cellular metabolism is a distinct hallmark of human colorectal cancer (CRC). However, metabolic programme rewiring during tumour progression has yet to be fully understood.                We analysed altered gene signatures during colorectal tumour progression, and used a complex of molecular and metabolic assays to study the regulation of metabolism in CRC cell lines, human patient-derived xenograft mouse models and tumour organoid models.                We identified a novel RNA-binding protein, RALY (also known as hnRNPCL2), that is highly associated with colorectal tumour aggressiveness. RALY acts as a key regulatory component in the Drosha complex, and promotes the post-transcriptional processing of a specific subset of miRNAs (miR-483, miR-676 and miR-877). These miRNAs systematically downregulate the expression of the metabolism-associated genes (ATP5I, ATP5G1, ATP5G3 and CYC1) and thereby reprogramme mitochondrial metabolism in the cancer cell. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that increased levels of RALY are associated with poor prognosis in the patients with CRC expressing low levels of mitochondrion-associated genes. Mechanistically, induced processing of these miRNAs is facilitated by their N6-methyladenosine switch under reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. Inhibition of the m6A methylation abolishes the RALY recognition of the terminal loop of the pri-miRNAs. Knockdown of RALY inhibits colorectal tumour growth and progression in vivo and in organoid models.                Collectively, our results reveal a critical metabolism-centric role of RALY in tumour progression, which may lead to cancer therapeutics targeting RALY for treating CRC.                © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

29572236        	PTEN Deficiency and AMPK Activation Promote Nutrient Scavenging and Anabolism in Prostate Cancer Cells.            	We report that PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells use macropinocytosis to survive and proliferate under nutrient stress. PTEN loss increased macropinocytosis only in the context of AMPK activation, revealing a general requirement for AMPK in macropinocytosis and a novel mechanism by which AMPK promotes survival under stress. In prostate cancer cells, albumin uptake did not require macropinocytosis, but necrotic cell debris proved a specific macropinocytic cargo. Isotopic labeling confirmed that macropinocytosed necrotic cell proteins fueled new protein synthesis in prostate cancer cells. Supplementation with necrotic debris, but not albumin, also maintained lipid stores, suggesting that macropinocytosis can supply nutrients other than amino acids. Nontransformed prostatic epithelial cells were not macropinocytic, but patient-derived prostate cancer organoids and xenografts and autochthonous prostate tumors all exhibited constitutive macropinocytosis, and blocking macropinocytosis limited prostate tumor growth. Macropinocytosis of extracellular material by prostate cancer cells is a previously unappreciated tumor-microenvironment interaction that could be targeted therapeutically.Significance: As PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells proliferate in low-nutrient environments by scavenging necrotic debris and extracellular protein via macropinocytosis, blocking macropinocytosis by inhibiting AMPK, RAC1, or PI3K may have therapeutic value, particularly in necrotic tumors and in combination with therapies that cause nutrient stress.

28746017        	Tumor Evolution, Heterogeneity, and Therapy for Our Patients With Advanced Cancer: How Far Have We Come?            	The clinical and molecular heterogeneity of various cancer types is well documented. In the era of precision oncology whereby molecular profiling of tumors is incorporated into clinical care, both intra- and intertumoral molecular and genetic heterogeneity have been described. Together, they impact patient treatment and outcomes. Host genetics and the tumor microenvironment impact on tumor evolution and heterogeneity through variations in immune cell infiltration, stromal variations, and selection pressures from hypoxia or nutrient stress, among others. Tumor progression and exposure to therapeutic agents lead to further molecular evolution and heterogeneity that is clinically relevant. Moreover, tumors that evolve after diagnosis and as a function of therapy generally become more aggressive and refractory to available therapeutics, including targeted agents and immunotherapy. The evolving clinical and molecular heterogeneity of patient tumors can be explored with various clinical and research-based specimens and testing such as pre- and post-treatment biopsies; serial liquid biopsies; single cell analysis; PDX and organoid models; anatomic, functional, and molecular imaging; and rapid postmortem studies. Other factors that influence tumor heterogeneity include immune checkpoints, cancer stem cells, therapy-acquired resistance mechanisms that may occur through secondary mutations, and adaptive responses. Modern technologic advances for tumor characterization provide opportunities to understand tumor evolution and its impact on clinical outcomes to improve therapeutic regimens. Characterization of novel targets and development of effective therapeutics are needed to target heterogeneity and the evolution of resistance mechanisms.	
33144576        	Role of specialized composition of SWI/SNF complexes in prostate cancer lineage plasticity.            	Advanced prostate cancer initially responds to hormonal treatment, but ultimately becomes resistant and requires more potent therapies. One mechanism of resistance observed in around 10-20% of these patients is lineage plasticity, which manifests in a partial or complete small cell or neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) phenotype. Here, we investigate the role of the mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex in NEPC. Using large patient datasets, patient-derived organoids and cancer cell lines, we identify mSWI/SNF subunits that are deregulated in NEPC and demonstrate that SMARCA4 (BRG1) overexpression is associated with aggressive disease. We also show that SWI/SNF complexes interact with different lineage-specific factors in NEPC compared to prostate adenocarcinoma. These data point to a role for mSWI/SNF complexes in therapy-related lineage plasticity, which may also be relevant for other solid tumors.	
33626231        	Druggable genome and precision medicine in cancer: current challenges.            	The past decades have seen tremendous developments with respect to "specific" therapeutics that target key signaling molecules to conquer cancer. The key advancements with multiomics technologies, especially genomics, have allowed physicians and molecular oncologists to design "tailor-made" solutions to the specific oncogenes that are deregulated in individual patients, a strategy which has turned out to be successful though the patients quickly develop resistance. The swift integration of multidisciplinary approaches has led to the development of "next generation" therapeutics and, with synergistic therapeutic regimes combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors to reactivate the dampened immune response, have provided the much needed promise for cancer patients. Despite these advances, a large portion of the druggable genome remains understudied, and the role of druggable genome in the immune system needs further attention. Establishment of patient derived organoid models have fastened the preclinical validation of novel therapeutics for swift clinical translation. We summarized the current advances and challenges, and also stress the importance of biobanking and collection of longitudinal data sets with structured clinical information, as well as the critical role these "high content data sets" will play in designing new therapeutic regimes in a tailor made fashion.

32198200        	Clostridioides difficile infection damages colonic stem cells via TcdB, impairing epithelial repair and recovery from disease.            	Gastrointestinal infections often induce epithelial damage that must be repaired for optimal gut function. While intestinal stem cells are critical for this regeneration process [R. C. van der Wath, B. S. Gardiner, A. W. Burgess, D. W. Smith, PLoS One 8, e73204 (2013); S. Kozar et al., Cell Stem Cell 13, 626-633 (2013)], how they are impacted by enteric infections remains poorly defined. Here, we investigate infection-mediated damage to the colonic stem cell compartment and how this affects epithelial repair and recovery from infection. Using the pathogen Clostridioides difficile, we show that infection disrupts murine intestinal cellular organization and integrity deep into the epithelium, to expose the otherwise protected stem cell compartment, in a TcdB-mediated process. Exposure and susceptibility of colonic stem cells to intoxication compromises their function during infection, which diminishes their ability to repair the injured epithelium, shown by altered stem cell signaling and a reduction in the growth of colonic organoids from stem cells isolated from infected mice. We also show, using both mouse and human colonic organoids, that TcdB from epidemic ribotype 027 strains does not require Frizzled 1/2/7 binding to elicit this dysfunctional stem cell state. This stem cell dysfunction induces a significant delay in recovery and repair of the intestinal epithelium of up to 2 wk post the infection peak. Our results uncover a mechanism by which an enteric pathogen subverts repair processes by targeting stem cells during infection and preventing epithelial regeneration, which prolongs epithelial barrier impairment and creates an environment in which disease recurrence is likely.	
28151470        	Adipocytes activate mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and autophagy to promote tumor growth in colon cancer.            	Obesity has been associated with increased incidence and mortality of a wide variety of human cancers including colorectal cancer. However, the molecular mechanism by which adipocytes regulate the metabolism of colon cancer cells remains elusive. In this study, we showed that adipocytes isolated from adipose tissues of colon cancer patients have an important role in modulating cellular metabolism to support tumor growth and survival. Abundant adipocytes were found in close association with invasive tumor cells in colon cancer patients. Co-culture of adipocytes with colon cancer cells led to a transfer of free fatty acids that released from the adipocytes to the cancer cells. Uptake of fatty acids allowed the cancer cells to survive nutrient deprivation conditions by upregulating mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. Mechanistically, co-culture of adipocytes or treating cells with fatty acids induced autophagy in colon cancer cells as a result of AMPK activation. Inhibition of autophagy attenuated the ability of cancer cells to utilize fatty acids and blocked the growth-promoting effect of adipocytes. In addition, we found that adipocytes stimulated the expression of genes associated with cancer stem cells and downregulated genes associated with intestinal epithelial cell differentiation in primary colon cancer cells and mouse tumor organoids. Importantly, the presence of adipocytes promoted the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo. Taken together, our results show that adipocytes in the tumor microenvironment serve as an energy provider and a metabolic regulator to promote the growth and survival of colon cancer cells.

30181180        	p63-Dependent Dickkopf3 Expression Promotes Esophageal Cancer Cell Proliferation via CKAP4.            	Dickkopf3 (DKK3) is a secretory protein that belongs to the DKK family, but exhibits structural divergence from other family members, and its corresponding receptors remain to be identified. Although DKK3 has been shown to have oncogenic functions in certain cancer types, the underlying mechanism by which DKK3 promotes tumorigenesis remains to be clarified. We show here that DKK3 stimulates esophageal cancer cell proliferation via cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4), which acts as a receptor for DKK3. DKK3 was expressed in approximately 50% of tumor lesions of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases; simultaneous expression of DKK3 and CKAP4 was associated with poor prognosis. Anti-CKAP4 antibody inhibited both binding of DKK3 to CKAP4 and xenograft tumor formation induced by ESCC cells. p63, a p53-related transcriptional factor frequently amplified in ESCC, bound to the upstream region of the DKK3 gene. Knockdown of p63 decreased DKK3 expression in ESCC cells, and reexpression of DKK3 partially rescued cell proliferation in p63-depleted ESCC cells. Expression of ΔNp63α and DKK3 increased the size of tumor-like esophageal organoids, and anti-CKAP4 antibody inhibited growth of esophageal organoids. Taken together, these results suggest that the DKK3-CKAP4 axis might serve as a novel molecular target for ESCC.Significance: In esophageal cancer, findings identify DKK3 as a poor prognostic indicator and demonstrate CKAP4 inhibition as an effective therapeutic strategy.

25312954        	Effects of Shiga toxin type 2 on a bioengineered three-dimensional model of human renal tissue.            	Shiga toxins (Stx) are a family of cytotoxic proteins that can cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a thrombotic microangiopathy, following infections by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Renal failure is a key feature of HUS and a major cause of childhood renal failure worldwide. There are currently no specific therapies for STEC-associated HUS, and the mechanism of Stx-induced renal injury is not well understood primarily due to a lack of fully representative animal models and an inability to monitor disease progression on a molecular or cellular level in humans at early stages. Three-dimensional (3D) tissue models have been shown to be more in vivo-like in their phenotype and physiology than 2D cultures for numerous disease models, including cancer and polycystic kidney disease. It is unknown whether exposure of a 3D renal tissue model to Stx will yield a more in vivo-like response than 2D cell culture. In this study, we characterized Stx2-mediated cytotoxicity in a bioengineered 3D human renal tissue model previously shown to be a predictor of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and compared its response to Stx2 exposure in 2D cell culture. Our results demonstrate that although many mechanistic aspects of cytotoxicity were similar between 3D and 2D, treatment of the 3D tissues with Stx resulted in an elevated secretion of the kidney injury marker 1 (Kim-1) and the cytokine interleukin-8 compared to the 2D cell cultures. This study represents the first application of 3D tissues for the study of Stx-mediated kidney injury.                 Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.	
33406413        	Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation by MicroRNA-194 Promotes Neuroendocrine Transdifferentiation in Prostate Cancer.            	Potent therapeutic inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate adenocarcinoma can lead to the emergence of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a phenomenon associated with enhanced cell plasticity. Here, we show that microRNA-194 (miR-194) is a regulator of epithelial-neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. In clinical prostate cancer samples, miR-194 expression and activity were elevated in NEPC and inversely correlated with AR signaling. miR-194 facilitated the emergence of neuroendocrine features in prostate cancer cells, a process mediated by its ability to directly target a suite of genes involved in cell plasticity. One such target was FOXA1, which encodes a transcription factor with a vital role in maintaining the prostate epithelial lineage. Importantly, a miR-194 inhibitor blocked epithelial-neuroendocrine transdifferentiation and inhibited the growth of cell lines and patient-derived organoids possessing neuroendocrine features. Overall, our study reveals a post-transcriptional mechanism regulating the plasticity of prostate cancer cells and provides a rationale for targeting miR-194 in NEPC.

28745637        	Isolation of Circulating Tumor Cells in an Orthotopic Mouse Model of Colorectal Cancer.            	Despite the advantages of easy applicability and cost-effectiveness, subcutaneous mouse models have severe limitations and do not accurately simulate tumor biology and tumor cell dissemination. Orthotopic mouse models have been introduced to overcome these limitations; however, such models are technically demanding, especially in hollow organs such as the large bowel. In order to produce uniform tumors which reliably grow and metastasize, standardized techniques of tumor cell preparation and injection are critical. We have developed an orthotopic mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC) which develops highly uniform tumors and can be used for tumor biology studies as well as therapeutic trials. Tumor cells from either primary tumors, 2-dimensional (2D) cell lines or 3-dimensional (3D) organoids are injected into the cecum and, depending on the metastatic potential of the injected tumor cells, form highly metastatic tumors. In addition, CTCs can be found regularly. We here describe the technique of tumor cell preparation from both 2D cell lines and 3D organoids as well as primary tumor tissue, the surgical and injection techniques as well as the isolation of CTCs from the tumor-bearing mice, and present tips for troubleshooting.	
31980631        	FICD activity and AMPylation remodelling modulate human neurogenesis.            	Posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins represents an important cellular mechanism for controlling diverse functions such as signalling, localisation or protein-protein interactions. AMPylation (also termed adenylylation) has recently been discovered as a prevalent PTM for regulating protein activity. In human cells AMPylation has been exclusively studied with the FICD protein. Here we investigate the role of AMPylation in human neurogenesis by introducing a cell-permeable propargyl adenosine pronucleotide probe to infiltrate cellular AMPylation pathways and report distinct modifications in intact cancer cell lines, human-derived stem cells, neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neurons and cerebral organoids (COs) via LC-MS/MS as well as imaging methods. A total of 162 AMP modified proteins were identified. FICD-dependent AMPylation remodelling accelerates differentiation of neural progenitor cells into mature neurons in COs, demonstrating a so far unknown trigger of human neurogenesis.	
32066735        	Inhibiting WNT and NOTCH in renal cancer stem cells and the implications for human patients.            	Current treatments for clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) are insufficient because two-thirds of patients with metastases progress within two years. Here we report the identification and characterization of a cancer stem cell (CSC) population in ccRCC. CSCs are quantitatively correlated with tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. Transcriptional profiling and single cell sequencing reveal that these CSCs exhibit an activation of WNT and NOTCH signaling. A significant obstacle to the development of rational treatments has been the discrepancy between model systems and the in vivo situation of patients. To address this, we use CSCs to establish non-adherent sphere cultures, 3D tumor organoids, and xenografts. Treatment with WNT and NOTCH inhibitors blocks the proliferation and self-renewal of CSCs in sphere cultures and organoids, and impairs tumor growth in patient-derived xenografts in mice. These findings suggest that our approach is a promising route towards the development of personalized treatments for individual patients.	
28504653        	Metabolic shifts in residual breast cancer drive tumor recurrence.            	Tumor recurrence is the leading cause of breast cancer-related death. Recurrences are largely driven by cancer cells that survive therapeutic intervention. This poorly understood population is referred to as minimal residual disease. Here, using mouse models that faithfully recapitulate human disease together with organoid cultures, we have demonstrated that residual cells acquire a transcriptionally distinct state from normal epithelium and primary tumors. Gene expression changes and functional characterization revealed altered lipid metabolism and elevated ROS as hallmarks of the cells that survive tumor regression. These residual cells exhibited increased oxidative DNA damage, potentiating the acquisition of somatic mutations during hormonal-induced expansion of the mammary cell population. Inhibition of either cellular fatty acid synthesis or fatty acid transport into mitochondria reduced cellular ROS levels and DNA damage, linking these features to lipid metabolism. Direct perturbation of these hallmarks in vivo, either by scavenging ROS or by halting the cyclic mammary cell population expansion, attenuated tumor recurrence. Finally, these observations were mirrored in transcriptomic and histological signatures of residual cancer cells from neoadjuvant-treated breast cancer patients. These results highlight the potential of lipid metabolism and ROS as therapeutic targets for reducing tumor recurrence in breast cancer patients.	
33585202        	Searching for a Putative Mechanism of RIZ2 Tumor-Promoting Function in Cancer Models.            	Positive Regulatory Domain (PRDM) gene family members commonly express two main molecular variants, the PR-plus isoform usually acting as tumor suppressor and the PR-minus one functioning as oncogene. Accordingly, PRDM2/RIZ encodes for RIZ1 (PR-plus) and RIZ2 (PR-minus). In human cancers, genetic or epigenetic modifications induce RIZ1 silencing with an expression level imbalance in favor of RIZ2 that could be relevant for tumorigenesis. Additionally, in estrogen target cells and tissues, estradiol increases RIZ2 expression level with concurrent increase of cell proliferation and survival. Several attempts to study RIZ2 function in HeLa or MCF-7 cells by its over-expression were unsuccessful. Thus, we over-expressed RIZ2 in HEK-293 cells, which are both RIZ1 and RIZ2 positive but unresponsive to estrogens. The forced RIZ2 expression increased cell viability and growth, prompted the G2-to-M phase transition and organoids formation. Accordingly, microarray analysis revealed that RIZ2 regulates several genes involved in mitosis. Consistently, RIZ silencing in both estrogen-responsive MCF-7 and -unresponsive MDA-MB-231 cells induced a reduction of cell proliferation and an increase of apoptosis rate. Our findings add novel insights on the putative RIZ2 tumor-promoting functions, although additional attempts are warranted to depict the underlying molecular mechanism.

28629429        	Linked read sequencing resolves complex genomic rearrangements in gastric cancer metastases.            	Genome rearrangements are critical oncogenic driver events in many malignancies. However, the identification and resolution of the structure of cancer genomic rearrangements remain challenging even with whole genome sequencing.                To identify oncogenic genomic rearrangements and resolve their structure, we analyzed linked read sequencing. This approach relies on a microfluidic droplet technology to produce libraries derived from single, high molecular weight DNA molecules, 50 kb in size or greater. After sequencing, the barcoded sequence reads provide long range genomic information, identify individual high molecular weight DNA molecules, determine the haplotype context of genetic variants that occur across contiguous megabase-length segments of the genome and delineate the structure of complex rearrangements. We applied linked read sequencing of whole genomes to the analysis of a set of synchronous metastatic diffuse gastric cancers that occurred in the same individual.                When comparing metastatic sites, our analysis implicated a complex somatic rearrangement that was present in the metastatic tumor. The oncogenic event associated with the identified complex rearrangement resulted in an amplification of the known cancer driver gene FGFR2. With further investigation using these linked read data, the FGFR2 copy number alteration was determined to be a deletion-inversion motif that underwent tandem duplication, with unique breakpoints in each metastasis. Using a three-dimensional organoid tissue model, we functionally validated the metastatic potential of an FGFR2 amplification in gastric cancer.                Our study demonstrates that linked read sequencing is useful in characterizing oncogenic rearrangements in cancer metastasis.	
24308963        	Wnt signaling in adult intestinal stem cells and cancer.            	Signaling initiated by secreted glycoproteins of the Wnt family regulates many aspects of embryonic development and it is involved in homeostasis of adult tissues. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract the Wnt pathway maintains the self-renewal capacity of epithelial stem cells. The stem cell attributes are conferred by mutual interactions of the stem cell with its local microenvironment, the stem cell niche. The niche ensures that the threshold of Wnt signaling in the stem cell is kept in physiological range. In addition, the Wnt pathway involves various feedback loops that balance the opposing processes of cell proliferation and differentiation. Today, we have compelling evidence that mutations causing aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway promote expansion of undifferentiated progenitors and lead to cancer. The review summarizes recent advances in characterization of adult epithelial stem cells in the gut. We mainly focus on discoveries related to molecular mechanisms regulating the output of the Wnt pathway. Moreover, we present novel experimental approaches utilized to investigate the epithelial cell signaling circuitry in vivo and in vitro. Pivotal aspects of tissue homeostasis are often deduced from studies of tumor cells; therefore, we also discuss some latest results gleaned from the deep genome sequencing studies of human carcinomas of the colon and rectum.

32622019        	Spatiotemporally tracking of nano-biofilaments inside the nuclear pore complex core.            	Nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a gating nanomachine with a central selective barrier composed mainly of Nups, which contain intrinsically disordered (non-structured) regions (IDRs) with phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motifs (FG-NUPs). The NPC central FG network dynamics is poorly understood, as FG-NUPs liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have evaded structural characterization. Moreover, the working mechanism of single FG-NUP-biofilaments residing at the central lumen is unknown. In general, flexible biofilaments are expected to be tangled and knotted during their motion and interaction. However, filament knotting visualization in real-time and space has yet to be visualized at the nanoscale. Here, we report a spatiotemporally tracking method for FG-NUP organization with nanoscale resolution, unveiling FG-NUP conformation in NPCs of colorectal cells and organoids at timescales of ~150 ms using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Tracking of FG-NUP single filaments revealed that single filaments have a heterogeneous thickness in normal and cancer models which in turn affected the filament rotation and motion. Notably, FG-NUPs are overexpressed in various cancers. Using the FG-NUP inhibitor, trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol, we found that central plug size was significantly reduced and incompletely reversible back to filamentous structures in aggressive colon cancer cells and organoids. These data showed a model of FG-NUPs reversible self-assembly devolving into the central plug partial biogenesis. Taken together, HS-AFM enabled the tracking and manipulation of single filaments of native FG-NUPs which has remained evasive for decades.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

32868298        	Tumor-Resident Stromal Cells Promote Breast Cancer Invasion through Regulation of the Basal Phenotype.            	Collective invasion can be led by breast cancer cells expressing basal epithelial markers, typified by keratin-14 (KRT14). We analyzed gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and demonstrated a significant correlation between a KRT14+ invasion signature and a stromal-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) organization module. We then developed a novel coculture model of tumor organoids with autologous stromal cells. Coculture significantly increased KRT14 expression and invasion of organoids from both luminal and basal murine breast cancer models. However, stromal cell conditioned medium induced invasion but not KRT14 expression. Cancer cells released TGFβ and that signaling pathway was required for stromal cell-induced invasion and KRT14 expression. Mechanistically, TGFβ induced NOX4 expression in stromal cells and NOX4 inhibition reduced invasion and KRT14 expression. In summary, we developed a novel coculture model and revealed dynamic molecular interactions between stromal cells and cancer cells that regulate both basal gene expression and invasive behavior. IMPLICATIONS: Fibroblasts within mammary tumors can regulate the molecular phenotype and invasive behavior of breast cancer cells.

31235784        	Activation of IGF1R by DARPP-32 promotes STAT3 signaling in gastric cancer cells.            	Dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32000 (DARPP-32), is frequently overexpressed in early stages of gastric cancers. We utilized in vitro assays, 3D gastric gland organoid cultures, mouse models, and human tissue samples to investigate the biological and molecular impact of DARPP-32 on activation of IGF1R and STAT3 signaling and gastric tumorigenesis. DARPP-32 enhanced phosphorylation of IGF1R (Y1135), a step that was critical for STAT3 phosphorylation at Y705, nuclear localization, and transcription activation. By using proximity ligation and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that IGF1R and DARPP-32 co-existed in the same protein complex. Binding of DARPP-32 to IGF1R promoted IGF1R phosphorylation with subsequent activation of downstream SRC and STAT3. Analysis of gastric tissues from the TFF1 knockout (KO) mouse model of gastric neoplasia, demonstrated phosphorylation of STAT3 in the early stages of gastric tumorigenesis. By crossing the TFF1 KO mice with DARPP-32 (DP) knockout (KO) mice, that have normal stomach, we obtained double knockout (TFF1 KO/DP KO). The gastric mucosa from the double KO mice did not show phosphorylation of IGF1R or STAT3. In addition, the TFF1 KO/DP KO mice had a significant delay in developing neoplastic gastric lesions. Analysis of human gastric cancer tissue microarrays, showed high levels of DARPP-32 and positive immunostaining for nuclear STAT3 in cancer tissues, as compared to non-cancer histologically normal tissues. In summary, the DARPP-32-IGF1R signaling axis plays a key role in regulating the STAT3 signaling, a critical step in gastric tumorigenesis.	
29670173        	Overexpression of HER2 in the pancreas promotes development of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms in mice.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 5% and is the sixth leading cause of cancer death. Although KRAS mutations are one of the major driver mutations in PDA, KRAS mutation alone is not sufficient to induce invasive pancreatic cancer in mice model. HER2, also known as ERBB2, is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and overexpression of HER2 is associated with poor clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer. However, no report has shown whether HER2 and its downstream signaling contributes to the pancreatic cancer development. By immunohistochemical analysis in human cases, HER2 protein expression was detected in 40% of PDAs and 29% of intraductal papillary mucinous carcinomas, another type of pancreatic cancer. In a mouse model, we showed overexpression of activated HER2 (HER2 NT ) in the pancreas, in which cystic neoplastic lesions resembling intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm-like lesions in humans had developed. We also found that HER2 NT cooperated with oncogenic Kras to accelerate the development of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms. In addition, using pancreatic organoids in 3D cultures, we found that organoids cultured from HER2 NT /Kras double transgenic mice showed proliferative potential and tumorigenic ability cooperatively. HER2-signaling inhibition was suggested to be an new therapeutic target in some types of PDAs.	
29756386        	KRAS mutation and epithelial-macrophage interplay in pancreatic neoplastic transformation.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by epithelial mutations in KRAS and prominent tumor-associated inflammation, including macrophage infiltration. But knowledge of early interactions between neoplastic epithelium and macrophages in PDA carcinogenesis is limited. Using a pancreatic organoid model, we found that the expression of mutant KRAS in organoids increased (i) ductal to acinar gene expression ratios, (ii) epithelial cells proliferation and (iii) colony formation capacity in vitro, and endowed pancreatic cells with the ability to generate neoplastic tumors in vivo. KRAS mutations induced a protumorigenic phenotype in macrophages. Altered macrophages decreased epithelial pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF) expression and induced a cancerous phenotype. We validated our findings using annotated patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and in our human PDA specimens. Epithelium-macrophage cross-talk occurs early in pancreatic carcinogenesis where KRAS directly induces cancer-related phenotypes in epithelium, and also promotes a protumorigenic phenotype in macrophages, in turn augmenting neoplastic growth.                © 2018 UICC.

31747605        	CREB5 Promotes Resistance to Androgen-Receptor Antagonists and Androgen Deprivation in Prostate Cancer.            	Androgen-receptor (AR) inhibitors, including enzalutamide, are used for treatment of all metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPCs). However, some patients develop resistance or never respond. We find that the transcription factor CREB5 confers enzalutamide resistance in an open reading frame (ORF) expression screen and in tumor xenografts. CREB5 overexpression is essential for an enzalutamide-resistant patient-derived organoid. In AR-expressing prostate cancer cells, CREB5 interactions enhance AR activity at a subset of promoters and enhancers upon enzalutamide treatment, including MYC and genes involved in the cell cycle. In mCRPC, we found recurrent amplification and overexpression of CREB5. Our observations identify CREB5 as one mechanism that drives resistance to AR antagonists in prostate cancers.

29438366        	IKKα is required in the intestinal epithelial cells for tumour stemness.            	Colorectal cancer is a common cause of death in developed countries. Progression from adenoma to invasive carcinoma requires accumulation of mutations starting with the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (Apc) gene. NF-κB signalling is a key element in cancer, mainly related to the activity of IKKβ. IKKα kinase also participates in this process by mechanisms that are primarily unknown.                We generated a compound mouse model with mutation in Apc and lacking intestinal epithelial IKKα, produced intestinal organoids and tumour spheroids with different genetic backgrounds, and performed immunohistochemistry and RNA-seq analysis.                Deficiency of IKKα prevents adenoma formation, with adenomas lacking IKKα showing reduced proliferation. In contrast, IKKα status did not affect normal intestinal function. The same divergent phenotype was found in the organoid-spheroid model. We also found that epithelial IKKα controls stemness, proliferation and apoptosis-related expression.                IKKα is a potential therapeutic target for Apc mutant colorectal cancer patients.	
29980571        	Erbin Suppresses KSR1-Mediated RAS/RAF Signaling and Tumorigenesis in Colorectal Cancer.            	Erbin belongs to the LAP (leucine-rich repeat and PDZ domain) family of scaffolding proteins that plays important roles in orchestrating cell signaling. Here, we show that Erbin functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer. Analysis of Erbin expression in colorectal cancer patient specimens revealed that Erbin was downregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in tumor tissues. Knockdown of Erbin disrupted epithelial cell polarity and increased cell proliferation in 3D culture. In addition, silencing Erbin resulted in increased amplitude and duration of signaling through Akt and RAS/RAF pathways. Erbin loss induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which coincided with a significant increase in cell migration and invasion. Erbin interacted with kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) and displaced it from the RAF/MEK/ERK complex to prevent signal propagation. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Erbin in Apc knockout mice promoted tumorigenesis and significantly reduced survival. Tumor organoids derived from Erbin/Apc double knockout mice displayed increased tumor initiation potential and activation of Wnt signaling. Results from gene set enrichment analysis revealed that Erbin expression associated positively with the E-cadherin adherens junction pathway and negatively with Wnt signaling in human colorectal cancer. Taken together, our study identifies Erbin as a negative regulator of tumor initiation and progression by suppressing Akt and RAS/RAF signaling in vivoSignificance: These findings establish the scaffold protein Erbin as a negative regulator of EMT and tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer through direct suppression of Akt and RAS/RAF signaling.

32650388        	Harnessing Omics Approaches on Advanced Preclinical Models to Discovery Novel Therapeutic Targets for the Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.            	Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains challenging because of the emergence of resistance mechanisms to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapeutics, so more effective strategies to improve the patients' outcome are needed. During the last decade, the application of a multi-omics approach has contributed to a deeper understanding of the complex molecular landscape of human CRC, identifying a plethora of drug targets for precision medicine. Target validation relies on the use of experimental models that would retain the molecular and clinical features of human colorectal cancer, thus mirroring the clinical characteristics of patients. In particular, organoids and patient-derived-xenografts (PDXs), as well as genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs), should be considered for translational purposes. Overall, omics and advanced mouse models of cancer represent a portfolio of sophisticated biological tools that, if optimized for use in concert with accurate data analysis, could accelerate the anticancer discovery process and provide new weapons against cancer. In this review, we highlight success reached following the integration of omics and experimental models; moreover, results produced by our group in the field of mCRC are also presented.	
33478104        	A Novel In Vitro Culture Model System to Study Merkel Cell Polyomavirus-Associated MCC Using Three-Dimensional Organotypic Raft Equivalents of Human Skin.            	Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a human polyomavirus causally linked to the development of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), an aggressive malignancy that largely arises within the dermis of the skin. In this study, we recapitulate the histopathology of human MCC tumors in vitro using an organotypic (raft) culture system that is traditionally used to recapitulate the dermal and epidermal equivalents of skin in three dimensions (3D). In the optimal culture condition, MCPyV+ MCC cells were embedded in collagen between the epidermal equivalent comprising human keratinocytes and a dermal equivalent containing fibroblasts, resulting in MCC-like lesions arising within the dermal equivalent. The presence and organization of MCC cells within these dermal lesions were characterized through biomarker analyses. Interestingly, co-culture of MCPyV+ MCC together with keratinocytes specifically within the epidermal equivalent of the raft did not reproduce human MCC morphology, nor were any keratinocytes necessary for MCC-like lesions to develop in the dermal equivalent. This 3D tissue culture system provides a novel in vitro platform for studying the role of MCPyV T antigens in MCC oncogenesis, identifying additional factors involved in this process, and for screening potential MCPyV+ MCC therapeutic strategies.	
25245692        	3D culture assays of murine mammary branching morphogenesis and epithelial invasion.            	Epithelia are fundamental tissues that line cavities, glands, and outer body surfaces. We use three-dimensional (3D) embedded culture of primary murine mammary epithelial ducts, called "organoids," to recapitulate in days in culture epithelial programs that occur over weeks deep within the body. Modulating the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) allows us to model cell- and tissue-level behaviors observed in normal development, such as branching morphogenesis, and in cancer, such as invasion and dissemination. Here, we describe a collection of protocols for 3D culture of mammary organoids in different ECMs and for immunofluorescence staining of 3D culture samples and mammary gland tissue sections. We illustrate expected phenotypic outcomes of each assay and provide troubleshooting tips for commonly encountered technical problems.	
30879894        	Chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.            	Chemotherapy is an important part of multimodality pancreatic cancer treatment. After curative resection, adjuvant chemotherapy can significantly improve disease free survival and overall survival. The current standard of care is six months adjuvant chemotherapy with modified folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) in patients fit enough for this protocol, otherwise six months of gemcitabine and capecitabine based on the European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC)-4 study. In patients with metastatic disease, combination chemotherapy according to the FOLFIRINOX protocol or with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel is an important improvement to gemcitabine monotherapy that was the standard for many years. Patients not fit for combination chemotherapy however may still benefit from gemcitabine. Patients with good performance status may benefit from second-line chemotherapy. Chemoradiation has long been used in locally advanced pancreatic cancer but is now tempered following the LAP07 study. This trial showed no difference in overall survival in those patients with stable disease after four months of gemcitabine (with or without erlotinib) randomized to either continuation of gemcitabine therapy or chemoradiation (54Gy with capecitabine). As an alternative to radiation, other forms local therapies including radiofrequency ablation, irreversible electroporation, high-intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation and local anti-KRAS therapy (using siG12D-LODER) are currently under investigation. Given the systemic nature of pancreas cancer from an early stage, the success of any local approach other than complete surgical resection (with adjuvant systemic therapy) is likely to be very limited. In patients with locally advanced, irresectable cancer, chemotherapy may offer the chance for secondary resection with a survival similar to patients with primary resectable disease. Downstaging regimens need to be evaluated in prospective randomized trials in order to make firm recommendations. Selection of patient groups for specific therapy including cytotoxics is becoming a reality using assays based on drug cellular transport and metabolism, and molecular signatures. Going forward, high throughput screening of different chemotherapy agents using molecular signatures based on patients' derived organoids holds considerable promise.

32679108        	Tumor Microenvironment-Derived NRG1 Promotes Antiandrogen Resistance in Prostate Cancer.            	Despite the development of second-generation antiandrogens, acquired resistance to hormone therapy remains a major challenge in treating advanced prostate cancer. We find that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote antiandrogen resistance in mouse models and in prostate organoid cultures. We identify neuregulin 1 (NRG1) in CAF supernatant, which promotes resistance in tumor cells through activation of HER3. Pharmacological blockade of the NRG1/HER3 axis using clinical-grade blocking antibodies re-sensitizes tumors to hormone deprivation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with increased tumor NRG1 activity have an inferior response to second-generation antiandrogen therapy. This work reveals a paracrine mechanism of antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer amenable to clinical testing using available targeted therapies.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

33379189        	3D Culture Systems for Exploring Cancer Immunology.            	Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, spurring extensive investigation into cancer immunology and how to exploit this biology for therapeutic benefit. Current methods to investigate cancer-immune cell interactions and develop novel drug therapies rely on either two-dimensional (2D) culture systems or murine models. However, three-dimensional (3D) culture systems provide a potentially superior alternative model to both 2D and murine approaches. As opposed to 2D models, 3D models are more physiologically relevant and better replicate tumor complexities. Compared to murine models, 3D models are cheaper, faster, and can study the human immune system. In this review, we discuss the most common 3D culture systems-spheroids, organoids, and microfluidic chips-and detail how these systems have advanced our understanding of cancer immunology.	
32430479        	The Interleukin 22 Pathway Interacts with Mutant KRAS to Promote Poor Prognosis in Colon Cancer.            	The cytokine IL22 promotes tumor progression in murine models of colorectal cancer. However, the clinical significance of IL22 in human colorectal cancer remains unclear. We sought to determine whether the IL22 pathway is associated with prognosis in human colorectal cancer, and to identify mechanisms by which IL22 can influence disease progression.                Transcriptomic data from stage II/III colon cancers in independent discovery (GSE39582 population-based cohort, N = 566) and verification (PETACC3 clinical trial, N = 752) datasets were used to investigate the association between IL22 receptor expression (encoded by the genes IL22RA1 and IL10RB), tumor mutation status, and clinical outcome using Cox proportional hazard models. Functional interactions between IL22 and mutant KRAS were elucidated using human colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumor organoids.                Transcriptomic analysis revealed a poor-prognosis subset of tumors characterized by high expression of IL22RA1, the alpha subunit of the heterodimeric IL22 receptor, and KRAS mutation [relapse-free survival (RFS): HR = 2.93, P = 0.0006; overall survival (OS): HR = 2.45, P = 0.0023]. KRAS mutations showed a similar interaction with IL10RB and conferred the worst prognosis in tumors with high expression of both IL22RA1 and IL10RB (RFS: HR = 3.81, P = 0.0036; OS: HR = 3.90, P = 0.0050). Analysis of human colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumor organoids, including an isogenic cell line pair that differed only in KRAS mutation status, showed that IL22 and mutant KRAS cooperatively enhance cancer cell proliferation, in part through augmentation of the Myc pathway.                Interactions between KRAS and IL22 signaling may underlie a previously unrecognized subset of clinically aggressive colorectal cancer that could benefit from therapeutic modulation of the IL22 pathway.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
25453261        	Modeling human carcinomas: physiologically relevant 3D models to improve anti-cancer drug development.            	Anti-cancer drug development is inefficient, mostly due to lack of efficacy in human patients. The high fail rate is partly due to the lack of predictive models or the inadequate use of existing preclinical test systems. However, progress has been made and preclinical models were improved or newly developed, which all account for basic features of solid cancers, three-dimensionality and heterotypic cell interaction. Here we give an overview of available in vivo and in vitro models of cancer, which meet the criteria of being 3D and mirroring human tumor-stroma interactions. We only focus on drug response models without touching models for pharmacokinetic and dynamic, toxicity or delivery aspects.                 Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
32703770        	Intraductal Transplantation Models of Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Reveal Progressive Transition of Molecular Subtypes.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal common malignancy, with little improvement in patient outcomes over the past decades. Recently, subtypes of pancreatic cancer with different prognoses have been elaborated; however, the inability to model these subtypes has precluded mechanistic investigation of their origins. Here, we present a xenotransplantation model of PDAC in which neoplasms originate from patient-derived organoids injected directly into murine pancreatic ducts. Our model enables distinction of the two main PDAC subtypes: intraepithelial neoplasms from this model progress in an indolent or invasive manner representing the classical or basal-like subtypes of PDAC, respectively. Parameters that influence PDAC subtype specification in this intraductal model include cell plasticity and hyperactivation of the RAS pathway. Finally, through intratumoral dissection and the direct manipulation of RAS gene dosage, we identify a suite of RAS-regulated secreted and membrane-bound proteins that may represent potential candidates for therapeutic intervention in patients with PDAC. SIGNIFICANCE: Accurate modeling of the molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer is crucial to facilitate the generation of effective therapies. We report the development of an intraductal organoid transplantation model of pancreatic cancer that models the progressive switching of subtypes, and identify stochastic and RAS-driven mechanisms that determine subtype specification.See related commentary by Pickering and Morton, p. 1448.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1426.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
23220351        	Short term effects of gamma radiation on endothelial barrier function: uncoupling of PECAM-1.            	A limiting factor in the treatment of cancer with radiotherapy is the damage to surrounding normal tissue, particularly the vasculature. Vessel pathologies are a major feature of the side effects of radiotherapy and little is known about early events that could initiate subsequent diseases. We tested the hypothesis that gamma radiation has early damaging effects on the human endothelial barrier. Two models were used; Human Brain Microcapillary Endothelial Cells (HBMEC), and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). Endpoints included Trans-Endothelial Electrical Resistance (TEER), barrier permeability to 10 kDa and 70 kDa tracer molecules, and the localization of F-actin, and junction proteins and the Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (PECAM-1). Radiation induced a rapid and transient decrease in TEER at 3 h, with effects also seen at the radiotherapy doses. This dip in resistance correlated to the transient loss of PECAM-1 in discrete areas where cells often detached from the monolayer leaving gaps. Redistribution of PECAM-1 was also seen in 3-D human tissue models. By 6 h, the remaining cells had migrated to reseal the barrier, coincident with TEER returning to control levels. Resealed monolayers contained fewer cells per unit area and their barrier function was weakened as evidenced by an increased permeability over 24 h. This is the first demonstration of a transient and rapid effect of gamma radiation on human endothelial barriers that involves cell detachment and the loss of PECAM-1. Considering the association of cell adhesion molecules with vasculopathies, such an effect has the potential to be clinically relevant to the longer-term effects of radiotherapy.

24268309        	Secondary neoplasms associated with nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn: a study of 707 cases.            	Nevus sebaceus is commonly associated with the development of secondary neoplasms. Data on the frequency of malignant tumors vary considerably in published reports.                We sought to analyze the distribution of secondary neoplasm in nevus sebaceus.                A retrospective analysis of all cases of nevus sebaceus diagnosed at the Ackerman Academy of Dermatopathology from 1999 to 2012 was conducted.                A total of 706 patients (707 specimens) were included in the study. Trichoblastoma was the most frequent benign tumor (n = 52, 7.4%) followed by syringocystadenoma papilliferum (n = 33, 5.2%). Malignant tumors were present in 2.5% of the specimens with basal cell carcinoma being the most common (n = 8, 1.1%) followed by squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4, 0.57%). The incidence of secondary neoplasms was statistically related to age and anatomic site (P < .05). Almost all malignant tumors were seen in adults.                Some of our cases were referred for second opinion and there may be a bias in our data toward unusual secondary neoplasms.                Our study confirms that most of the secondary neoplasms arising in association with nevus sebaceus are benign.

30071882        	Exploring the OncoGenomic Landscape of cancer.            	The widespread incorporation of next-generation sequencing into clinical oncology has yielded an unprecedented amount of molecular data from thousands of patients. A main current challenge is to find out reliable ways to extrapolate results from one group of patients to another and to bring rationale to individual cases in the light of what is known from the cohorts.                We present OncoGenomic Landscapes, a framework to analyze and display thousands of cancer genomic profiles in a 2D space. Our tool allows users to rapidly assess the heterogeneity of large cohorts, enabling the comparison to other groups of patients, and using driver genes as landmarks to aid in the interpretation of the landscapes. In our web-server, we also offer the possibility of mapping new samples and cohorts onto 22 predefined landscapes related to cancer cell line panels, organoids, patient-derived xenografts, and clinical tumor samples.                Contextualizing individual subjects in a more general landscape of human cancer is a valuable aid for basic researchers and clinical oncologists trying to identify treatment opportunities, maybe yet unapproved, for patients that ran out of standard therapeutic options.

30005951        	The Circadian Clock Regulates Metabolic Phenotype Rewiring Via HKDC1 and Modulates Tumor Progression and Drug Response in Colorectal Cancer.            	An endogenous molecular clockwork drives various cellular pathways including metabolism and the cell cycle. Its dysregulation is able to prompt pathological phenotypes including cancer. Besides dramatic metabolic alterations, cancer cells display severe changes in the clock phenotype with likely consequences in tumor progression and treatment response. In this study, we use a comprehensive systems-driven approach to investigate the effect of clock disruption on metabolic pathways and its impact on drug response in a cellular model of colon cancer progression. We identified distinctive time-related transcriptomic and metabolic features of a primary tumor and its metastatic counterpart. A mapping of the expression data to a comprehensive genome-scale reconstruction of human metabolism allowed for the in-depth functional characterization of 24 h-oscillating transcripts and pointed to a clock-driven metabolic reprogramming in tumorigenesis. In particular, we identified a set of five clock-regulated glycolysis genes, ALDH3A2, ALDOC, HKDC1, PCK2, and PDHB with differential temporal expression patterns. These findings were validated in organoids and in primary fibroblasts isolated from normal colon and colon adenocarcinoma from the same patient. We further identified a reciprocal connection of HKDC1 to the clock in the primary tumor, which is lost in the metastatic cells. Interestingly, a disruption of the core-clock gene BMAL1 impacts on HKDC1 and leads to a time-dependent rewiring of metabolism, namely an increase in glycolytic activity, as well as changes in treatment response. This work provides novel evidence regarding the complex interplay between the circadian clock and metabolic alterations in carcinogenesis and identifies new connections between both systems with pivotal roles in cancer progression and response to therapy.

33015525        	Dickkopf-1 Can Lead to Immune Evasion in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.            	Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with low androgen receptor (AR) and without neuroendocrine signaling, termed double-negative prostate cancer (DNPC), is increasingly prevalent in patients treated with AR signaling inhibitors and is in need of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.                Candidate genes enriched in DNPC were determined using differential gene expression analysis of discovery and validation cohorts of mCRPC biopsies. Laboratory studies were carried out in human mCRPC organoid cultures, prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and mouse xenograft models. Epigenetic studies were carried out in a rapid autopsy cohort.                Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression is increased in DNPC relative to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 v 0.28 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; q < 0.05; n = 117) and in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 v 0.99 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; P < .0001). DKK1 expression can be regulated by activated Wnt signaling in vitro and correlates with activating canonical Wnt signaling mutations and low PSA mRNA in mCRPC biopsies (P < .05). DKK1 hypomethylation was associated with increased DKK1 mRNA expression (Pearson r = -0.66; P < .0001) in a rapid autopsy cohort (n = 7). DKK1-high mCRPC biopsies are infiltrated with significantly higher numbers of quiescent natural killer (NK) cells (P < .005) and lower numbers of activated NK cells (P < .0005). Growth inhibition of the human PCa model PC3 by the anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody DKN-01 depends on the presence of NK cells in a severe combined immunodeficient xenograft mouse model.                These results support DKK1 as a contributor to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of DNPC. These data have provided the rationale for a clinical trial targeting DKK1 in mCRPC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03837353).                © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

31614722        	A Cancer Spheroid Array Chip for Selecting Effective Drug.            	A cancer spheroid array chip was developed by modifying a micropillar and microwell structure to improve the evaluation of drugs targeting specific mutations such as phosphor-epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR). The chip encapsulated cells in alginate and allowed cancer cells to grow for over seven days to form cancer spheroids. However, reagents or media used to screen drugs in a high-density spheroid array had to be replaced very carefully, and this was a tedious task. Particularly, the immunostaining of cancer spheroids required numerous steps to replace many of the reagents used for drug evaluation. To solve this problem, we adapted a micropillar and microwell structure to a spheroid array. Thus, culturing cancer spheroids in alginate spots attached to the micropillar allowed us to replace the reagents in the microwell chip with a single fill of fresh medium, without damaging the cancer spheroids. In this study, a cancer spheroid array was made from a p-EGFR-overexpressing cell line (A549 lung cancer cell line). In a 12 by 36 column array chip (25 mm by 75 mm), the spheroid over 100 µm in diameter started to form at day seven and p-EGFR was also considerably overexpressed. The array was used for p-EGFR inhibition and cell viability measurement against seventy drugs, including ten EGFR-targeting drugs. By comparing drug response in the spheroid array (spheroid model) with that in the single-cell model, we demonstrated that the two models showed different responses and that the spheroid model might be more resistant to some drugs, thus narrowing the choice of drug candidates.	
32367629        	In vitro three-dimensional culture systems of salivary glands.            	Dry mouth can be caused by salivary gland hypofunction due to Sjögren's syndrome (SS) or radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, and it can also be a side effect of medications. The use of sialagogues effectively increases saliva secretion in patients with dry mouth. However, the application of sialagogues is not always satisfactory because of their side effects, such as sweating, nausea, runny nose and diarrhea. Two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures have been used not only for drug screening and discovery but also to clarify disease mechanisms. However, three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures are expected to be even more advantageous than 2D cell cultures. Therefore, we have tried to develop an in vitro cell culture system that can reconstitute 3D salivary glands. Sox9 and Foxc1 were identified as important genes that differentiate mouse embryonic stem cell-derived oral ectoderm into salivary gland placode. Using these genes and organoid culture systems, we succeeded in generating salivary gland organoids that exhibited a morphology and gene expression profile that were similar to those of the embryonic rudiment from which salivary glands arise in normal mice. These organoids are expected to be a promising tool for disease modeling, drug discovery and regenerative medicine in salivary glands.                © 2020 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.	
29069492        	Lectin ZG16p inhibits proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells via its carbohydrate-binding sites.            	Zymogen granule protein 16 (ZG16p) is a soluble lectin that binds to both mannose and heparin/heparan sulfate. It is highly expressed in the human digestive tract and is secreted into the mucus. In this study, we investigated the effect of ZG16p on the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells. Overexpression of ZG16p in Caco-2 cells decreased cell growth. Recombinant ZG16p markedly inhibited proliferation of Caco-2, LS174T, HCT116 and HCT15 cells. Caco-2 cell growth was not inhibited by two mutated ZG16p proteins, D151A and M5 (K36A, R37A, R53A, R55A and R79A) lacking mannose- and heparin-binding activities, respectively. Immunofluorescent cell staining revealed that ZG16p-D151A maintained its binding to the Caco-2 cell surface, whereas ZG16p-M5 failed to bind to the cells. These results suggest that ZG16p interacts with the cell surface via basic amino acids substituted in ZG16p-M5 and inhibits Caco-2 cell proliferation via Asp151. In addition, growth of patient-derived colorectal tumor organoids in a 3D intestinal stem cell system was suppressed by ZG16p but not by ZG16p-M5. Taken together, our findings indicate that ZG16p inhibits the growth of colorectal cancer cells via its carbohydrate-binding sites in vitro and ex vivo. In this study, a novel pathway in cancer cell growth regulation through cell surface carbohydrate chains is suggested.                © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

32941878        	Expression of R-Spondin 1 in ApcMin/+ Mice Suppresses Growth of Intestinal Adenomas by Altering Wnt and Transforming Growth Factor Beta Signaling.            	Mutations in the APC gene and other genes in the Wnt signaling pathway contribute to development of colorectal carcinomas. R-spondins (RSPOs) are secreted proteins that amplify Wnt signaling in intestinal stem cells. Alterations in RSPO genes have been identified in human colorectal tumors. We studied the effects of RSPO1 overexpression in ApcMin/+ mutant mice.                An adeno associated viral vector encoding RSPO1-Fc fusion protein, or control vector, was injected into ApcMin/+mice. Their intestinal crypts were isolated and cultured as organoids. which were incubated with or without RSPO1-Fc and an inhibitor of transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFBR). Livers were collected from mice and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Organoids and adenomas were analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, single cell RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry.                Intestines from Apc+/+ mice injected with the vector encoding RSPO1-Fc had significantly deeper crypts, longer villi, with increased EdU labeling, indicating increased proliferation of epithelial cells, in comparison to mice given control vector. AAV-RSPO1-Fc-transduced ApcMin/+ mice also developed fewer and smaller intestinal tumors and had significantly longer survival times. Adenomas of ApcMin/+ mice injected with the RSPO1-Fc vector showed a rapid increase in apoptosis and in the expression of Wnt target genes, followed by reduced expression of messenger RNAs and proteins regulated by the Wnt pathway, reduced cell proliferation, and less crypt branching than adenomas of mice given the control vector. Addition of RSPO1 reduced the number of adenoma organoids derived from ApcMin/+ mice and suppressed expression of Wnt target genes but increased phosphorylation of SMAD2 and transcription of genes regulated by SMAD. Inhibition of TGFBR signaling in organoids stimulated with RSPO1-Fc restored organoid formation and expression of genes regulated by Wnt. The TGFBR inhibitor restored apoptosis in adenomas from ApcMin/+ mice expressing RSPO1-Fc back to the same level as in the adenomas from mice given the control vector.                Expression of RSPO1 in ApcMin/+ mice increases apoptosis and reduces proliferation and Wnt signaling in adenoma cells, resulting in development of fewer and smaller intestinal tumors and longer mouse survival. Addition of RSPO1 to organoids derived from adenomas inhibits their growth and promotes proliferation of intestinal stem cells that retain the APC protein; these effects are reversed by TGFB inhibitor. Strategies to increase the expression of RSPO1 might be developed for the treatment of intestinal adenomas.                Copyright © 2021 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

31411736        	Molecular characterization of colorectal adenomas reveals POFUT1 as a candidate driver of tumor progression.            	Removal of colorectal adenomas is an effective strategy to reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rates. However, as only a minority of adenomas progress to cancer, such strategies may lead to overtreatment. The present study aimed to characterize adenomas by in-depth molecular profiling, to obtain insights into altered biology associated with the colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma progression. We obtained low-coverage whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry data for 30 CRCs, 30 adenomas and 18 normal adjacent colon samples. These data were used for DNA copy number aberrations profiling, differential expression, gene set enrichment and gene-dosage effect analysis. Protein expression was independently validated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays and in patient-derived colorectal adenoma organoids. Stroma percentage was determined by digital image analysis of tissue sections. Twenty-four out of 30 adenomas could be unambiguously classified as high risk (n = 9) or low risk (n = 15) of progressing to cancer, based on DNA copy number profiles. Biological processes more prevalent in high-risk than low-risk adenomas were related to proliferation, tumor microenvironment and Notch, Wnt, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Hedgehog signaling, while metabolic processes and protein secretion were enriched in low-risk adenomas. DNA copy number driven gene-dosage effect in high-risk adenomas and cancers was observed for POFUT1, RPRD1B and EIF6. Increased POFUT1 expression in high-risk adenomas was validated in tissue samples and organoids. High POFUT1 expression was also associated with Notch signaling enrichment and with decreased goblet cells differentiation. In-depth molecular characterization of colorectal adenomas revealed POFUT1 and Notch signaling as potential drivers of tumor progression.                © 2019 The Authors.

30290244        	Potent in vivo lung cancer Wnt signaling inhibition via cyclodextrin-LGK974 inclusion complexes.            	Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway promotes lung cancer progression and contributes to poor patient prognosis. The porcupine inhibitor LGK974, a novel orally bioavailable cancer therapeutic in Phase I clinical trials, induces potent Wnt signaling inhibition and leads to suppressed growth and progression of multiple types of cancers. The clinical use of LGK974, however, is limited in part due to its low solubility and high toxicity in tissues that rely on Wnt signaling for normal homeostasis. Here, we report the use of host-guest chemistry to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of LGK974 in mice through complexation with cyclodextrins (CD). We assessed the effects of these complexes to inhibit Wnt signaling in lung adenocarcinomas that are typically driven by overactive Wnt signaling. 2D 1H NMR confirmed host-guest complexation of CDs with LGK974. CD:LGK974 complexes significantly decreased the expression of Wnt target genes in lung cancer organoids and in lung cancer allografts in mice. Further, CD:LGK974 complexes increased the bioavailability upon oral administration in mice compared to free LGK974. In a mouse lung cancer allograft model, CD:LGK974 complexes induced potent Wnt signaling inhibition with reduced intestinal toxicity compared to treatment with free drug. Collectively, the development of these complexes enables safer and repeated oral or parenteral administration of Wnt signaling inhibitors, which hold promise for the treatment of multiple types of malignancies.

32242269        	[Report from the 9th symposium of the German Association for Bladder Cancer Research].            	The annual symposium of the German Research Association for Bladder Carcinoma (DFBK) was organized on February 7th and 8th, 2020, in Düsseldorf. On the first day, eight international guest speakers invited by the DFBK and the Department of Urology of the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf presented the current state of research on bladder cancer (BC). Topics were genomic changes and molecular classification in non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive BC, prospects and limits of proteome technology in urine diagnostics, function of chromatin regulators in bladder carcinogenesis, cellular reactions to aneuploidy, organoid technology and biobanking, as well as novel aspects of immunotherapy for BC. The second day was dedicated to new results and ideas of the DFBK members on BC pathomechanisms, diagnostics and therapeutic approaches, and most importantly, discussions on the further development of collaborative projects.

32192303        	[Guiding significance of pathological diagnosis in watch and wait strategy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant therapy].            	Some studies have demonstrated promising results of watch and wait (W&W) approaches in carefully selected patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who get a clinical complete response (cCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). This approach of organ- preservation helps patients avoid surgery and its related morbidity and mortality. nCRT will lead to the regression of the tumor cells and the uneven distribution of the residual tumor cells. The reliability of biopsy is still unsatisfactory in W&W strategy due to the high ratio of false negative cases. Therefore, the patients with negative histopathological assessment should also receive a strict follow-up. In the future, immune microenvironment and molecular markers, patient derived organoid, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfDNA) may be helpful for screening and monitoring patients undergoing W&W.	
31772152        	NF-κB2 signalling in enteroids modulates enterocyte responses to secreted factors from bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.            	Alternative pathway NF-κB signalling regulates susceptibility towards developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colitis-associated cancer and sepsis-associated intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis and shedding. However, the cell populations responsible for the perturbed alternative pathway NF-κB signalling in intestinal mucosal pathology remain unclear. In order to investigate the contribution of the epithelial compartment, we have tested whether NF-κB2 regulated transcription in intestinal epithelial cells controls the intestinal epithelial response to cytokines that are known to disrupt intestinal barrier permeability. Enteroids were generated from the proximal, middle and distal regions of small intestine (SI) from C57BL/6J wild-type mice and displayed region-specific morphology that was maintained during sub-culture. Enteroids treated with 100 ng/mL TNF were compared with corresponding regions of SI from C57BL/6J mice treated systemically with 0.33 mg/kg TNF for 1.5 h. TNF-induced apoptosis in all regions of the intestine in vitro and in vivo but resulted in Paneth cell degranulation only in proximal tissue-derived SI and enteroids. TNF also resulted in increased enteroid sphericity (quantified as circularity from two-dimensional bright field images). This response was dose and time-dependent and correlated with active caspase-3 immunopositivity. Proximal tissue-derived enteroids generated from Nfκb2-/- mice showed a significantly blunted circularity response following the addition of TNF, IFNγ, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated C57BL/6J-derived bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and secreted factors from LPS-activated BMDCs. However, Nfκb1-/- mouse-derived enteroids showed no significant changes in response to these stimuli. In conclusion, the selection of SI region is important when designing enteroid studies as region-specific identity and response to stimuli such as TNF are maintained in culture. Intestinal epithelial cells are at least partially responsible for regulating their own fate by modulating NF-κB2 signalling in response to stimuli known to be involved in multiple intestinal and systemic diseases. Future studies are warranted to investigate the therapeutic potential of intestinal epithelial NF-κB2 inhibition.	
28386018        	PanIN Neuroendocrine Cells Promote Tumorigenesis via Neuronal Cross-talk.            	Nerves are a notable feature of the tumor microenvironment in some epithelial tumors, but their role in the malignant progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is uncertain. Here, we identify dense innervation in the microenvironment of precancerous pancreatic lesions, known as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanIN), and describe a unique subpopulation of neuroendocrine PanIN cells that express the neuropeptide substance P (SP) receptor neurokinin 1-R (NK1-R). Using organoid culture, we demonstrated that sensory neurons promoted the proliferation of PanIN organoids via SP-NK1-R signaling and STAT3 activation. Nerve-responsive neuroendocrine cells exerted trophic influences and potentiated global PanIN organoid growth. Sensory denervation of a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC led to loss of STAT3 activation, a decrease in the neoplastic neuroendocrine cell population, and impaired PanIN progression to tumor. Overall, our data provide evidence that nerves of the PanIN microenvironment promote oncogenesis, likely via direct signaling to neoplastic neuroendocrine cells capable of trophic influences. These findings identify neuroepithelial cross-talk as a potential novel target in PDAC treatment.

27348469        	Paneth Cell-Rich Regions Separated by a Cluster of Lgr5+ Cells Initiate Crypt Fission in the Intestinal Stem Cell Niche.            	The crypts of the intestinal epithelium house the stem cells that ensure the continual renewal of the epithelial cells that line the intestinal tract. Crypt number increases by a process called crypt fission, the division of a single crypt into two daughter crypts. Fission drives normal tissue growth and maintenance. Correspondingly, it becomes less frequent in adulthood. Importantly, fission is reactivated to drive adenoma growth. The mechanisms governing fission are poorly understood. However, only by knowing how normal fission operates can cancer-associated changes be elucidated. We studied normal fission in tissue in three dimensions using high-resolution imaging and used intestinal organoids to identify underlying mechanisms. We discovered that both the number and relative position of Paneth cells and Lgr5+ cells are important for fission. Furthermore, the higher stiffness and increased adhesion of Paneth cells are involved in determining the site of fission. Formation of a cluster of Lgr5+ cells between at least two Paneth-cell-rich domains establishes the site for the upward invagination that initiates fission.	
30871626        	Cocultures of human colorectal tumor spheroids with immune cells reveal the therapeutic potential of MICA/B and NKG2A targeting for cancer treatment.            	Immunotherapies still fail to benefit colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Relevant functional assays aimed at studying these failures and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in human are scarce. 3D tumor cultures, called tumor organoids or spheroids, represent interesting models to study cancer treatments and could help to challenge these issues.                We analyzed heterotypic cocultures of human colon tumor-derived spheroids with immune cells to assess the infiltration, activation and function of T and NK cells toward human colorectal tumors in vitro.                We showed that allogeneic T and NK cells rapidly infiltrated cell line-derived spheroids, inducing immune-mediated tumor cell apoptosis and spheroid destruction. NKG2D, a key activator of cytotoxic responses, was engaged on infiltrating cells. We thus assessed the therapeutic potential of an antibody targeting the specific ligands of NKG2D, MICA and MICB, in this system. Anti-MICA/B enhanced immune-dependent destruction of tumor spheroid by driving an increased NK cells infiltration and activation. Interestingly, tumor cells reacted to immune infiltration by upregulating HLA-E, ligand of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A expressed by CD8 and NK cells. NKG2A was increased after anti-MICA/B treatment and, accordingly, combination of anti-MICA/B and anti-NKG2A was synergistic. These observations were ultimately confirmed in a clinical relevant model of coculture between CRC patients-derived spheroids and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.                Altogether, we show that tumor spheroids represent a relevant tool to study tumor-lymphocyte interactions on human tissues and revealed the antitumor potential of immunomodulatory antibodies targeting MICA/B and NKG2A.

33043003        	Gastric Stem Cells: Physiological and Pathological Perspectives.            	Gastric epithelium operates in a hazardous environment that curtails the lifespan of the constituent cells, imposing a requirement for continuous epithelial renewal. Stem cells that reside in the stomach are thus essential for regulating physiological tissue renewal and injury repair because of their self-renewal, high proliferation capacity and multiple differentiation potentials. Recent investigations using lineage tracing models have identified diverse populations of gastric stem cells and even fully differentiated cells that can regain stem cell capacity, so enriching our understanding on the identity and plasticity of gastric stem cells. These cell populations include the Villin promotor, Lgr5+, CCKR2+, Axin2+ and AQP5+ stem cells in the antrum, TFF2 mRNA, Mist1+ cells and Troy+ mature chief cells in the corpus, as well as Sox2, eR1, Lrig1, Bmi1-marked cell in both the antrum and the corpus. Establishment of gastric organoids derived from primary gastric tissues and pluripotent stem cells or embryonic stem cells characterizes niche factors required by the gastric stem cell populations, and further provides new insights into stomach development, host-Helicobacter pylori interactions and malignant transformation. Furthermore, focus on the gastric stem cells and their niches uncovers the initiation of stomach precancerous lesions and origin of gastric cancer, providing options for cancer prevention and intervention. In summary, with the development of stem cell research, gastric stem cells give us more opportunities to prevent and treat stomach diseases.                Copyright © 2020 Xiao and Zhou.	
30109253        	Epithelial Smad4 Deletion Up-Regulates Inflammation and Promotes Inflammation-Associated Cancer.            	Chronic inflammation is a predisposing condition for colorectal cancer. Many studies to date have focused on proinflammatory signaling pathways in the colon. Understanding the mechanisms that suppress inflammation, particularly in epithelial cells, is critical for developing therapeutic interventions. Here, we explored the roles of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family signaling through SMAD4 in colonic epithelial cells.                The Smad4 gene was deleted specifically in adult murine intestinal epithelium. Colitis was induced by 3 rounds of dextran sodium sulfate in drinking water, after which mice were observed for up to 3 months. Nontransformed mouse colonocyte cell lines and colonoid cultures and human colorectal cancer cell lines were analyzed for responses to TGFβ1 and bone morphogenetic protein 2.                Dextran sodium sulfate treatment was sufficient to drive carcinogenesis in mice lacking colonic Smad4 expression, with resulting tumors bearing striking resemblance to human colitis-associated carcinoma. Loss of SMAD4 protein was observed in 48% of human colitis-associated carcinoma samples as compared with 19% of sporadic colorectal carcinomas. Loss of Smad4 increased the expression of inflammatory mediators within nontransformed mouse colon epithelial cells in vivo. In vitro analysis of mouse and human colonic epithelial cell lines and organoids indicated that much of this regulation was cell autonomous. Furthermore, TGFβ signaling inhibited the epithelial inflammatory response to proinflammatory cytokines.                TGFβ suppresses the expression of proinflammatory genes in the colon epithelium, and loss of its downstream mediator, SMAD4, is sufficient to initiate inflammation-driven colon cancer.

33011162        	Apigenin by targeting hnRNPA2 sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer spheroids to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and regulates expression of ABCC4 and ABCG2 drug efflux transporters.            	Acquired resistance to doxorubicin is a major hurdle in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) therapy, emphasizing the need to identify improved strategies. Apigenin and other structurally related dietary flavones are emerging as potential chemo-sensitizers, but their effect on three-dimensional TNBC spheroid models has not been investigated. We previously showed that apigenin associates with heterogeneous ribonuclear protein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2), an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA and co-transcriptional regulation. However, the role of hnRNPA2 in apigenin chemo-sensitizing activity has not been investigated. Here, we show that apigenin induced apoptosis in TNBC spheroids more effectively than apigenin-glycoside, owing to higher cellular uptake. Moreover, apigenin inhibited the growth of TNBC patient-derived organoids at an in vivo achievable concentration. Apigenin sensitized spheroids to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, triggering caspase-9-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway and caspase-3 activity. Silencing of hnRNPA2 decreased apigenin-induced sensitization to doxorubicin in spheroids by diminishing apoptosis and partly abrogated apigenin-mediated reduction of ABCC4 and ABCG2 efflux transporters. Together these findings provide novel insights into the critical role of hnRNPA2 in mediating apigenin-induced sensitization of TNBC spheroids to doxorubicin by increasing the expression of efflux transporters and apoptosis, underscoring the relevance of using dietary compounds as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant.

33396714        	Exploring the Potential of Drug Response Assays for Precision Medicine in Ovarian Cancer.            	One of the major challenges in the treatment of cancer are differential responses of patients to existing standard of care anti-cancer drugs. These differential responses may, in part, be due to a diverse range of genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolic alterations among individuals suffering from the same type of cancer. Precision medicine is an emerging approach in cancer therapeutics that takes into account specific molecular alterations, environmental factors as well as lifestyle of individual patients. This approach allows clinicians and researchers to select or predict treatments that would most likely benefit the patient based on their individual tumor characteristics. One class of precision medicine tools are predictive, in vitro drug-response assays designed to test the sensitivity of patient tumor cells to existing or novel therapies. These assays have the potential to rapidly identify the most effective treatments for cancer patients and thus hold great promise in the field of precision medicine. In this review, we have highlighted several drug-response assays developed in ovarian cancer and discussed the current challenges and future prospects of these assays in the clinical management of this disease.	
28383660        	CHD1 loss sensitizes prostate cancer to DNA damaging therapy by promoting error-prone double-strand break repair.            	Deletion of the chromatin remodeler chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is a common genomic alteration found in human prostate cancers (PCas). CHD1 loss represents a distinct PCa subtype characterized by SPOP mutation and higher genomic instability. However, the role of CHD1 in PCa development in vivo and its clinical utility remain unclear.                To study the role of CHD1 in PCa development and its loss in clinical management, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model with prostate-specific deletion of murine Chd1 as well as isogenic CHD1 wild-type and homozygous deleted human benign and PCa lines. We also developed patient-derived organoid cultures and screened patients with metastatic PCa for CHD1 loss.                We demonstrate that CHD1 loss sensitizes cells to DNA damage and causes a synthetic lethal response to DNA damaging therapy in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo, in patient-derived organoid cultures and in a patient with metastatic PCa. Mechanistically, CHD1 regulates 53BP1 stability and CHD1 loss leads to decreased error-free homologous recombination (HR) repair, which is compensated by increased error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair.                Our study provides the first in vivo and in patient evidence supporting the role of CHD1 in DSB repair and in response to DNA damaging therapy. We uncover mechanistic insights that CHD1 modulates the choice between HR and NHEJ DSB repair and suggest that CHD1 loss may contribute to the genomic instability seen in this subset of PCas.                © The Author 2017.

33217448        	RNA N6-Methyladenosine Methyltransferase METTL3 Facilitates Colorectal Cancer by Activating the m6A-GLUT1-mTORC1 Axis and Is a Therapeutic Target.            	RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has recently emerged as a new regulatory mechanism in cancer progression. We aimed to explore the role of the m6A regulatory enzyme METTL3 in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.                The expression and clinical implication of METTL3 were investigated in multiple human CRC cohorts. The underlying mechanisms of METTL3 in CRC were investigated by integrative m6A sequencing, RNA sequencing, and ribosome profiling analyses. The efficacy of targeting METTL3 in CRC treatment was elucidated in CRC cell lines, patient-derived CRC organoids, and Mettl3-knockout mouse models.                Using targeted clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 dropout screening, we identified METTL3 as the top essential m6A regulatory enzyme in CRC. METTL3 was overexpressed in 62.2% (79/127) and 88.0% (44/50) of primary CRCs from 2 independent cohorts. High METTL3 expression predicted poor survival in patients with CRC (n = 374, P < .01). Functionally, silencing METTL3 suppressed tumorigenesis in CRC cells, human-derived primary CRC organoids, and Mettl3-knockout mouse models. We discovered the novel functional m6A methyltransferase domain of METTL3 in CRC cells by domain-focused CRISPR screening and mutagenesis assays. Mechanistically, METTL3 directly induced the m6A-GLUT1-mTORC1 axis as identified by integrated m6A sequencing, RNA sequencing, ribosome sequencing, and functional validation. METTL3 induced GLUT1 translation in an m6A-dependent manner, which subsequently promoted glucose uptake and lactate production, leading to the activation of mTORC1 signaling and CRC development. Furthermore, inhibition of mTORC1 potentiated the anticancer effect of METTL3 silencing in CRC patient-derived organoids and METTL3 transgenic mouse models.                METTL3 promotes CRC by activating the m6A-GLUT1-mTORC1 axis. METTL3 is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

32820248        	Animal and translational models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.            	COVID-19 is causing a major once-in-a-century global pandemic. The scientific and clinical community is in a race to define and develop effective preventions and treatments. The major features of disease are described but clinical trials have been hampered by competing interests, small scale, lack of defined patient cohorts and defined readouts. What is needed now is head-to-head comparison of existing drugs, testing of safety including in the background of predisposing chronic diseases, and the development of new and targeted preventions and treatments. This is most efficiently achieved using representative animal models of primary infection including in the background of chronic disease with validation of findings in primary human cells and tissues. We explore and discuss the diverse animal, cell and tissue models that are being used and developed and collectively recapitulate many critical aspects of disease manifestation in humans to develop and test new preventions and treatments.	
31582380        	MFF Regulation of Mitochondrial Cell Death Is a Therapeutic Target in Cancer.            	The regulators of mitochondrial cell death in cancer have remained elusive, hampering the development of new therapies. Here, we showed that protein isoforms of mitochondrial fission factor (MFF1 and MFF2), a molecule that controls mitochondrial size and shape, that is, mitochondrial dynamics, were overexpressed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and formed homo- and heterodimeric complexes with the voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), a key regulator of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability. MFF inserted into the interior hole of the VDAC1 ring using Arg225, Arg236, and Gln241 as key contact sites. A cell-permeable MFF Ser223-Leu243 d-enantiomeric peptidomimetic disrupted the MFF-VDAC1 complex, acutely depolarized mitochondria, and triggered cell death in heterogeneous tumor types, including drug-resistant melanoma, but had no effect on normal cells. In preclinical models, treatment with the MFF peptidomimetic was well-tolerated and demonstrated anticancer activity in patient-derived xenografts, primary breast and lung adenocarcinoma 3D organoids, and glioblastoma neurospheres. These data identify the MFF-VDAC1 complex as a novel regulator of mitochondrial cell death and an actionable therapeutic target in cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings describe mitochondrial fission regulation using a peptidomimetic agent that disturbs the MFF-VDAC complex and displays anticancer activity in multiple tumor models.See related commentary by Rao, p. 6074.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
33334013        	Targeting Acid Ceramidase to Improve the Radiosensitivity of Rectal Cancer.            	Previous work utilizing proteomic and immunohistochemical analyses has identified that high levels of acid ceramidase (AC) expression confers a poorer response to neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer. We aimed to assess the radiosensitising effect of biological and pharmacological manipulation of AC and elucidate the underlying mechanism. AC manipulation in three colorectal cancer cell lines (HT29, HCT116 and LIM1215) was achieved using siRNA and plasmid overexpression. Carmofur and a novel small molecular inhibitor (LCL521) were used as pharmacological AC inhibitors. Using clonogenic assays, we demonstrate that an siRNA knockdown of AC enhanced X-ray radiosensitivity across all colorectal cancer cell lines compared to a non-targeting control siRNA, and conversely, AC protein overexpression increased radioresistance. Using CRISPR gene editing, we also generated AC knockout HCT116 cells that were significantly more radiosensitive compared to AC-expressing cells. Similarly, two patient-derived organoid models containing relatively low AC expression were found to be comparatively more radiosensitive than three other models containing higher levels of AC. Additionally, AC inhibition using carmofur and LCL521 in three colorectal cancer cell lines increased cellular radiosensitivity. Decreased AC protein led to significant poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavage and apoptosis post-irradiation, which was shown to be executed through a p53-dependent process. Our study demonstrates that expression of AC within colorectal cancer cell lines modulates the cellular response to radiation, and particularly that AC inhibition leads to significantly enhanced radiosensitivity through an elevation in apoptosis. This work further solidifies AC as a target for improving radiotherapy treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer.	
27826057        	Adenylyl cyclase 5 links changes in calcium homeostasis to cAMP-dependent cyst growth in polycystic liver disease.            	Genetic defects in polycystin-1 or -2 (PC1 or PC2) cause polycystic liver disease associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PLD-ADPKD). Progressive cyst growth is sustained by a cAMP-dependent Ras/ERK/HIFα pathway, leading to increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) signaling. In PC2-defective cholangiocytes, cAMP production in response to [Ca2+]ER depletion is increased, while store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), intracellular and endoplasmic reticulum [Ca2+]ER levels are reduced. We investigated whether the adenylyl cyclases, AC5 and AC6, which can be inhibited by Ca2+, are activated by the ER chaperone STIM1. This would result in cAMP/PKA-dependent Ras/ERK/HIFα pathway activation in PC2-defective cells, in response to [Ca2+]ER depletion.                PC2/AC6 double conditional knockout (KO) mice were generated (Pkd2/AC6 KO) and compared to Pkd2 KO mice. The AC5 inhibitor SQ22,536 or AC5 siRNA were used in isolated cholangiocytes while the inhibitor was used in biliary organoid and animals; liver tissues were harvested for histochemical analysis.                When comparing Pkd2/AC6 KO to Pkd2 KO mice, no decrease in liver cyst size was found, and cellular cAMP after [Ca2+]ER depletion only decreased by 12%. Conversely, in PC2-defective cells, inhibition of AC5 significantly reduced cAMP production, pERK1/2 expression and VEGF-A secretion. AC5 inhibitors significantly reduced growth of biliary organoids derived from Pkd2 KO and Pkd2/AC6 KO mice. In vivo treatment with SQ22,536 significantly reduced liver cystic area and cell proliferation in PC2-defective mice. After [Ca2+]ER depletion in PC2-defective cells, STIM1 interacts with AC5 but not with Orai1, the Ca2+ channel that mediates SOCE.                [Ca2+]ER depletion in PC2-defective cells activates AC5 and results in stimulation of cAMP/ERK1-2 signaling, VEGF production and cyst growth. This mechanism may represent a novel therapeutic target.                Polycystic liver diseases are characterized by progressive cyst growth until their complications mandate surgery or liver transplantation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that inhibiting cell proliferation, which is induced by increased levels of cAMP, may represent a novel therapeutic target to slow the progression of the disease.

23712846        	Lgr4 regulates mammary gland development and stem cell activity through the pluripotency transcription factor Sox2.            	The key signaling networks regulating mammary stem cells are poorly defined. The leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor (Lgr) family has been implicated in intestinal, gastric, and epidermal stem cell functions. We investigated whether Lgr4 functions in mammary gland development and mammary stem cells. We found that Lgr4(-/-) mice had delayed ductal development, fewer terminal end buds, and decreased side-branching. Crucially, the mammary stem cell repopulation capacity was severely impaired. Mammospheres from Lgr4(-/-) mice showed decreased Wnt signaling. Wnt3a treatment prevented the adverse effects of Lgr4 loss on organoid formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Sox2 expression was controlled by the Lgr4/Wnt/β-catenin/Lef1 pathway. Importantly, Sox2 overexpression restored the in vivo mammary regeneration potential of Lgr4(-/-) mammary stem cells. Therefore, Lgr4 activates Sox2 to regulate mammary development and stem cell functions via Wnt/β-catenin/Lef1.                © AlphaMed Press.	
31559706        	The novel BET-CBP/p300 dual inhibitor NEO2734 is active in SPOP mutant and wild-type prostate cancer.            	CULLIN3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-binding adaptor gene SPOP is frequently mutated in prostate cancer (PCa). PCa harboring SPOP hotspot mutants (e.g., F133V) are resistant to BET inhibitors because of aberrant elevation of BET proteins. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized mutation Q165P at the edge of SPOP MATH domain in primary and metastatic PCa of a patient. The Q165P mutation causes structural changes in the MATH domain and impairs SPOP dimerization and substrate degradation. Different from F133V hotspot mutant tumors, Q165P mutant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids were modestly sensitive to the BET inhibitor JQ1. Accordingly, protein levels of AR, BRD4 and downstream effectors such as RAC1 and phosphorylated AKT were not robustly elevated in Q165P mutant cells as in F133V mutant cells. However, NEO2734, a novel dual inhibitor of BET and CBP/p300, is active in both hotspot mutant (F133V) and non-hotspot mutant (Q165P) PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. These data provide a strong rationale to clinically investigate the anti-cancer efficacy of NEO2734 in SPOP-mutated PCa patients.                © 2019 The Authors.

32705632        	Identification and Isolation of Human LGR5+ Cells Using an Antibody-Based Strategy.            	Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) has been identified as a marker of stem cells across multiple tissues. Lgr5-expressing cells are also regulators of tissue homeostasis and wound repair, and drivers of carcinogenic progression. The majority of information about Lgr5-expressing cells derives from genetically engineered mouse models. Human studies have been limited by a lack of specific reagents and experimental procedures for the purification of these cells. We recently demonstrated that antibody-based purification can be used to obtain viable LGR5-expressing cells from human primary tissues and patient derived organoids. Here, we provide detailed methods for the purification of these cells from colonic epithelial organoids generated from patient-derived tissues, from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived intestinal organoids, and from freshly isolated patient tissue intestinal crypts. These methods will facilitate experimental analysis of human LGR5-expressing cells in development, wound healing, and cancer.	
33086677        	Systems Biology and Experimental Model Systems of Cancer.            	Over the past decade, we have witnessed an increasing number of large-scale studies that have provided multi-omics data by high-throughput sequencing approaches. This has particularly helped with identifying key (epi)genetic alterations in cancers. Importantly, aberrations that lead to the activation of signaling networks through the disruption of normal cellular homeostasis is seen both in cancer cells and also in the neighboring tumor microenvironment. Cancer systems biology approaches have enabled the efficient integration of experimental data with computational algorithms and the implementation of actionable targeted therapies, as the exceptions, for the treatment of cancer. Comprehensive multi-omics data obtained through the sequencing of tumor samples and experimental model systems will be important in implementing novel cancer systems biology approaches and increasing their efficacy for tailoring novel personalized treatment modalities in cancer. In this review, we discuss emerging cancer systems biology approaches based on multi-omics data derived from bulk and single-cell genomics studies in addition to existing experimental model systems that play a critical role in understanding (epi)genetic heterogeneity and therapy resistance in cancer.	
25478808        	Characterization of a new small bowel adenocarcinoma cell line and screening of anti-cancer drug against small bowel adenocarcinoma.            	Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis, and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in SBA remain unclear. Our aims were to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying SBA and to identify treatments by establishing and characterizing an SBA cell line and performing anti-cancer drug screening. SIAC1 cells, established from jejunal SBA, showed epithelial characteristics and formed organoids in 3D culture. SIAC1 cells had a heterozygous β-catenin deletion mutation, resulting in a stable β-catenin protein with enhanced Wnt/β-catenin activity. SIAC1 cells lacked MLH1 and MSH6 expression, and target genes such as TGFBR2 and ACVR2 showed frameshift mutations. Among 10 clinical SBA samples, 2 (20%) had interstitial deletions in β-catenin, expression of mismatch repair protein was aberrant in 4 (40%), and heterozygous frameshift mutations of three target genes were found in all 10 samples. On screening assay using 140 compounds, eribulin significantly inhibited SIAC1 cell growth both in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway via enhanced degradation of β-catenin. In conclusion, we established an SBA cell line with molecular characteristics similar to those of clinical SBA samples, including β-catenin deletion and mismatch repair protein deficiency, that will be useful for SBA research. Eribulin might be a candidate for SBA treatment due to its inhibitory effect on Wnt/β-catenin signaling.                Copyright © 2015 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

32499299        	First-in-Class Inhibitors of Oncogenic CHD1L with Preclinical Activity against Colorectal Cancer.            	Since the discovery of CHD1L in 2008, it has emerged as an oncogene implicated in the pathology and poor prognosis of a variety of cancers, including gastrointestinal cancers. However, a mechanistic understanding of CHD1L as a driver of colorectal cancer has been limited. Until now, there have been no reported inhibitors of CHD1L, also limiting its development as a molecular target. We sought to characterize the clinicopathologic link between CHD1L and colorectal cancer, determine the mechanism(s) by which CHD1L drives malignant colorectal cancer, and discover the first inhibitors with potential for novel treatments for colorectal cancer. The clinicopathologic characteristics associated with CHD1L expression were evaluated using microarray data from 585 patients with colorectal cancer. Further analysis of microarray data indicated that CHD1L may function through the Wnt/TCF pathway. Thus, we conducted knockdown and overexpression studies with CHD1L to determine its role in Wnt/TCF-driven epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We performed high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify the first CHD1L inhibitors. The mechanism of action, antitumor efficacy, and drug-like properties of lead CHD1L inhibitors were determined using biochemical assays, cell models, tumor organoids, patient-derived tumor organoids, and in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Lead CHD1L inhibitors display potent in vitro antitumor activity by reversing TCF-driven EMT. The best lead CHD1L inhibitor possesses drug-like properties in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic mouse models. This work validates CHD1L as a druggable target and establishes a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colorectal cancer.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30374120        	Evaluating the origin and virulence of a Helicobacter pylori cagA-positive strain isolated from a non-human primate.            	Helicobacter pylori cagA-positive strains are critically involved in the development of gastric cancer. Upon delivery into gastric epithelial cells via type IV secretion, the cagA-encoded CagA interacts with and thereby perturbs the pro-oncogenic phosphatase SHP2 and the polarity-regulating kinase PAR1b via the tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA-C/D segment and the CM sequence, respectively. Importantly, sequences spanning these binding regions exhibit variations among CagA proteins, which influence the pathobiological/oncogenic potential of individual CagA. Here we isolated an H. pylori strain (Hp_TH2099) naturally infecting the stomach of a housed macaque, indicating a zoonotic feature of H. pylori infection. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that Hp_TH2099 belongs to the hpAsia2 cluster and possesses ABC-type Western CagA, which contains hitherto unreported variations in both EPIYA-C and CM sequences. The CM variations almost totally abolished PAR1b binding. Whereas pTyr + 5 variation in the EPIYA-C segment potentiated SHP2-binding affinity, pTyr-2 variation dampened CagA tyrosine phosphorylation and thus impeded CagA-SHP2 complex formation. As opposed to the H. pylori standard strain, infection of mouse ES cell-derived gastric organoids with Hp_TH2099 failed to elicit CagA-dependent epithelial destruction. Thus, the macaque-isolated H. pylori showed low virulence due to attenuated CagA activity through multiple substitutions in the sequences involved in binding with SHP2 and PAR1b.	
30871493        	A multicenter open-label phase II trial to evaluate nivolumab and ipilimumab for 2nd line therapy in elderly patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer (RAMONA).            	Advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is frequently diagnosed in elderly patients. The impact of 2nd line chemotherapy is poorly defined. Recent data demonstrated effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors in different squamous cell carcinomas. Therefore, we assess combined nivolumab/ipilimumab as 2nd line therapy in elderly ESCC patients.                RAMONA is a multicenter open-label phase II trial. The primary objective is to demonstrate a significant survival benefit of nivolumab/ipilimumab in advanced ESCC compared to historical data of standard chemotherapy. Primary endpoint is therefore overall survival (OS). Major secondary objective is the evaluation of tolerability. Time to QoL deterioration will thus be determined as key secondary endpoint. Further secondary endpoints are tumor response, PFS and safety. We aim to recruit a total of n = 75 subjects that have to be > 65 years old. Eligibility is determined by the geriatric status (G8 screening and Deficit Accumulation Frailty Index (DAFI)). A safety assessment will be performed after a 3 cycle run-in phase of nivolumab (240 mg Q2W) to justify escalation for eligible patients to combined nivolumab (240 mg Q2W) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg Q6W), while the other patients will remain on nivolumab only. RAMONA also includes translational research sub-studies to identify predictive biomarkers, including PD-1 and PD-L1 evaluation at different time points, establishment of organoid cultures and microbiome analyses for response prediction.                The RAMONA trial aims to implement checkpoint inhibitors for elderly patients with advanced ESCC as second line therapy. Novel biomarkers for checkpoint-inhibitor response are analyzed in extensive translational sub-studies.                EudraCT Number: 2017-002056-86 ; NCT03416244 , registered: 31.1.2018.

29143738        	Bladder-cancer-associated mutations in RXRA activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors to drive urothelial proliferation.            	RXRA regulates transcription as part of a heterodimer with 14 other nuclear receptors, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Analysis from TCGA raised the possibility that hyperactive PPAR signaling, either due to PPAR gamma gene amplification or RXRA hot-spot mutation (S427F/Y) drives 20-25% of human bladder cancers. Here, we characterize mutant RXRA, demonstrating it induces enhancer/promoter activity in the context of RXRA/PPAR heterodimers in human bladder cancer cells. Structure-function studies indicate that the RXRA substitution allosterically regulates the PPAR AF2 domain via an aromatic interaction with the terminal tyrosine found in PPARs. In mouse urothelial organoids, PPAR agonism is sufficient to drive growth-factor-independent growth in the context of concurrent tumor suppressor loss. Similarly, mutant RXRA stimulates growth-factor-independent growth of Trp53/Kdm6a null bladder organoids. Mutant RXRA-driven growth of urothelium is reversible by PPAR inhibition, supporting PPARs as targetable drivers of bladder cancer.	
32814769        	Histone methyltransferase DOT1L coordinates AR and MYC stability in prostate cancer.            	The histone methyltransferase DOT1L methylates lysine 79 (K79) on histone H3 and is involved in Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) fusion leukemogenesis; however, its role in prostate cancer (PCa) is undefined. Here we show that DOT1L is overexpressed in PCa and is associated with poor outcome. Genetic and chemical inhibition of DOT1L selectively impaired the viability of androgen receptor (AR)-positive PCa cells and organoids, including castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant cells. The sensitivity of AR-positive cells is due to a distal K79 methylation-marked enhancer in the MYC gene bound by AR and DOT1L not present in AR-negative cells. DOT1L inhibition leads to reduced MYC expression and upregulation of MYC-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligases HECTD4 and MYCBP2, which promote AR and MYC degradation. This leads to further repression of MYC in a negative feed forward manner. Thus DOT1L selectively regulates the tumorigenicity of AR-positive prostate cancer cells and is a promising therapeutic target for PCa.	
27196083        	Validation of Novel Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Progression by the Combination of Bioinformatics, Clinical and Functional Studies.            	The identification and validation of biomarkers for clinical applications remains an important issue for improving diagnostics and therapy in many diseases, including prostate cancer. Gene expression profiles are routinely applied to identify diagnostic and predictive biomarkers or novel targets for cancer. However, only few predictive markers identified in silico have also been validated for clinical, functional or mechanistic relevance in disease progression. In this study, we have used a broad, bioinformatics-based approach to identify such biomarkers across a spectrum of progression stages, including normal and tumor-adjacent, premalignant, primary and late stage lesions. Bioinformatics data mining combined with clinical validation of biomarkers by sensitive, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), followed by functional evaluation of candidate genes in disease-relevant processes, such as cancer cell proliferation, motility and invasion. From 300 initial candidates, eight genes were selected for validation by several layers of data mining and filtering. For clinical validation, differential mRNA expression of selected genes was measured by qRT-PCR in 197 clinical prostate tissue samples including normal prostate, compared against histologically benign and cancerous tissues. Based on the qRT-PCR results, significantly different mRNA expression was confirmed in normal prostate versus malignant PCa samples (for all eight genes), but also in cancer-adjacent tissues, even in the absence of detectable cancer cells, thus pointing to the possibility of pronounced field effects in prostate lesions. For the validation of the functional properties of these genes, and to demonstrate their putative relevance for disease-relevant processes, siRNA knock-down studies were performed in both 2D and 3D organotypic cell culture models. Silencing of three genes (DLX1, PLA2G7 and RHOU) in the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and VCaP by siRNA resulted in marked growth arrest and cytotoxicity, particularly in 3D organotypic cell culture conditions. In addition, silencing of PLA2G7, RHOU, ACSM1, LAMB1 and CACNA1D also resulted in reduced tumor cell invasion in PC3 organoid cultures. For PLA2G7 and RHOU, the effects of siRNA silencing on proliferation and cell-motility could also be confirmed in 2D monolayer cultures. In conclusion, DLX1 and RHOU showed the strongest potential as useful clinical biomarkers for PCa diagnosis, further validated by their functional roles in PCa progression. These candidates may be useful for more reliable identification of relapses or therapy failures prior to the recurrence local or distant metastases.	
26306560        	Stromal ING1 expression induces a secretory phenotype and correlates with breast cancer patient survival.            	Previous studies have established that levels of the Inhibitor of Growth 1(ING1) tumor suppressor are reduced in a significant proportion of different cancer types. Here we analyzed levels of ING1 in breast cancer patients to determine its prognostic significance as a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis.                We used automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) to determine the levels of ING1 in the tumor associated stromal cells of 462 breast cancer samples. To better understand how high ING1 levels affect nearby epithelium, we measured the levels of cytokines and secreted matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), using an ELISA based assay in mammary fibroblasts overexpressing ING1. These cells were also used in a 3-dimensional co-culture with MCF7 cells to determine the effect of released MMPs and other cytokines on growing colonies.                We find that high levels of ING1 in stroma are associated with tumor grade (p = 0.001) and size (p = 0.02), and inversely associated with patient survival (p = 0.0001) in luminal, but not in non-luminal cancers, suggesting that high stromal ING1 promotes cancer development. In this group of patients ING1 could also predict patient survival and act as a biomarker (HR = 2.125). While ING1 increased or decreased the expression of different cytokines, ING1 also increased the levels of MMP1, MMP3 and MMP10 by 5-8 fold, and concomitantly decreased levels of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases TIMP2, TIMP3 and TIMP4 by 1.5-3.3 fold, resulting in significant increases in MMP activity as determined by zymography. Co-culturing of MCF7 cells with stromal cells expressing ING1 in 3-dimensional organoid cultures suggested that MCF7 colonies were less well defined, suggesting that secreted MMPs might promote migration.                These data indicate that stromal ING1 expression can predict the survival of patients with luminal breast cancer. High levels of ING1 in stromal cells can promote the development of breast cancer through increased expression and release of MMPs and down regulation of TIMPs, which may be an underlying mechanism of reduced patient survival.	
32064449        	Is There a Trojan Horse to Aggressive Pancreatic Cancer Biology? A Review of the Trypsin-PAR2 Axis to Proliferation, Early Invasion, and Metastasis.            	Purpose: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal of solid tumors and is associated with aggressive cancer biology. The purpose is to review the role of trypsin and effect on molecular and cellular processes potentially explaining the aggressive biology in pancreatic cancer. Methods: A narrative literature review of studies investigating trypsin and its effect on protease systems in cancer, with special reference to pancreatic cancer biology. Results: Proteases, such as trypsin, provides a significant advantage to developing tumors through the ability to remodel the extracellular matrix, promote cell invasion and migration, and facilitate angiogenesis. Trypsin is a digestive enzyme produced by the exocrine pancreas that is also related to mechanisms of proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Several of these mechanisms may be co-regulated or influenced by activation of proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2). The current role in pancreatic cancer is not clear but emerging data suggest several potential mechanisms. Trypsin may act as a Trojan horse in the pancreatic gland, facilitating several molecular pathways from the onset, which leads to rapid progression of the disease. Pancreatic cancer cell lines containing PAR-2 proliferate upon exposure to trypsin, whereas cancer cell lines not containing PAR-2 fail to proliferate upon trypsin expression. Several mechanisms of action include a proinflammatory environment, signals inducing proliferation and migration, and direct and indirect evidence for mechanisms promoting invasion and metastasis. Novel techniques (such as organoid models) and increased understanding of mechanisms (such as the microbiome) may yield improved understanding into the role of trypsin in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Conclusion: Trypsin is naturally present in the pancreatic gland and may experience pathological activation intracellularly and in the neoplastic environment, which speeds up molecular mechanisms of proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Further investigation of these processes will provide important insights into how pancreatic cancer evolves, and suggest new ways for treatment.                © Kjetil Søreide et al. 2020; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.	
31292543        	A human liver cell atlas reveals heterogeneity and epithelial progenitors.            	The human liver is an essential multifunctional organ. The incidence of liver diseases is rising and there are limited treatment options. However, the cellular composition of the liver remains poorly understood. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of about 10,000 cells from normal liver tissue from nine human donors to construct a human liver cell atlas. Our analysis identified previously unknown subtypes of endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatocytes, with transcriptome-wide zonation of some of these populations. We show that the EPCAM+ population is heterogeneous, comprising hepatocyte-biased and cholangiocyte populations as well as a TROP2int progenitor population with strong potential to form bipotent liver organoids. As a proof-of-principle, we used our atlas to unravel the phenotypic changes that occur in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and in human hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells engrafted into a mouse liver. Our human liver cell atlas provides a powerful resource to enable the discovery of previously unknown cell types in normal and diseased livers.	
30232288        	Essential role of IFN-γ in T cell-associated intestinal inflammation.            	Paneth cells contribute to small intestinal homeostasis by secreting antimicrobial peptides and constituting the intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche. Certain T cell-mediated enteropathies are characterized by extensive Paneth cell depletion coincident with mucosal destruction and dysbiosis. In this study, mechanisms of intestinal crypt injury have been investigated by characterizing responses of mouse intestinal organoids (enteroids) in coculture with mouse T lymphocytes. Activated T cells induced enteroid damage, reduced Paneth cell and Lgr5+ ISC mRNA levels, and induced Paneth cell death through a caspase-3/7-dependent mechanism. IFN-γ mediated these effects, because IFN-γ receptor-null enteroids were unaffected by activated T cells. In mice, administration of IFN-γ induced enteropathy with crypt hyperplasia, villus shortening, Paneth cell depletion, and modified ISC marker expression. IFN-γ exacerbated radiation enteritis, which was ameliorated by treatment with a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor. Thus, IFN-γ induced Paneth cell death and impaired regeneration of small intestinal epithelium in vivo, suggesting that IFN-γ may be a useful target for treating defective mucosal regeneration in enteric inflammation.	
31991585        	Design and Synthesis of Arf1-Targeting γ-Dipeptides as Potential Agents against Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.            	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths and calls for new druggable targets. We have previously highlighted the critical role of ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (Arf1) activation in HNSCC. In the present study, we address the question whether targeting Arf1 could be proposed as a valuable strategy against HNSCC.                We rationally designed and synthesized constrained ATC-based (4-amino-(methyl)-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid) γ-dipeptides to block Arf1 activation. We evaluated the effects of these γ-dipeptides in HNSCC cells: The cell viability was determined in 2D and 3D cell cultures after 72 h treatment and Arf1 protein levels and activity were assessed by GGA3 pull-down and Western blotting assays.                Targeting Arf1 offers a valuable strategy to counter HNSCC. Our new Arf1-targeting compounds revealed a strong in vitro cytotoxicity against HNSCC cells, through inhibiting Arf1 activation and its downstream pathways.                Arf1-targeting γ-dipeptides developed in this study may represent a promising targeted therapeutic to improve managing the HNSCC disease.	
31614493        	Human Colorectal Cancer from the Perspective of Mouse Models.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease that includes both hereditary and sporadic types of tumors. Tumor initiation and growth is driven by mutational or epigenetic changes that alter the function or expression of multiple genes. The genes predominantly encode components of various intracellular signaling cascades. In this review, we present mouse intestinal cancer models that include alterations in the Wnt, Hippo, p53, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathways; models of impaired DNA mismatch repair and chemically induced tumorigenesis are included. Based on their molecular biology characteristics and mutational and epigenetic status, human colorectal carcinomas were divided into four so-called consensus molecular subtype (CMS) groups. It was shown subsequently that the CMS classification system could be applied to various cell lines derived from intestinal tumors and tumor-derived organoids. Although the CMS system facilitates characterization of human CRC, individual mouse models were not assigned to some of the CMS groups. Thus, we also indicate the possible assignment of described animal models to the CMS group. This might be helpful for selection of a suitable mouse strain to study a particular type of CRC.	
26455770        	Obesity promotes colonic stem cell expansion during cancer initiation.            	There is an urgent need to elucidate the mechanistic links between obesity and colon cancer. Convincing evidence for the role of Lgr5(+) stem cells in colon tumorigenesis has been established; however, the influence of obesity on stem cell maintenance is unknown. We assessed the effects of high fat (HF) feeding on colonic stem cell maintenance during cancer initiation (AOM induced) and the responsiveness of stem cells to adipokine signaling pathways. The number of colonic GFP(+) stem cells was significantly higher in the AOM-injected HF group compared to the LF group. The Lgr5(+) stem cells of the HF fed mice exhibited statistically significant increases in cell proliferation and decreases in apoptosis in response to AOM injection compared to the LF group. Colonic organoid cultures from lean mice treated with an adiponectin receptor agonist exhibited a reduction in Lgr5-GPF(+) stem cell number and an increase in apoptosis; however, this response was diminished in the organoid cultures from obese mice. These results suggest that the responsiveness of colonic stem cells to adiponectin in diet-induced obesity is impaired and may contribute to the stem cell accumulation observed in obesity.

23314290        	The CSF-1 receptor fashions the intestinal stem cell niche.            	Gastrointestinal (GI) homeostasis requires the action of multiple pathways. There is some controversy regarding whether small intestine (SI) Paneth cells (PCs) play a central role in orchestrating crypt architecture and their relationship with Lgr5+ve stem cells. Nevertheless, we previously showed that germline CSF-1 receptor (Csf1r) knock out (KO) or Csf1 mutation is associated with an absence of mature PC, reduced crypt proliferation and lowered stem cell gene, Lgr5 expression. Here we show the additional loss of CD24, Bmi1 and Olfm4 expression in the KO crypts and a high resolution 3D localization of CSF-1R mainly to PC. The induction of GI-specific Csf1r deletion in young adult mice also led to PC loss over a period of weeks, in accord with the anticipated long life span of PC, changed distribution of proliferating cells and this was with a commensurate loss of Lgr5 and other stem cell marker gene expression. By culturing SI organoids, we further show that the Csf1r(-/-) defect in PC production is intrinsic to epithelial cells as well as definitively affecting stem cell activity. These results show that CSF-1R directly supports PC maturation and that in turn PCs fashion the intestinal stem cell niche.                Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
24752784        	Dependence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stem cells on CRPC-associated fibroblasts.            	We previously established a role for cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in enhancing the self-renewal and differentiation potentials of putative prostate cancer stem cells (CSC). Our published work focused on androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) using the conditional Pten deletion mouse model. Employing the same model, we now describe the interaction of CAF and CSC in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CAF isolated from ADPC (ADPCAF) and from CRPC (CRPCAF) were compared in terms of their ability to support organoid formation and tumor initiation by CSC from CRPC (CRPCSC) in vitro and in vivo. CRPCSC formed spheroids in vitro and well-differentiated glandular structures under the renal capsules of recipient mice in vivo more effectively in the presence of CRPCAF compared to ADPCAF. Furthermore, whereas CSC with CAF from ADPC formed mostly well-differentiated tumors in our previous study, we now show that CRPCSC, when combined with CRPCAF (but not ADPCAF), can form aggressive, poorly-differentiated tumors. The potential of CRPCAF to support organoid/tumor formation by CRPCSC remained greater even when compared to 10-fold more ADPCAF, suggesting that paracrine factors produced specifically by CRPCAF preferentially potentiate the stemness and tumorigenic properties of the corresponding CSC. This apparently unique property of CRPCAF was notable when the CAF and CSC were grafted in either intact or castrated recipient mice. In both environments, CRPCAF induced in the epithelial compartment higher proliferative activity compared to ADPCAF, indicated by a higher Ki67 index. Factors released by CRPCAF to regulate CRPCSC may be targeted to develop novel therapeutic approaches to manage advanced prostate cancer.                © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
29782013        	Mouse- and Human-derived Primary Gastric Epithelial Monolayer Culture for the Study of Regeneration.            	In vitro studies of gastric wound repair typically involves the use of gastric cancer cell lines in a scratch-wound assay of cellular proliferation and migration. One critical limitation of such assays, however, is their homogenous assortment of cellular types. Repair is a complex process which demands the interaction of several cell types. Therefore, to study a culture devoid of cellular subtypes, is a concern that must be overcome if we are to understand the repair process. The gastric organoid model may alleviate this issue whereby the heterogeneous collection of cell types closely reflects that of the gastric epithelium or other native tissues in vivo. Demonstrated here is a novel, in vitro scratch-wound assay derived from human or mouse 3-dimensional organoids which can then be transferred to a gastric epithelial monolayer as either intact organoids or as a single cell suspension of dissociated organoids. The goal of the protocol is to establish organoid-derived gastric epithelial monolayers that can be used in a novel scratch-wound assay system to study gastric regeneration.	
32781084        	RNA Polymerase II-Associated Factor 1 Regulates Stem Cell Features of Pancreatic Cancer Cells, Independently of the PAF1 Complex, via Interactions With PHF5A and DDX3.            	It is not clear how pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCs) are regulated, resulting in ineffective treatments for pancreatic cancer. PAF1, a RNA polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) component, maintains pluripotency of stem cells, by unclear mechanisms, and is a marker of CSCs. We investigated mechanisms by which PAF1 maintains CSCs and contributes to development of pancreatic tumors.                Pancreatic cancer cell lines were engineered to knockdown PAF1 using inducible small hairpin RNAs. These cells were grown as orthotopic tumors in athymic nude mice and PAF1 knockdown was induced by administration of doxycycline in drinking water. Tumor growth and metastasis were monitored via IVIS imaging. CSCs were isolated from pancreatic cancer cell populations using flow cytometry and characterized by tumor sphere formation, tumor formation in nude mice, and expression of CSC markers. Isolated CSCs were depleted of PAF1 using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. PAF1-regulated genes in CSCs were identified via RNA-seq and PCR array analyses of cells with PAF1 knockdown. Proteins that interact with PAF1 in CSCs were identified by immunoprecipitations and mass spectrometry. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of CSCs to confirm the binding of the PAF1 sub-complex to target genes.                Pancreatic cancer cells depleted of PAF1 formed smaller and fewer tumor spheres in culture and orthotopic tumors and metastases in mice. Isolated CSCs depleted of PAF1 downregulated markers of self-renewal (NANOG, SOX9, and β-CATENIN), of CSCs (CD44v6, and ALDH1), and the metastasis-associated gene signature, compared to CSCs without knockdown of PAF1. The role of PAF1 in CSC maintenance was independent of its RNA polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex component identity. We identified DDX3 and PHF5A as proteins that interact with PAF1 in CSCs and demonstrated that the PAF1-PHF5A-DDX3 sub-complex bound to the promoter region of Nanog, whose product regulates genes that control stemness. Levels of the PAF1-DDX3 and PAF1-PHF5A were increased and co-localized in human pancreatic tumor specimens, human pancreatic tumor-derived organoids, and organoids derived from tumors of KPC mice, compared with controls. Binding of DDX3 and PAF1 to the Nanog promoter, and the self-renewal capacity of CSCs, were decreased in cells incubated with the DDX3 inhibitor RK-33. CSCs depleted of PAF1 downregulated genes that regulate stem cell features (Flot2, Taz, Epcam, Erbb2, Foxp1, Abcc5, Ddr1, Muc1, Pecam1, Notch3, Aldh1a3, Foxa2, Plat, and Lif).                In pancreatic CSCs, PAF1 interacts with DDX3 and PHF5A to regulate expression of NANOG and other genes that regulate stemness. Knockdown of PAF1 reduces the ability of orthotopic pancreatic tumors to develop and progress in mice and their numbers of CSCs. Strategies to target the PAF1-PHF5A-DDX3 complex might be developed to slow or inhibit progression of pancreatic cancer.                Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

30641089        	Myositis ossificans mimicking metaplastic breast cancer on core needle biopsy.            	Myositis ossificans (MO) is an uncommon myofibroblastic proliferation that may closely mimic sarcoma. A 33-year old woman presented with a 2-cm breast mass. A core needle biopsy showed highly cellular spindle cell proliferations with atypia and high proliferation activity. Focal areas of immature osteoid-like matrix were seen. After immunohistochemical analysis, a diagnosis of metaplastic breast cancer was made. Because of the proximity of the tumor to the rib, resection of the tumor including partial resection of the rib was carried out. Complete examination of the excised lesion allowed the correct diagnosis of MO. Only the resection specimens contained a predominance of mature organoid bone tissue admixed with variably cellular myofibroblastic proliferations with the typical zonal pattern, characteristic of MO. The diagnosis of MO was not possible on the initially performed core needle biopsy because biopsy material reflected only the central proliferative portion of the lesion showing increased pleomorphism and early osteoid formation. This case highlights the pitfall related to this unusual presentation of a benign lesion and points to the necessity to include MO in the differential diagnosis of triple-negative metaplastic breast cancer.

30679176        	Pleiotropic Effects of PPARD Accelerate Colorectal Tumorigenesis, Progression, and Invasion.            	APC mutations activate aberrant β-catenin signaling to drive initiation of colorectal cancer; however, colorectal cancer progression requires additional molecular mechanisms. PPAR-delta (PPARD), a downstream target of β-catenin, is upregulated in colorectal cancer. However, promotion of intestinal tumorigenesis following deletion of PPARD in Apcmin mice has raised questions about the effects of PPARD on aberrant β-catenin activation and colorectal cancer. In this study, we used mouse models of PPARD overexpression or deletion combined with APC mutation (ApcΔ580 ) in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) to elucidate the contributions of PPARD in colorectal cancer. Overexpression or deletion of PPARD in IEC augmented or suppressed β-catenin activation via up- or downregulation of BMP7/TAK1 signaling and strongly promoted or suppressed colorectal cancer, respectively. Depletion of PPARD in human colorectal cancer organoid cells inhibited BMP7/β-catenin signaling and suppressed organoid self-renewal. Treatment with PPARD agonist GW501516 enhanced colorectal cancer tumorigenesis in ApcΔ580 mice, whereas treatment with PPARD antagonist GSK3787 suppressed tumorigenesis. PPARD expression was significantly higher in human colorectal cancer-invasive fronts versus their paired tumor centers and adenomas. Reverse-phase protein microarray and validation studies identified PPARD-mediated upregulation of other proinvasive pathways: connexin 43, PDGFRβ, AKT1, EIF4G1, and CDK1. Our data demonstrate that PPARD strongly potentiates multiple tumorigenic pathways to promote colorectal cancer progression and invasiveness. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings address long-standing, important, and unresolved questions related to the potential role of PPARD in APC mutation-dependent colorectal tumorigenesis by showing PPARD activation enhances APC mutation-dependent tumorigenesis.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
33631296        	Targeting stemness of cancer stem cells to fight colorectal cancers.            	Cancer initiating/ stem cells (CSCs) undergo self-renewal and differentiation that contributes to tumor initiation, recurrence and metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Targeting of colorectal cancer stem cells (CCSCs) holds significant promise in eradicating cancer cells and ultimately curing patients with cancer. In this review, we will introduce the current progress of CCSC studies, including the specific surface markers of CCSCs, the intrinsic signaling pathways that regulate the stemness and differentiation characteristics of CCSCs, and the tumor organoid model for CCSC research. We will focus on how these studies will lead to the progress in targeting specific surface markers or signaling pathways on CCSCs by monoclonal antibodies, or by natural or synthetic compounds, or by immunotherapy. As CSCs are highly heterogeneous and plastic, we suggest that combinatory approaches that target the stemness network may represent an important strategy for eradicating cancers.

30366930        	IL1-Induced JAK/STAT Signaling Is Antagonized by TGFβ to Shape CAF Heterogeneity in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is poorly responsive to therapies and histologically contains a paucity of neoplastic cells embedded within a dense desmoplastic stroma. Within the stroma, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) secrete tropic factors and extracellular matrix components, and have been implicated in PDAC progression and chemotherapy resistance. We recently identified two distinct CAF subtypes characterized by either myofibroblastic or inflammatory phenotypes; however, the mechanisms underlying their diversity and their roles in PDAC remain unknown. Here, we use organoid and mouse models to identify TGFβ and IL1 as tumor-secreted ligands that promote CAF heterogeneity. We show that IL1 induces LIF expression and downstream JAK/STAT activation to generate inflammatory CAFs and demonstrate that TGFβ antagonizes this process by downregulating IL1R1 expression and promoting differentiation into myofibroblasts. Our results provide a mechanism through which distinct fibroblast niches are established in the PDAC microenvironment and illuminate strategies to selectively target CAFs that support tumor growth. SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the mechanisms that determine CAF heterogeneity in PDAC is a prerequisite for the rational development of approaches that selectively target tumor-promoting CAFs. Here, we identify an IL1-induced signaling cascade that leads to JAK/STAT activation and promotes an inflammatory CAF state, suggesting multiple strategies to target these cells in vivo.

26130650        	IL6/JAK1/STAT3 Signaling Blockade in Endometrial Cancer Affects the ALDHhi/CD126+ Stem-like Component and Reduces Tumor Burden.            	Cancer stem-like cells (CSC) may be critical to maintain the malignant behavior of solid and hematopoietic cancers. Recently, patients with endometrial cancer whose tumors expressed high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), a detoxifying enzyme characteristic of many progenitor and stem cells, exhibited a relative reduction in survival compared with patients with low levels of ALDH. Given evidence of its role as a CSC marker, we hypothesized that high level of ALDH activity (ALDH(hi)) in a tumor might positively correlate with the presence of stem- and progenitor-like tumor cells in this disease setting. In support of this hypothesis, ALDH could be used to enrich for CSC in endometrial cancer cell lines and primary tumors, as illustrated by the increased tumor-initiating capacity of ALDH(hi) cells in immunodeficient mice. ALDH(hi) cells also exhibited greater clonogenic and organoid-forming capacity compared with ALDH(lo) cells. Notably, the number of ALDH(hi) cells in tumor cell lines and primary tumors inversely correlated with differentiation grade. Expression analysis revealed upregulation of IL6 receptor subunits and signal transducers CD126 and GP130 in ALDH(hi) endometrial cancer cells. Accordingly, targeted inhibition of the IL6 receptor and its downstream effectors JAK1 and STAT3 dramatically reduced tumor cell growth. Overall, our results provide a preclinical rationale to target IL6 or its effector functions as a novel therapeutic option in endometrial cancer.                ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30479121        	MALDI-MSI of Immunotherapy: Mapping the EGFR-Targeting Antibody Cetuximab in 3D Colon-Cancer Cell Cultures.            	Immunotherapies are treatments that use a patient's immune system to combat disease. One important type of immunotherapy employed in cancer treatments is the delivery of monoclonal antibodies to block growth receptors. In this manuscript, we develop a methodology that enables accurate and simple evaluation of antibody-type drug delivery using MALDI-MSI. To overcome the mass-range limitation that prevents the detection of large therapeutic antibodies, we used in situ reduction and alkylation to break disulfide bonds to generate smaller fragments. These smaller fragments are more readily ionized and detected by MALDI-MSI without loss of spatial information on the parent drug. As a proof of concept study, we evaluated the distribution of cetuximab in 3D colon cell cultures. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of epidermal-growth-factor receptor (EGFR), which is often overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and mediates cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Cetuximab directly inhibits tumor growth and metastasis and induces apoptosis. By performing on-tissue reduction followed by MALDI-MSI analysis, we successfully mapped the time-dependent penetration and distribution of cetuximab in spheroids derived from two different colon-cancer cell lines (HT-29 and DLD-1). The localization patterns were further confirmed with IF staining of the drug. Changes in other biomolecules following drug treatment were also observed, including the elevation of ATP in spheroids. The developed method has also been applied to map cetuximab distribution in patient-derived colorectal-tumor organoids (CTOs). Overall, we believe this powerful label-free approach will be useful for visualizing the heterogeneous distribution of antibody drugs in tissues and tumors and will help to monitor and optimize their use in the clinic.	
33055221        	A Wnt-Induced Phenotypic Switch in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Inhibits EMT in Colorectal Cancer.            	Tumor progression is recognized as a result of an evolving cross-talk between tumor cells and their surrounding nontransformed stroma. Although Wnt signaling has been intensively studied in colorectal cancer, it remains unclear whether activity in the tumor-associated stroma contributes to malignancy. To specifically interfere with stromal signals, we generated Wnt-independent tumor organoids that secrete the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1. Subcutaneous transplantation into immunocompetent as well as immunodeficient mice resulted in a strong reduction of tumor growth. Histologic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that Sfrp1 induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in tumor cells without affecting tumor-intrinsic Wnt signaling, suggesting involvement of nonimmune stromal cells. Blockage of canonical signaling using Sfrp1, Dkk1, or fibroblast-specific genetic ablation of β-catenin strongly decreased the number of cancer-associated myofibroblasts (myCAF). Wnt activity in CAFs was linked with distinct subtypes, where low and high levels induced an inflammatory-like CAF (iCAF) subtype or contractile myCAFs, respectively. Coculture of tumor organoids with iCAFs resulted in significant upregulation of EMT markers, while myCAFs reverted this phenotype. In summary, we show that tumor growth and malignancy are differentially regulated via distinct fibroblast subtypes under the influence of juxtacrine Wnt signals. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides evidence for Wnt-induced functional diversity of colorectal cancer-associated fibroblasts, representing a non-cell autonomous mechanism for colon cancer progression.

31588046        	The RNA Helicase DDX6 Controls Cellular Plasticity by Modulating P-Body Homeostasis.            	Post-transcriptional mechanisms have the potential to influence complex changes in gene expression, yet their role in cell fate transitions remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that suppression of the RNA helicase DDX6 endows human and mouse primed embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with a differentiation-resistant, "hyper-pluripotent" state, which readily reprograms to a naive state resembling the preimplantation embryo. We further demonstrate that DDX6 plays a key role in adult progenitors where it controls the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in a context-dependent manner. Mechanistically, DDX6 mediates the translational suppression of target mRNAs in P-bodies. Upon loss of DDX6 activity, P-bodies dissolve and release mRNAs encoding fate-instructive transcription and chromatin factors that re-enter the ribosome pool. Increased translation of these targets impacts cell fate by rewiring the enhancer, heterochromatin, and DNA methylation landscapes of undifferentiated cell types. Collectively, our data establish a link between P-body homeostasis, chromatin organization, and stem cell potency.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
33435170        	A 3D View of Colorectal Cancer Models in Predicting Therapeutic Responses and Resistance.            	Although there have been many advances in recent years for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), it still remains the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Many patients with late stage CRC display resistance to multiple different therapeutics. An important aspect in developing effective therapeutics for CRC patients is understanding the interactions that take place in the tumor microenvironment (TME), as it has been shown to contribute to drug resistance in vivo. Much research over the past 100 years has focused on 2D monolayer cultures or in vivo studies, however, the efficacy in translating these to the clinic is very low. More recent studies are turning towards developing an effective 3D model of CRC that is clinically relevant, that can recapitulate the TME in vitro and bridge the gap between 2D cultures and in vivo studies, with the aim of reducing the use of animal models in the future. This review summarises the advantages and limitations of different 3D CRC models. It emphasizes how different 3D models may be optimised to study cellular and extracellular interactions that take place in the TME of CRC in an effort to allow the development of more translatable effective treatment options for patients.	
26230325        	Intestinal Commitment and Maturation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Is Independent of Exogenous FGF4 and R-spondin1.            	Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a central role in guiding the differentiation of the posterior parts of the primitive gut tube into intestinal structures in vivo and some studies suggest that FGF4 is another crucial factor for intestinal development. The aim of this study was to define the effects of Wnt and FGF4 on intestinal commitment in vitro by establishing conditions for differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) into posterior endoderm (hindgut) and further to self-renewing intestinal-like organoids. The most prominent induction of the well-established intestinal marker gene CDX2 was achieved when hPSC-derived definitive endoderm cells were treated with Wnt agonist molecule CHIR99021 during differentiation to hindgut. FGF4 was found to be dispensable during intestinal commitment, but it had an early role in repressing development towards the hepatic lineage. When hindgut stage cells were further cultured in 3D, they formed self-renewing organoid structures containing all major intestinal cell types even without exogenous R-spondin1 (RSPO1), a crucial factor for the culture of epithelial organoids derived from adult intestine. This may be explained by the presence of a mesenchymal compartment in the hPSC-derived organoids. Addition of WNT3A increased the expression of the Paneth cell marker Lysozyme in hPSC-derived organoid cultures, whereas FGF4 inhibited both the formation and maturation of intestinal-like organoids. Similar hindgut and organoid cultures were established from human induced pluripotent stem cells, implying that this approach can be used to create patient-specific intestinal tissue models for disease modeling in vitro.	
32708005        	Chemosensitivity of Patient-Derived Cancer Stem Cells Identifies Colorectal Cancer Patients with Potential Benefit from FGFR Inhibitor Therapy.            	Some colorectal cancer patients harboring FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) genetic alterations, such as copy number gain, mutation, and/or mRNA overexpression, were selected for enrollment in several recent clinical trials of FGFR inhibitor, because these genetic alterations were preclinically reported to be associated with FGFR inhibitor sensitivity as well as poor prognosis, invasiveness, and/or metastatic potential. However, few enrolled patients were responsive to FGFR inhibitors. Thus, practical strategies are eagerly awaited that can stratify patients for the subset that potentially responds to FGFR inhibitor chemotherapy. In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity to FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib on 25 patient-derived tumor-initiating cell (TIC) spheroid lines carrying wild-type RAS and RAF genes, both in vitro and in vivo. Then, we assessed possible correlations between the sensitivity and the genetic/genomic data of the spheroid lines tested. Upon their exposure to erdafitinib, seven lines (7/25, 28%) responded significantly. Normal colonic epithelial stem cells were unaffected by the inhibitors. Moreover, the combination of erdafitinib with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib showed stronger growth inhibition than either drug alone, as efficacy was observed in 21 lines (84%) including 14 (56%) that were insensitive to erdafitinib alone. The in vitro erdafitinib response was accurately reflected on mouse xenografts of TIC spheroid lines. However, we found little correlation between their genetic/genomic alterations of TIC spheroids and the sensitivity to the FGFR inhibitor. Accordingly, we propose that direct testing of the patient-derived spheroids in vitro is one of the most reliable personalized methods in FGFR-inhibitor therapy of colorectal cancer patients.	
32753653        	Topical application of Chlorin e6-PVP (Ce6-PVP) for improved endoscopic detection of neoplastic lesions in a murine colitis-associated cancer model.            	Screening colonoscopy is crucial in reducing the mortality of colorectal cancer. However, detecting adenomas against the backdrop of an inflamed mucosa (e.g. in ulcerative colitis) remains exceedingly difficult. Therefore, we aimed to improve neoplastic lesion detection by employing a fluorescence-based endoscopic approach. We used the well-established murine AOM/DSS model to induce inflammation-driven carcinogenesis in the colon. In our diagnostic approach, we evaluated Chlorin e6 polyvinylpyrrolidone (Ce6-PVP)-based fluorescence endoscopy in comparison to standard white-light endoscopy. A specialized pathologist then analyzed the histology of the detected lesions. Complementary in vitro studies were performed using human cell lines and a murine organoid system. Ce6-PVP-based fluorescence endoscopy had an improved detection rate of 100% (8/8) in detecting high-grade dysplasias and carcinomas over white-light detection alone with 75% (6/8). Trade-off for this superior detection rate was an increased rate of false positive lesions with an increase in the false discovery rate from 45% for white-light endoscopy to 81% for fluorescence endoscopy. We demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study that Ce6-PVP-based fluorescence endoscopy is a highly sensitive red flag technology to identify biopsy-worthy lesions in the colon.	
32930708        	Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli Infection in Cancer and Immunosuppressed Patients.            	The role of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) as cause of diarrhea in cancer and immunocompromised patients is controversial. Quantitation of bacterial loads has been proposed as a method to differentiate colonized from truly infected patients.                We studied 77 adult cancer and immunosuppressed patients with diarrhea and EPEC identified in stools by FilmArray, 25 patients with pathogen-negative diarrhea and 21 healthy adults without diarrhea. Stools were studied by qRT-PCR for EPEC genes eaeA, and lifA/efa-1 and strains characterized for virulence factors and adherence to human intestinal enteroids (HIEs).                Patients with EPEC were more likely to have community acquired diarrhea (p=0.009 OR 3.82, [95% CI 1.5-10.0]) when compared to pathogen negative cases. Although EPEC was identified in 3 of 21 (14%) of healthy subjects by qRT-PCR, the bacterial burden was low when compared to patients with diarrhea (≤55 vs. 6x10 4 bacteria/mg stool, p<0.001). Among EPEC patients, the bacterial burden was higher in those receiving immunosuppression (median 6.7x10 3 vs. 55 bacteria/mg, p<0.001) and those with fecal lifA/efa1 (median 5x10 4 vs. 120 bacteria/mg, p=0.015). Response to antimicrobial therapy was seen in 44/48 (92%) of patients with EPEC as the sole pathogen. Antimicrobial resistance was common and strains exhibited distinct patterns of adherence with variable cytotoxicity when studied in HIEs. Cancer care was delayed in 13% of patients.                Immunosuppressed cancer patients with EPEC associated diarrhea carry high burden of EPEC with strains that are resistant to antibiotics, exhibit novel patterns of adherence when studied in HIEs, and interfere with cancer care.                © The Author(s) 2020.

33042963        	Multi-Cell Type Glioblastoma Tumor Spheroids for Evaluating Sub-Population-Specific Drug Response.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal, incurable form of cancer in the brain. Even with maximally aggressive surgery and chemoradiotherapy, median patient survival is 14.5 months. These tumors infiltrate normal brain tissue, are surgically incurable, and universally recur. GBMs are characterized by genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental heterogeneity, and they evolve spontaneously over time and as a result of treatment. However, tracking such heterogeneity in real time in response to drug treatments has been impossible. Here we describe the development of an in vitro GBM tumor organoid model that is comprised of five distinct cellular subpopulations (4 GBM cell lines that represent GBM subpopulations and 1 astrocyte line), each fluorescently labeled with a different color. These multi-cell type GBM organoids are then embedded in a brain-like hyaluronic acid hydrogel for subsequent studies involving drug treatments and tracking of changes in relative numbers of each fluorescently unique subpopulation. This approach allows for the visual assessment of drug influence on individual subpopulations within GBM, and in future work can be expanded to supporting studies using patient tumor biospecimen-derived cells for personalized diagnostics.

32059418        	Patient Derived Models to Study Head and Neck Cancer Radiation Response.            	Patient-derived model systems are important tools for studying novel anti-cancer therapies. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) have gained favor over the last 10 years as newer mouse strains have improved the success rate of establishing PDXs from patient biopsies. PDXs can be engrafted from head and neck cancer (HNC) samples across a wide range of cancer stages, retain the genetic features of their human source, and can be treated with both chemotherapy and radiation, allowing for clinically relevant studies. Not only do PDXs allow for the study of patient tissues in an in vivo model, they can also provide a renewable source of cancer cells for organoid cultures. Herein, we review the uses of HNC patient-derived models for radiation research, including approaches to establishing both orthotopic and heterotopic PDXs, approaches and potential pitfalls to delivering chemotherapy and radiation to these animal models, biological advantages and limitations, and alternatives to animal studies that still use patient-derived tissues.	
29291971        	Developmental mechanisms and adult stem cells for therapeutic lung regeneration.            	Chronic degenerative lung diseases are essentially untreatable pathological conditions. By contrast, the healthy lung has numerous mechanisms that allow for rapid repair and restoration of function following minor acute injuries. We discuss the normal endogenous processes of lung development, homeostatic maintenance and repair and consider the research strategies required for the development of methods for human therapeutic lung regeneration.

28823572        	A study of appendiceal crypt cell adenocarcinoma (so-called goblet cell carcinoid and its related adenocarcinoma).            	Goblet cell carcinoids (GCCs) of the appendix are rare tumors, characterized by a carcinoid-like organoid growth pattern. Despite the term carcinoid, neuroendocrine features are inconspicuous, and its behavior is distinct from carcinoid. Its high-grade counterpart is designated as adenocarcinoma ex GCC. We conducted a retrospective study of 105 tumors to find prognostic values of a variety of clinicopathologic features. The tumors were subclassified as low grade, equivalent to classic type, and high grade, defined as loss of organoid pattern, and a proportion (%) of low and high grades were documented in each tumor. Correlations between survival and various clinicopathologic parameters were investigated. One-third were pure low grade, while the remainder contained variable high-grade component ranging from 5% to 95%. Neuroendocrine cell component ranged from 0% to 90% (median, 5), while mucus cell component ranged from 5% to 100% (median, 70). By univariate analysis, size, stage, high-grade component, nuclear grade, surgery, and chemotherapy correlated with cancer-related survival (CSS), and by multivariate analysis, stage (P=.001), high-grade component (P=.008), and tumor size (P=.005) correlated with CSS. There was significant difference in CSS when the cases were grouped by high-grade component: <40%, 40% to 90%, and ≤90% (P<.001). Our results indicate that staging and proportion of high-grade histology may provide important prognostic information. Neuroendocrine component was insignificant in both low- and high-grade areas. In light of our findings, this tumor type is best regarded as a variant of adenocarcinoma, and the term crypt cell adenocarcinoma more appropriately reflects the nature and origin of this tumor group.

32456018        	Patient-Derived Xenograft Models of Pancreatic Cancer: Overview and Comparison with Other Types of Models.            	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is anticipated to be second only to lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States by 2030. Surgery remains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common form of PC. Multiple recent preclinical studies focus on identifying effective treatments for PDAC, but the models available for these studies often fail to reproduce the heterogeneity of this tumor type. Data generated with such models are of unknown clinical relevance. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models offer several advantages over human cell line-based in vitro and in vivo models and models of non-human origin. PDX models retain genetic characteristics of the human tumor specimens from which they were derived, have intact stromal components, and are more predictive of patient response than traditional models. This review briefly describes the advantages and disadvantages of 2D cultures, organoids and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of PDAC, and focuses on the applications, characteristics, advantages, limitations, and the future potential of PDX models for improving the management of PDAC.	
32423157        	Genetic Alterations Featuring Biological Models to Tailor Clinical Management of Pancreatic Cancer Patients.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. This high mortality rate is due to the disease's lack of symptoms, resulting in a late diagnosis. Biomarkers and treatment options for pancreatic cancer are also limited. In order to overcome this, new research models and novel approaches to discovering PDAC biomarkers are required. In this review, we outline the hereditary and somatic causes of PDAC and provide an overview of the recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) and pathway analysis studies. We also provide a summary of some of the systems used to study PDAC, including established and primary cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and newer models such as organoids and organ-on-chip. These ex vitro laboratory systems allow for critical research into the development and progression of PDAC.	
31237864        	RasGRP1 is a potential biomarker to stratify anti-EGFR therapy response in colorectal cancer.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent neoplastic disorder and is a main cause of tumor-related mortality as many patients progress to stage IV metastatic CRC. Standard care consists of combination chemotherapy (FOLFIRI or FOLFOX). Patients with WT KRAS typing are eligible to receive anti-EGFR therapy combined with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, predicting efficacy of CRC anti-EGFR therapy has remained challenging. Here we uncover that the EGFR-pathway component RasGRP1 acts as CRC tumor suppressor in the context of aberrant Wnt signaling. We find that RasGRP1 suppresses EGF-driven proliferation of colonic epithelial organoids. Having established that RasGRP1 dosage levels impacts biology, we focused on CRC patients next. Mining five different data platforms, we establish that RasGRP1 expression levels decrease with CRC progression and predict poor clinical outcome of patients. Lastly, deletion of one or two Rasgrp1 alleles makes CRC spheroids more susceptible to EGFR inhibition. Retrospective analysis of the CALGB80203 clinical trial shows that addition of anti-EGFR therapy to chemotherapy significantly improves outcome for CRC patients when tumors express low RasGRP1 suppressor levels. In sum, RasGRP1 is a unique biomarker positioned in the EGFR pathway and of potential relevance to anti-EGFR therapy for CRC patients.	
32944968        	Cholesterol 25-Hydroxylase inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses by depleting membrane cholesterol.            	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has spread across the globe. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus with no vaccine or antiviral therapy available to control the pandemic; therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and the host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the betacoronavirus genus like other closely related viruses including SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have caused serious outbreaks and epidemics in the past eighteen years. Here, we report that one of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), is induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in COVID-19-infected patients. CH25H converts cholesterol to 25-hydrocholesterol (25HC) and 25HC shows broad anti-coronavirus activity by blocking membrane fusion. Furthermore, 25HC inhibits USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells and viral entry in human lung organoids. Mechanistically, 25HC inhibits viral membrane fusion by activating the ER-localized acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) which leads to the depletion of accessible cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Altogether, our results shed light on a potentially broad antiviral mechanism by 25HC through depleting accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane to suppress virus-cell fusion. Since 25HC is a natural product with no known toxicity at effective concentrations, it provides a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases in the future.                © 2020 The Authors.

31097693        	MEK inhibitors activate Wnt signalling and induce stem cell plasticity in colorectal cancer.            	In colorectal cancer (CRC), aberrant Wnt signalling is essential for tumorigenesis and maintenance of cancer stem cells. However, how other oncogenic pathways converge on Wnt signalling to modulate stem cell homeostasis in CRC currently remains poorly understood. Using large-scale compound screens in CRC, we identify MEK1/2 inhibitors as potent activators of Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Targeting MEK increases Wnt activity in different CRC cell lines and murine intestine in vivo. Truncating mutations of APC generated by CRISPR/Cas9 strongly synergize with MEK inhibitors in enhancing Wnt responses in isogenic CRC models. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that MEK inhibition induces a rapid downregulation of AXIN1. Using patient-derived CRC organoids, we show that MEK inhibition leads to increased Wnt activity, elevated LGR5 levels and enrichment of gene signatures associated with stemness and cancer relapse. Our study demonstrates that clinically used MEK inhibitors inadvertently induce stem cell plasticity, revealing an unknown side effect of RAS pathway inhibition.	
32611550        	Inhibition of O-GlcNAc Transferase Renders Prostate Cancer Cells Dependent on CDK9.            	O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is a nutrient-sensitive glycosyltransferase that is overexpressed in prostate cancer, the most common cancer in males. We recently developed a specific and potent inhibitor targeting this enzyme, and here, we report a synthetic lethality screen using this compound. Our screen identified pan-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor AT7519 as lethal in combination with OGT inhibition. Follow-up chemical and genetic approaches identified CDK9 as the major target for synthetic lethality with OGT inhibition in prostate cancer cells. OGT expression is regulated through retention of the fourth intron in the gene and CDK9 inhibition blunted this regulatory mechanism. CDK9 phosphorylates carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II to promote transcription elongation. We show that OGT inhibition augments effects of CDK9 inhibitors on CTD phosphorylation and general transcription. Finally, the combined inhibition of both OGT and CDK9 blocked growth of organoids derived from patients with metastatic prostate cancer, but had minimal effects on normal prostate spheroids. We report a novel synthetic lethal interaction between inhibitors of OGT and CDK9 that specifically kills prostate cancer cells, but not normal cells. Our study highlights the potential of combining OGT inhibitors with other treatments to exploit cancer-specific vulnerabilities. IMPLICATIONS: The primary contribution of OGT to cell proliferation is unknown, and in this study, we used a compound screen to indicate that OGT and CDK9 collaborate to sustain a cancer cell-specific pro-proliferative program. A better understanding of how OGT and CDK9 cross-talk will refine our understanding of this novel synthetic lethal interaction.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
28529641        	Multifunctional Nucleus-targeting Nanoparticles with Ultra-high Gene Transfection Efficiency for In Vivo Gene Therapy.            	Cancer stem cell-like cells (CSCL) are responsible for tumor recurrence associated with conventional therapy (e.g. surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy). Here, we developed a novel multifunctional nucleus-targeting nanoparticle-based gene delivery system which is capable of targeting and eradicating CSCL. These nanoparticles can facilitate efficient endosomal escape and spontaneously penetrate into nucleus without additional nuclear localization signal. They also induced extremely high gene transfection efficiency (>95%) even in culture medium containing 30% serum, which significantly surpassed that of some commercial transfection reagents, such as Lipofectamine 2000 and Lipofectamine 3000 etc. Especially, when loaded with the TRAIL gene, this system mediated remarkable depletion of CSCL. Upon systemic administration, the nanoparticles accumulated in tumor sites while sparing the non-cancer tissues and significantly inhibited the growth of tumors with no evident systemic toxicity. Taken together, our results suggest that these novel multifunctional, nucleus-targeting nanoparticles are a very promising in vivo gene delivery system capable of targeting CSCL and represent a new treatment candidate for improving the survival of cancer patients.	
32226516        	A thioredoxin reductase inhibitor ethaselen induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in gastric cancer.            	Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Conventional chemotherapy has been proven useful to only a portion of the patients. Previous developed targeted drugs are more effective and tolerable than conventional drugs. Thus the development of novel drugs targeting markers is an urgent task and the main direction for future research. Ethaselen, an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), has been considered an important anticancer target drug. Previous studies show that it is effective on treating many kinds of cancers. In this paper, we examined that ethaselen effectively inhibited the growth of gastric cancer cells and promoted apoptosis. Organoids were cultured from patient-derived cells in a three-dimension form which are widely used in cancer research to help us understand cancer cells behavior at the sub-organ level and develop novel drugs. We established a drug testing and screening system using GC-derived organoids by recapitulating tumor microenvironment. We confirmed that the TrxR-targeting ethaselen could be a novel and effective drug for gastric cancer treatment.                © The author(s).	
33120992        	Ribosome Biogenesis Alterations in Colorectal Cancer.            	Many studies have focused on understanding the regulation and functions of aberrant protein synthesis in colorectal cancer (CRC), leaving the ribosome, its main effector, relatively underappreciated in CRC. The production of functional ribosomes is initiated in the nucleolus, requires coordinated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing and ribosomal protein (RP) assembly, and is frequently hyperactivated to support the needs in protein synthesis essential to withstand unremitting cancer cell growth. This elevated ribosome production in cancer cells includes a strong alteration of ribosome biogenesis homeostasis that represents one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. None of the ribosome production steps escape this cancer-specific dysregulation. This review summarizes the early and late steps of ribosome biogenesis dysregulations described in CRC cell lines, intestinal organoids, CRC stem cells and mouse models, and their possible clinical implications. We highlight how this cancer-related ribosome biogenesis, both at quantitative and qualitative levels, can lead to the synthesis of ribosomes favoring the translation of mRNAs encoding hyperproliferative and survival factors. We also discuss whether cancer-related ribosome biogenesis is a mere consequence of cancer progression or is a causal factor in CRC, and how altered ribosome biogenesis pathways can represent effective targets to kill CRC cells. The association between exacerbated CRC cell growth and alteration of specific steps of ribosome biogenesis is highlighted as a key driver of tumorigenesis, providing promising perspectives for the implementation of predictive biomarkers and the development of new therapeutic drugs.	
28947138        	Speeding towards individualized treatment for pancreatic cancer by taking an alternative road.            	Accumulation of genetic mutations drives the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Contrary to what it is expected, however, genetic analyses, no matter how precise or detailed, do not allow the identification of patient groups with different clinical outcomes or the selection of specific treatments. In fact, clinical outcome and sensitivity to treatments are associated with a given phenotype and are therefore associated at a transcriptomic level. In practical terms, therefore, the most appropriate readout for phenotypically stratifying PDACs should be transcriptomic and not genetic analysis. Recently data indicate that studying the expression of a selected gene set could inform selection of the most appropriate treatment for patients, moving towards an individualized medicine approach for this dismal disease. We are optimizing this approach by developing a platform based on obtaining organoids directly from surgical as well as endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsies of tumors, which serve as a source of RNA, allowing determination of the transcription level of some informative genes. We are convinced that in the near future, the treatment of cancers will be preceded by an extensive molecular characterization of cancer cells in order to select the most appropriate treatments.

25677229        	Tissue-engineered urinary conduits.            	The role of tissue engineering in the cystectomy population rests on the principle of sparing healthy intestinal tissue while replacing diseased bladder. Over the last 25 years advances in cell biology and material science have improved the quality and durability of bladder replacement in animals. The neo-urinary conduit ([NUC]-Tengion) employs autologous fat smooth muscle cells which are seeded onto synthetic, biodegradable scaffolds. This seeded construct is then implanted in the patient and purportedly regenerates native urinary tissue to serve as a passive channel connecting the ureters to the skin surface. Preclinical animal studies as well as the first phase I human trial implanting the NUC are reviewed. While the ultimate goal of creating a durable, effective, tissue-engineered conduit is still in its infancy, important technical and experimental strides have been made.	
31395740        	Max deletion destabilizes MYC protein and abrogates Eµ-Myc lymphomagenesis.            	Although MAX is regarded as an obligate dimerization partner for MYC, its function in normal development and neoplasia is poorly defined. We show that B-cell-specific deletion of Max has a modest effect on B-cell development but completely abrogates Eµ-Myc-driven lymphomagenesis. While Max loss affects only a few hundred genes in normal B cells, it leads to the global down-regulation of Myc-activated genes in premalignant Eµ-Myc cells. We show that the balance between MYC-MAX and MNT-MAX interactions in B cells shifts in premalignant B cells toward a MYC-driven transcriptional program. Moreover, we found that MAX loss leads to a significant reduction in MYC protein levels and down-regulation of direct transcriptional targets, including regulators of MYC stability. This phenomenon is also observed in multiple cell lines treated with MYC-MAX dimerization inhibitors. Our work uncovers a layer of Myc autoregulation critical for lymphomagenesis yet partly dispensable for normal development.                © 2019 Mathsyaraja et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
30332648        	PRMT6 Regulates RAS/RAF Binding and MEK/ERK-Mediated Cancer Stemness Activities in Hepatocellular Carcinoma through CRAF Methylation.            	Arginine methylation is a post-translational modification that plays pivotal roles in signal transduction and gene transcription during cell fate determination. We found protein methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) to be frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its expression to negatively correlate with aggressive cancer features in HCC patients. Silencing of PRMT6 promoted the tumor-initiating, metastasis, and therapy resistance potential of HCC cell lines and patient-derived organoids. Consistently, loss of PRMT6 expression aggravated liver tumorigenesis in a chemical-induced HCC PRMT6 knockout (PRMT6-/-) mouse model. Integrated transcriptome and protein-protein interaction studies revealed an enrichment of genes implicated in RAS signaling and showed that PRMT6 interacted with CRAF on arginine 100, which decreased its RAS binding potential and altered its downstream MEK/ERK signaling. Our work describes a critical repressive function for PRMT6 in maintenance of HCC cells by regulating RAS binding and MEK/ERK signaling via methylation of CRAF on arginine 100.

32376773        	Somatic Tissue Engineering in Mouse Models Reveals an Actionable Role for WNT Pathway Alterations in Prostate Cancer Metastasis.            	To study genetic factors influencing the progression and therapeutic responses of advanced prostate cancer, we developed a fast and flexible system that introduces genetic alterations relevant to human disease directly into the prostate glands of mice using tissue electroporation. These electroporation-based genetically engineered mouse models (EPO-GEMM) recapitulate features of traditional germline models and, by modeling genetic factors linked to late-stage human disease, can produce tumors that are metastatic and castration-resistant. A subset of tumors with Trp53 alterations acquired spontaneous WNT pathway alterations, which are also associated with metastatic prostate cancer in humans. Using the EPO-GEMM approach and an orthogonal organoid-based model, we show that WNT pathway activation drives metastatic disease that is sensitive to pharmacologic WNT pathway inhibition. Thus, by leveraging EPO-GEMMs, we reveal a functional role for WNT signaling in driving prostate cancer metastasis and validate the WNT pathway as therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Our understanding of the factors driving metastatic prostate cancer is limited by the paucity of models of late-stage disease. Here, we develop EPO-GEMMs of prostate cancer and use them to identify and validate the WNT pathway as an actionable driver of aggressive metastatic disease.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 890.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31281387        	MEK Inhibition Targets Cancer Stem Cells and Impedes Migration of Pancreatic Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a devastating disease with a very poor prognosis. At the same time, its incidence is on the rise, and PDAC is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Despite extensive work on new therapeutic approaches, the median overall survival is only 6-12 months after diagnosis and the 5-year survival is less than 7%. While pancreatic cancer is particularly difficult to treat, patients usually succumb not to the growth of the primary tumor, but to extensive metastasis; therefore, strategies to reduce the migratory and metastatic capacity of pancreatic cancer cells merit close attention. The vast majority of pancreatic cancers harbor RAS mutations. The outstanding relevance of the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway in pancreatic cancer biology has been extensively shown previously. Due to their high dependency on Ras mutations, pancreatic cancers might be particularly sensitive to inhibitors acting downstream of Ras. Herein, we use a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer and primary pancreatic cancer cells were derived from this model to demonstrate that small-molecule MEK inhibitors functionally abrogate cancer stem cell populations as demonstrated by reduced sphere and organoid formation capacity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MEK inhibition suppresses TGFβ-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and migration in vitro and ultimately results in a highly significant reduction in circulating tumor cells in mice.	
29144463        	A single-cell survey of the small intestinal epithelium.            	Intestinal epithelial cells absorb nutrients, respond to microbes, function as a barrier and help to coordinate immune responses. Here we report profiling of 53,193 individual epithelial cells from the small intestine and organoids of mice, which enabled the identification and characterization of previously unknown subtypes of intestinal epithelial cell and their gene signatures. We found unexpected diversity in hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells and constructed the taxonomy of newly identified subtypes, and distinguished between two subtypes of tuft cell, one of which expresses the epithelial cytokine Tslp and the pan-immune marker CD45, which was not previously associated with non-haematopoietic cells. We also characterized the ways in which cell-intrinsic states and the proportions of different cell types respond to bacterial and helminth infections: Salmonella infection caused an increase in the abundance of Paneth cells and enterocytes, and broad activation of an antimicrobial program; Heligmosomoides polygyrus caused an increase in the abundance of goblet and tuft cells. Our survey highlights previously unidentified markers and programs, associates sensory molecules with cell types, and uncovers principles of gut homeostasis and response to pathogens.	
31992154        	Design and Fabrication of Three-Dimensional Printed Scaffolds for Cancer Precision Medicine.            	Three-dimensional (3D)-engineered scaffolds have been widely investigated as drug delivery systems (DDS) or cancer models with the aim to develop effective cancer therapies. The in vitro and in vivo models developed via 3D printing (3DP) and tissue engineering concepts have significantly contributed to our understanding of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions in the cancer microenvironment. Moreover, 3D tumor models were used to study the therapeutic efficiency of anticancer drugs. The present study aims to provide an overview of applying the 3DP and tissue engineering concepts for cancer studies with suggestions for future research directions. The 3DP technologies being used for the fabrication of personalized DDS have been highlighted and the potential technical approaches and challenges associated with the fused deposition modeling, the inkjet-powder bed, and stereolithography as the most promising 3DP techniques for drug delivery purposes are briefly described. Then, the advances, challenges, and future perspectives in tissue-engineered cancer models for precision medicine are discussed. Overall, future advances in this arena depend on the continuous integration of knowledge from cancer biology, biofabrication techniques, multiomics and patient data, and medical needs to develop effective treatments ultimately leading to improved clinical outcomes. Impact statement Three-dimensional printing (3DP) enables the fabrication of personalized medicines and drug delivery systems. The convergence of 3DP, tissue engineering concepts, and cancer biology could significantly improve our understanding of cancer biology and contribute to the development of new cancer therapies.	
24559448        	Tumor heterogeneity and personalized cancer medicine: are we being outnumbered?            	Tumor heterogeneity is regarded as a major obstacle to successful personalized cancer medicine. The lack of reliable response assays reflective of in vivo tumor heterogeneity and associated resistance mechanisms hampers identification of reliable biomarkers. By contrast, oncogene addiction and paracrine signaling enable systemic responses despite tumor heterogeneity. This strengthens researchers in their efforts towards personalized cancer medicine. Given the fact that tumor heterogeneity is an integral part of cancer evolution, diagnostic tools need to be developed in order to better understand the dynamics within a tumor. Ultra-deep sequencing may reveal future resistant clones within a (liquid) tumor biopsy. On-treatment biopsies may provide insight into intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Subsequently, upfront combinatorial treatment or sequential therapy strategies may forestall drug resistance and improve patient outcome. Finally, innovative response assays, such as organoid cultures or patient-derived tumor xenografts, provide an extra dimension to correlate molecular profiles with drug efficacy and control cancer growth.	
32457900        	An FGFR/AKT/SOX2 Signaling Axis Controls Pancreatic Cancer Stemness.            	Cancer stemness is associated with high malignancy and low differentiation, as well as therapeutic resistance of tumors including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) exert pleiotropic effects on a variety of cellular processes and functions including embryonic stem cell pluripotency and cancer cell stemness via the activation of four tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs). FGF ligands have been a major component of the cocktail of growth factors contained in the cancer stemness-inducing (CSI) and organoid culture medium. Although FGF/FGFR signaling has been hypothesized to maintain cancer stemness, its function in this process is still unclear. We report that inhibition of FGF/FGFR signaling impairs sphere-forming ability of PDAC in vitro, and knocking down FGFR1 and FGFR2 decreased their tumorigenesis abilities in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that SOX2 is down-regulated upon loss of FGFR signaling. The overexpression of SOX2 in SOX2-negative cells, which normally do not display stemness capabilities, is sufficient to induce spheroid formation. Additionally, we found that AKT phosphorylation was reduced upon FGFR signaling inhibition. The inhibition of AKT using specific pharmacological inhibitors in the context of CSI medium leads to the loss of spheroid formation associated with loss of SOX2 nuclear expression and increased degradation. We demonstrate that an FGFR/AKT/SOX2 axis controls cancer stemness in PDAC and therefore may represent an important therapeutic target in the fight against this very aggressive form of cancer.

32218280        	Hippo-YAP1 Is a Prognosis Marker and Potentially Targetable Pathway in Advanced Gallbladder Cancer.            	Gallbladder cancer is an aggressive disease with late diagnosis and no efficacious treatment. The Hippo-Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) signaling pathway has emerged as a target for the development of new therapeutic interventions in cancers. However, the role of the Hippo-targeted therapy has not been addressed in advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC). This study aimed to evaluate the expression of the major Hippo pathway components mammalian Ste20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1), YAP1 and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and examined the effects of Verteporfin (VP), a small molecular inhibitor of YAP1-TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD) protein interaction, in metastatic GBC cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that advanced GBC patients had high nuclear expression of YAP1. High nuclear expression of YAP1 was associated with poor survival in GBC patients with subserosal invasion (pT2). Additionally, advanced GBC cases showed reduced expression of MST1 compared to chronic cholecystitis. Both VP treatment and YAP1 siRNA inhibited the migration ability in GBC cell lines. Interestingly, gemcitabine resistant PDOs with high nuclear expression of YAP1 were sensitive to VP treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that key components of the Hippo-YAP1 signaling pathway are dysregulated in advanced gallbladder cancer and reveal that the inhibition YAP1 may be a candidate for targeted therapy.	
32661339        	Persistence of a regeneration-associated, transitional alveolar epithelial cell state in pulmonary fibrosis.            	Stem cells undergo dynamic changes in response to injury to regenerate lost cells. However, the identity of transitional states and the mechanisms that drive their trajectories remain understudied. Using lung organoids, multiple in vivo repair models, single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we find that alveolar type-2 epithelial cells undergoing differentiation into type-1 cells acquire pre-alveolar type-1 transitional cell state (PATS) en route to terminal maturation. Transitional cells undergo extensive stretching during differentiation, making them vulnerable to DNA damage. Cells in the PATS show an enrichment of TP53, TGFβ, DNA-damage-response signalling and cellular senescence. Gain and loss of function as well as genomic binding assays revealed a direct transcriptional control of PATS by TP53 signalling. Notably, accumulation of PATS-like cells in human fibrotic lungs was observed, suggesting persistence of the transitional state in fibrosis. Our study thus implicates a transient state associated with senescence in normal epithelial tissue repair and its abnormal persistence in disease conditions.	
30902924        	Glioblastoma heterogeneity and the tumour microenvironment: implications for preclinical research and development of new treatments.            	Glioblastoma is the deadliest form of brain cancer. Aside from inadequate treatment options, one of the main reasons glioblastoma is so lethal is the rapid growth of tumour cells coupled with continuous cell invasion into surrounding healthy brain tissue. Significant intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity associated with differences in the corresponding tumour microenvironments contributes greatly to glioblastoma progression. Within this tumour microenvironment, the extracellular matrix profoundly influences the way cancer cells become invasive, and changes to extracellular (pH and oxygen levels) and metabolic (glucose and lactate) components support glioblastoma growth. Furthermore, studies on clinical samples have revealed that the tumour microenvironment is highly immunosuppressive which contributes to failure in immunotherapy treatments. Although technically possible, many components of the tumour microenvironment have not yet been the focus of glioblastoma therapies, despite growing evidence of its importance to glioblastoma malignancy. Here, we review recent progress in the characterisation of the glioblastoma tumour microenvironment and the sources of tumour heterogeneity in human clinical material. We also discuss the latest advances in technologies for personalised and in vitro preclinical studies using brain organoid models to better model glioblastoma and its interactions with the surrounding healthy brain tissue, which may play an essential role in developing new and more personalised treatments for this aggressive type of cancer.                © 2019 The Author(s).

29909492        	Modelling glioma invasion using 3D bioprinting and scaffold-free 3D culture.            	Glioma is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer, with some subtypes having 5-year survival rates of less than 5%. Tumour cell invasion into the surrounding parenchyma seems to be the primary driver of these poor outcomes, as most gliomas recur within 2 cm of the original surgically-resected tumour. Many current approaches to the development of anticancer therapy attempt to target genetic weaknesses in a particular cancer, but may not take into account the microenvironment experienced by a tumour and the patient-specific genetic differences in susceptibility to treatment. Here we demonstrate the use of complementary approaches, 3D bioprinting and scaffold-free 3D tissue culture, to examine the invasion of glioma cells into neural-like tissue with 3D confocal microscopy. We found that, while both approaches were successful, the use of 3D tissue culture for organoid development offers the advantage of broad accessibility. As a proof-of-concept of our approach, we developed a system in which we could model the invasion of human glioma cells into mouse neural progenitor cell-derived spheroids. We show that we can follow invasion of human tumour cells using cell-tracking dyes and 3D laser scanning confocal microscopy, both in real time and in fixed samples. We validated these results using conventional cryosectioning. Our scaffold-free 3D approach has broad applicability, as we were easily able to examine invasion using different neural progenitor cell lines, thus mimicking differences that might be observed in patient brain tissue. These results, once applied to iPSC-derived cerebral organoids that incorporate the somatic genetic variability of patients, offer the promise of truly personalized treatments for brain cancer.	
31286138        	The Role of APAL/ST8SIA6-AS1 lncRNA in PLK1 Activation and Mitotic Catastrophe of Tumor Cells.            	Tumor growth can be addicted to vital oncogenes, but whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are essential to cancer survival is largely uncharacterized.                We retrieved Gene Expression Omnibus datasets to identify lncRNA overexpression in 257 cancers vs 196 normal tissues and analyzed the association of ST8SIA6-AS1 (termed Aurora A/Polo-like-kinase 1 [PLK1]-associated lncRNA, APAL) with the clinical outcomes of multiple types of cancer from public RNA sequencing and microarray datasets as well as from in-house cancer cohorts. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments were performed to explore the role of APAL in cancers in vitro and in vivo. RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to investigate APAL-interacting proteins. All statistical tests were two-sided.                APAL is overexpressed in multiple human cancers associated with poor clinical outcome of patients. APAL knockdown causes mitotic catastrophe and massive apoptosis in human breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer cells. Overexpressing APAL accelerates cancer cell cycle progression, promotes proliferation, and inhibits chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Mechanism studies show that APAL links up PLK1 and Aurora A to enhance Aurora A-mediated PLK1 phosphorylation. Notably, targeting APAL inhibits the growth of breast and lung cancer xenografts in vivo (MCF-7 xenografts: mean tumor weight, control = 0.18 g [SD = 0.03] vs APAL locked nucleic acids = 0.07 g [SD = 0.02], P < .001, n = 8 mice per group; A549 xenografts: mean tumor weight control = 0.36 g [SD = 0.10] vs APAL locked nucleic acids = 0.10 g [SD = 0.04], P < .001, n = 9 mice per group) and the survival of patient-derived breast cancer organoids in three-dimensional cultures.                Our data highlight the essential role of lncRNA in cancer cell survival and the potential of APAL as an attractive therapeutic target for a broad-spectrum of cancers.                © The Author(s) 2019.

32430388        	EGFR Blockade Reverts Resistance to KRASG12C Inhibition in Colorectal Cancer.            	Most patients with KRASG12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) experience clinical benefit from selective KRASG12C inhibition, whereas patients with colorectal cancer bearing the same mutation rarely respond. To investigate the cause of the limited efficacy of KRASG12C inhibitors in colorectal cancer, we examined the effects of AMG510 in KRASG12C colorectal cancer cell lines. Unlike NSCLC cell lines, KRASG12C colorectal cancer models have high basal receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation and are responsive to growth factor stimulation. In colorectal cancer lines, KRASG12C inhibition induces higher phospho-ERK rebound than in NSCLC cells. Although upstream activation of several RTKs interferes with KRASG12C blockade, we identify EGFR signaling as the dominant mechanism of colorectal cancer resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors. The combinatorial targeting of EGFR and KRASG12C is highly effective in colorectal cancer cells and patient-derived organoids and xenografts, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy to treat patients with KRASG12C colorectal cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: The efficacy of KRASG12C inhibitors in NSCLC and colorectal cancer is lineage-specific. RTK dependency and signaling rebound kinetics are responsible for sensitivity or resistance to KRASG12C inhibition in colorectal cancer. EGFR and KRASG12C should be concomitantly inhibited to overcome resistance to KRASG12C blockade in colorectal tumors.See related commentary by Koleilat and Kwong, p. 1094.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1079.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32415208        	Targeting lysyl oxidase (LOX) overcomes chemotherapy resistance in triple negative breast cancer.            	Chemoresistance is a major obstacle in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. Here we identify hypoxia-induced ECM re-modeler, lysyl oxidase (LOX) as a key inducer of chemoresistance by developing chemoresistant TNBC tumors in vivo and characterizing their transcriptomes by RNA-sequencing. Inhibiting LOX reduces collagen cross-linking and fibronectin assembly, increases drug penetration, and downregulates ITGA5/FN1 expression, resulting in inhibition of FAK/Src signaling, induction of apoptosis and re-sensitization to chemotherapy. Similarly, inhibiting FAK/Src results in chemosensitization. These effects are observed in 3D-cultured cell lines, tumor organoids, chemoresistant xenografts, syngeneic tumors and PDX models. Re-expressing the hypoxia-repressed miR-142-3p, which targets HIF1A, LOX and ITGA5, causes further suppression of the HIF-1α/LOX/ITGA5/FN1 axis. Notably, higher LOX, ITGA5, or FN1, or lower miR-142-3p levels are associated with shorter survival in chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients. These results provide strong pre-clinical rationale for developing and testing LOX inhibitors to overcome chemoresistance in TNBC patients.	
32848220        	Heterotypic cell-cell communication regulates glandular stem cell multipotency.            	Glandular epithelia, including the mammary and prostate glands, are composed of basal cells (BCs) and luminal cells (LCs)1,2. Many glandular epithelia develop from multipotent basal stem cells (BSCs) that are replaced in adult life by distinct pools of unipotent stem cells1,3-8. However, adult unipotent BSCs can reactivate multipotency under regenerative conditions and upon oncogene expression3,9-13. This suggests that an active mechanism restricts BSC multipotency under normal physiological conditions, although the nature of this mechanism is unknown. Here we show that the ablation of LCs reactivates the multipotency of BSCs from multiple epithelia both in vivo in mice and in vitro in organoids. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that, after LC ablation, BSCs activate a hybrid basal and luminal cell differentiation program before giving rise to LCs-reminiscent of the genetic program that regulates multipotency during embryonic development7. By predicting ligand-receptor pairs from single-cell data14, we find that TNF-which is secreted by LCs-restricts BC multipotency under normal physiological conditions. By contrast, the Notch, Wnt and EGFR pathways were activated in BSCs and their progeny after LC ablation; blocking these pathways, or stimulating the TNF pathway, inhibited regeneration-induced BC multipotency. Our study demonstrates that heterotypic communication between LCs and BCs is essential to maintain lineage fidelity in glandular epithelial stem cells.	
33427396        	Semi-interpenetrating polymer network cryogels based on poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate and collagen as potential off-the-shelf platforms for cancer cell research.            	In the present work, we investigated the potential of novel semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) cryogels, obtained through ultraviolet exposure of aqueous mixtures of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate and type I collagen, as tunable off-the-shelf platforms for 3D cancer cell research. We synthesized semi-IPN cryogels with variable collagen amounts (0.1% and 1% w/v) and assessed the effect of collagen on key cryogel properties for cell culture, for example, porosity, degradation rate and mechanical stiffness. Then, we investigated the ability of the cryogels to sustain the long-term growth of two pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell populations, the parenchymal Panc1 cells and their derived cancer stem cells. Results revealed that both cell lines efficiently infiltrated, attached and expanded in the cryogels over a period of 14 days. However, only when grown in the cryogels with the highest collagen concentration, both cell lines reproduced their characteristic growth pattern previously observed in collagen-enriched organotypic cultures, biomimetic of the highly fibrotic PDAC stroma. Cellular preembedding in Matrigel, that is, the classical approach to develop/grow organoids, interfered with an efficient intra-scaffold migration and growth. Although preliminary, these findings highlight the potential of the proposed cryogels as reproducible and tunable cancer cell research platforms.                © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	
33489823        	Future perspectives from lung cancer pre-clinical models: new treatments are coming?            	Lung cancer currently stands out as both the most common and the most lethal type of cancer, the latter feature being partly explained by the fact that the majority of lung cancer patients already display advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. In recent years, the development of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for the therapeutic benefit of patients harboring certain molecular aberrations and the introduction of prospective molecular profiling in the clinical practice have revolutionized the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the identification of the best strategies to enhance treatment effectiveness and to avoid the critical phenomenon of drug tolerance and acquired resistance in patients with lung cancer still remains an unmet medical need. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are two complementary approaches to define tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution in a non-invasive manner and to perform functional studies on metastatic cells. Finally, the recent discovery that the tumor microenvironment architecture can be faithfully recapitulated in vitro represents a novel pre-clinical frontier with the potential to optimize more effective immunology-based precision therapies that could rapidly move forward to the clinic.                2020 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

31992541        	Single-Cell Proteomic Profiling Identifies Combined AXL and JAK1 Inhibition as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy for Lung Cancer.            	Cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) simultaneously measures multiple cellular proteins at the single-cell level and is used to assess intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity. This approach may be used to investigate the variability of individual tumor responses to treatments. Herein, we stratified lung tumor subpopulations based on AXL signaling as a potential targeting strategy. Integrative transcriptome analyses were used to investigate how TP-0903, an AXL kinase inhibitor, influences redundant oncogenic pathways in metastatic lung cancer cells. CyTOF profiling revealed that AXL inhibition suppressed SMAD4/TGFβ signaling and induced JAK1-STAT3 signaling to compensate for the loss of AXL. Interestingly, high JAK1-STAT3 was associated with increased levels of AXL in treatment-naïve tumors. Tumors with high AXL, TGFβ, and JAK1 signaling concomitantly displayed CD133-mediated cancer stemness and hybrid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition features in advanced-stage patients, suggesting greater potential for distant dissemination. Diffusion pseudotime analysis revealed cell-fate trajectories among four different categories that were linked to clinicopathologic features for each patient. Patient-derived organoids (PDO) obtained from tumors with high AXL and JAK1 were sensitive to TP-0903 and ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor) treatments, supporting the CyTOF findings. This study shows that single-cell proteomic profiling of treatment-naïve lung tumors, coupled with ex vivo testing of PDOs, identifies continuous AXL, TGFβ, and JAK1-STAT3 signal activation in select tumors that may be targeted by combined AXL-JAK1 inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: Single-cell proteomic profiling of clinical samples may facilitate the optimal selection of novel drug targets, interpretation of early-phase clinical trial data, and development of predictive biomarkers valuable for patient stratification.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32183503        	Emerging Role of Circulating Tumor Cells in Gastric Cancer.            	With over 1 million incidence cases and more than 780,000 deaths in 2018, gastric cancer (GC) was ranked as the 5th most common cancer and the 3rd leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Though several biomarkers, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and cancer antigen 72-4 (CA72-4), have been identified, their diagnostic accuracies were modest. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cells derived from tumors and present in body fluids, have recently emerged as promising biomarkers, diagnostically and prognostically, of cancers, including GC. In this review, we present the landscape of CTCs from migration, to the presence in circulation, biologic properties, and morphologic heterogeneities. We evaluated clinical implications of CTCs in GC patients, including diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic management, as well as their application in immunotherapy. On the one hand, major challenges in using CTCs in GC were analyzed, from the differences of cut-off values of CTC positivity, to techniques used for sampling, storage conditions, and CTC molecular markers, as well as the unavailability of relevant enrichment and detection techniques. On the other hand, we discussed future perspectives of using CTCs in GC management and research, including the use of circulating tumor microembolies; of CTC checkpoint blockade in immunotherapy; and of organoid models. Despite the fact that there are remaining challenges in techniques, CTCs have potential as novel biomarkers and/or a non-invasive method for diagnostics, prognostics, and treatment monitoring of GC, particularly in the era of precision medicine.	
32854355        	Vitamin D Effects on Cell Differentiation and Stemness in Cancer.            	Vitamin D3 is the precursor of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), a pleiotropic hormone that is a major regulator of the human genome. 1,25(OH)2D3 modulates the phenotype and physiology of many cell types by controlling the expression of hundreds of genes in a tissue- and cell-specific fashion. Vitamin D deficiency is common among cancer patients and numerous studies have reported that 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes the differentiation of a wide panel of cultured carcinoma cells, frequently associated with a reduction in cell proliferation and survival. A major mechanism of this action is inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which in turn is largely based on antagonism of the Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β and EGF signaling pathways. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 controls the gene expression profile and phenotype of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are important players in the tumorigenic process. Moreover, recent data suggest a regulatory role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the biology of normal and cancer stem cells (CSCs). Here, we revise the current knowledge of the molecular and genetic basis of the regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3 of the differentiation and stemness of human carcinoma cells, CAFs and CSCs. These effects support a homeostatic non-cytotoxic anticancer action of 1,25(OH)2D3 based on reprogramming of the phenotype of several cell types.	
32352658        	The effects of microgravity on differentiation and cell growth in stem cells and cancer stem cells.            	A spaceflight has enormous influence on the health of space voyagers due to the combined effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation. Known effects of microgravity (μg) on cells are changes in differentiation and growth. Considering the commercialization of spaceflight, future space exploration, and long-term manned flights, research focusing on differentiation and growth of stem cells and cancer cells exposed to real (r-) and simulated (s-) μg is of high interest for regenerative medicine and cancer research. In this review, we focus on platforms to study r- and s-μg as well as the impact of μg on cancer stem cells in the field of gastrointestinal cancer, lung cancer, and osteosarcoma. Moreover, we review the current knowledge of different types of stem cells exposed to μg conditions with regard to differentiation and engineering of cartilage, bone, vasculature, heart, skin, and liver constructs.                © 2020 The Authors.

32297829        	A Perspective on Expanding Our Understanding of Cancer Treatments by Integrating Approaches from the Biological and Physical Sciences.            	Multicellular systems such as cancer suffer from immense complexity. It is imperative to capture the heterogeneity of these systems across scales to achieve a deeper understanding of the underlying biology and develop effective treatment strategies. In this perspective article, we will discuss how recent technologies and approaches from the biological and physical sciences have transformed traditional ways of measuring, interpreting, and treating cancer. During the SLAS 2019 Annual Meeting, SBI2 hosted a Special Interest Group (SIG) on this topic. Academic and industry leaders engaged in discussions surrounding what biological model systems are appropriate to study cancer complexity, what assays are necessary to interrogate this complexity, and how physical sciences approaches may be useful to detangle this complexity. In particular, we examined the utility of mathematical models in predicting cancer progression and treatment response when tightly integrated with reproducible, quantitative, and dynamic biological measurements achieved using high-content imaging and analysis. The dialogue centered around the impetus for convergent biosciences, bringing new perspectives to cancer research to further understand this complex adaptive system and successfully intervene therapeutically.	
31676574        	Twist1-Induced Epithelial Dissemination Requires Prkd1 Signaling.            	Dissemination is an essential early step in metastasis but its molecular basis remains incompletely understood. To define the essential targetable effectors of this process, we developed a 3D mammary epithelial culture model, in which dissemination is induced by overexpression of the transcription factor Twist1. Transcriptomic analysis and ChIP-PCR together demonstrated that protein kinase D1 (Prkd1) is a direct transcriptional target of Twist1 and is not expressed in the normal mammary epithelium. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of Prkd1 in the Twist1-induced dissemination model demonstrated that Prkd1 was required for cells to initiate extracellular matrix (ECM)-directed protrusions, release from the epithelium, and migrate through the ECM. Antibody-based protein profiling revealed that Prkd1 induced broad phosphorylation changes, including an inactivating phosphorylation of β-catenin and two microtubule depolymerizing phosphorylations of Tau, potentially explaining the release of cell-cell contacts and persistent activation of Prkd1. In patients with breast cancer, TWIST1 and PRKD1 expression correlated with metastatic recurrence, particularly in basal breast cancer. Prkd1 knockdown was sufficient to block dissemination of both murine and human mammary tumor organoids. Finally, Prkd1 knockdown in vivo blocked primary tumor invasion and distant metastasis in a mouse model of basal breast cancer. Collectively, these data identify Prkd1 as a novel and targetable signaling node downstream of Twist1 that is required for epithelial invasion and dissemination. SIGNIFICANCE: Twist1 is a known regulator of metastatic cell behaviors but not directly targetable. This study provides a molecular explanation for how Twist1-induced dissemination works and demonstrates that it can be targeted.

31954489        	Novel patient-derived preclinical models of liver cancer.            	Preclinical models of cancer based on the use of human cancer cell lines and mouse models have enabled discoveries that have been successfully translated into patients. And yet the majority of clinical trials fail, emphasising the urgent need to improve preclinical research to better interrogate the potential efficacy of each therapy and the patient population most likely to benefit. This is particularly important for liver malignancies, which lack highly efficient treatments and account for hundreds of thousands of deaths around the globe. Given the intricate network of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to liver cancer development and progression, the identification of new druggable targets will mainly depend on establishing preclinical models that mirror the complexity of features observed in patients. The development of new 3D cell culture systems, originating from cells/tissues isolated from patients, might create new opportunities for the generation of more specific and personalised therapies. However, these systems are unable to recapitulate the tumour microenvironment and interactions with the immune system, both proven to be critical influences on therapeutic outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts, in particular with humanised mouse models, more faithfully mimic the physiology of human liver cancer but are costly and time-consuming, which can be prohibitive for personalising therapies in the setting of an aggressive malignancy. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in the development of more accurate preclinical models to better understand liver cancer biology and identify paradigm-changing therapies, stressing the importance of a bi-directional communicative flow between clinicians and researchers to establish reliable model systems and determine how best to apply them to expanding our current knowledge.

33348616        	Lung Adenocarcinoma Mouse Models Based on Orthotopic Transplantation of Syngeneic Tumor-Initiating Cells Expressing EpCAM, SCA-1, and Ly6d.            	Somatic mutations in EGFR and KRAS as well as chromosome rearrangements affecting ALK, ROS1, and RET have been identified in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We here developed organoid-based orthotopic and syngeneic mouse models for studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of LUAD. We isolated EpCAM-positive epithelial cells from mouse lungs and cultured them as organoids to maintain epithelial stem cell properties. These cells were transformed by KRAS(G12V) or EML4-ALK and then transplanted via the trachea into the lungs of the syngeneic mice, where they formed tumors that expressed the lung lineage marker TTF-1 and which closely recapitulated the pathology of human LUAD. Treatment with crizotinib suppressed the growth of tumors formed by the EML4-ALK-expressing lung epithelial cells in a subcutaneous transplantation model. Organoid culture of normal lung epithelial cells resulted in enrichment of EpCAM+SCA-1(Ly6a)+ cells as well as in that of cells expressing another member of the Ly6 protein family, Ly6d, which was found to be required for the growth of the LUAD-initiating cells expressing KRAS(G12V) or EML4-ALK. We also found that a high expression level of LY6D was associated with poor prognosis in human LUAD. Our results thus suggest that LY6D is a potential lung cancer stem cell marker.	
32590255        	Slug-expressing mouse prostate epithelial cells have increased stem cell potential.            	Deciphering the properties of adult stem cells is crucial for understanding of their role in healthy tissue and in cancer progression as well. Both stem cells and cancer stem cells have shown association with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in various tissue types. Aiming to investigate the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypic traits in adult mouse prostate, we sorted subpopulations of basal prostate stem cells (mPSCs) and assessed the expression levels of EMT regulators and markers with custom-designed gene expression array. The population of mPSCs defined by a Lin-/Sca-1+CD49fhi/Trop-2+ (LSC Trop-2+) surface phenotype was enriched in mesenchymal markers, especially EMT master regulator Slug, encoded by the Snai2 gene. To further dissect the role of Slug in mPSCs, we used transgenic Snai2tm1.1Wbg reporter mouse strain. Using this model, we confirmed the presence of mesenchymal traits and increase of organoid forming capacity in Slug+ population of mPSCs. The Slug+-derived organoids comprised all prostate epithelial cell types - basal, luminal, and neuroendocrine. Collectively, these data uncover the important role of Slug expression in the physiology of mouse prostate stem cells.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

33177648        	Synthetic lethality between MyD88 loss and mutations in Wnt/β-catenin pathway in intestinal tumor epithelial cells.            	Although the Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a central role in the carcinogenesis and maintenance of colorectal cancer (CRC), attempts to target the pathway itself have not been very successful. MyD88, an adaptor protein of the TLR/IL-1β signaling, has been implicated in the integrity of the intestines as well as in their tumorigenesis. In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanisms by which epithelial MyD88 contributes to intestinal tumor formation and to address whether MyD88 can be a therapeutic target of CRC. Conditional knockout of MyD88 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) reduced tumor formation in Apc+/Δ716 mice, accompanied by decreased proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of tumor epithelial cells. Mechanistically, the MyD88 loss caused inactivation of the JNK-mTORC1, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways in tumor cells. Induction of MyD88 knockout in the intestinal tumor-derived organoids, but not in the normal IEC-derived organoids, induced apoptosis and reduced their growth. Treatment with the MyD88 inhibitor ST2825 also suppressed the growth of the intestinal tumor-derived organoids. Knockdown of MYD88 in human CRC cell lines with mutations in APC or CTNNB1 induced apoptosis and reduced their proliferation as well. These results indicate that MyD88 loss is synthetic lethal with mutational activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in intestinal tumor epithelial cells. Inhibition of MyD88 signaling can thus be a novel therapeutic strategy for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as well as for colorectal cancer harboring mutations in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.	
30659943        	cAMP Stimulates SLC26A3 Activity in Human Colon by a CFTR-Dependent Mechanism That Does Not Require CFTR Activity.            	SLC26A3 (DRA) is an electroneutral Cl-/HCO3- exchanger that is present in the apical domain of multiple intestinal segments. An area that has continued to be poorly understood is related to DRA regulation in acute adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-related diarrheas, in which DRA appears to be both inhibited as part of NaCl absorption and stimulated to contribute to increased HCO3- secretion. Different cell models expressing DRA have shown that cAMP inhibits, stimulates, or does not affect its activity.                This study re-evaluated cAMP regulation of DRA using new tools, including a successful knockout cell model, a specific DRA inhibitor (DRAinh-A250), specific antibodies, and a transport assay that did not rely on nonspecific inhibitors. The studies compared DRA regulation in colonoids made from normal human colon with regulation in the colon cancer cell line, Caco-2.                DRA is an apical protein in human proximal colon, differentiated colonoid monolayers, and Caco-2 cells. It is glycosylated and appears as 2 bands. cAMP (forskolin) acutely stimulated DRA activity in human colonoids and Caco-2 cells. In these cells, DRA is the predominant apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger and is inhibited by DRAinh-A250 with a median inhibitory concentration of 0.5 and 0.2 μmol/L, respectively. However, there was no effect of cAMP in HEK293/DRA cells that lacked a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). When CFTR was expressed in HEK293/DRA cells, cAMP also stimulated DRA activity. In all cases, cAMP stimulation of DRA was not inhibited by CFTRinh-172.                DRA is acutely stimulated by cAMP by a process that is CFTR-dependent, but appears to be one of multiple regulatory effects of CFTR that does not require CFTR activity.

32965059        	RNF43 truncations trap CK1 to drive niche-independent self-renewal in cancer.            	Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a primary pathway for stem cell maintenance during tissue renewal and a frequent target for mutations in cancer. Impaired Wnt receptor endocytosis due to loss of the ubiquitin ligase RNF43 gives rise to Wnt-hypersensitive tumors that are susceptible to anti-Wnt-based therapy. Contrary to this paradigm, we identify a class of RNF43 truncating cancer mutations that induce β-catenin-mediated transcription, despite exhibiting retained Wnt receptor downregulation. These mutations interfere with a ubiquitin-independent suppressor role of the RNF43 cytosolic tail that involves Casein kinase 1 (CK1) binding and phosphorylation. Mechanistically, truncated RNF43 variants trap CK1 at the plasma membrane, thereby preventing β-catenin turnover and propelling ligand-independent target gene transcription. Gene editing of human colon stem cells shows that RNF43 truncations cooperate with p53 loss to drive a niche-independent program for self-renewal and proliferation. Moreover, these RNF43 variants confer decreased sensitivity to anti-Wnt-based therapy. Our data demonstrate the relevance of studying patient-derived mutations for understanding disease mechanisms and improved applications of precision medicine.                © 2020 The Authors.

32139672        	Vascular progenitors generated from tankyrase inhibitor-regulated naïve diabetic human iPSC potentiate efficient revascularization of ischemic retina.            	Here, we report that the functionality of vascular progenitors (VP) generated from normal and disease-primed conventional human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) can be significantly improved by reversion to a tankyrase inhibitor-regulated human naïve epiblast-like pluripotent state. Naïve diabetic vascular progenitors (N-DVP) differentiated from patient-specific naïve diabetic hiPSC (N-DhiPSC) possessed higher vascular functionality, maintained greater genomic stability, harbored decreased lineage-primed gene expression, and were more efficient in migrating to and re-vascularizing the deep neural layers of the ischemic retina than isogenic diabetic vascular progenitors (DVP). These findings suggest that reprogramming to a stable naïve human pluripotent stem cell state may effectively erase dysfunctional epigenetic donor cell memory or disease-associated aberrations in patient-specific hiPSC. More broadly, tankyrase inhibitor-regulated naïve hiPSC (N-hiPSC) represent a class of human stem cells with high epigenetic plasticity, improved multi-lineage functionality, and potentially high impact for regenerative medicine.	
27398792        	A recellularized human colon model identifies cancer driver genes.            	Refined cancer models are needed to bridge the gaps between cell line, animal and clinical research. Here we describe the engineering of an organotypic colon cancer model by recellularization of a native human matrix that contains cell-populated mucosa and an intact muscularis mucosa layer. This ex vivo system recapitulates the pathophysiological progression from APC-mutant neoplasia to submucosal invasive tumor. We used it to perform a Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis screen to identify genes that cooperate with mutant APC in driving invasive neoplasia. We identified 38 candidate invasion-driver genes, 17 of which, including TCF7L2, TWIST2, MSH2, DCC, EPHB1 and EPHB2 have been previously implicated in colorectal cancer progression. Six invasion-driver genes that have not, to our knowledge, been previously described were validated in vitro using cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays and ex vivo using recellularized human colon. These results demonstrate the utility of our organoid model for studying cancer biology.	
31906201        	Repurposing Antibacterial AM404 as a Potential Anticancer Drug for Targeting Colorectal Cancer Stem-Like Cells.            	Tumour-promoting inflammation is involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and therapeutic resistance. However, the antibiotics and antibacterial drugs and signalling that regulate the potency of anticancer treatment upon forced differentiation of cancer stem-like cell (CSC) are not fully defined yet. We screened an NIH-clinical collection of the small-molecule compound library of antibacterial/anti-inflammatory agents that identified potential candidate drugs targeting CRC-SC for differentiation. Selected compounds were validated in both in vitro organoids and ex vivo colon explant models for their differentiation induction, impediment on neoplastic cell growth, and to elucidate the mechanism of their anticancer activity. We initially focused on AM404, an anandamide uptake inhibitor. AM404 is a metabolite of acetaminophen with antibacterial activity, which showed high potential in preventing CRC-SC features, such as stemness/de-differentiation, migration and drug-resistance. Furthermore, AM404 suppressed the expression of FBXL5 E3-ligase, where AM404 sensitivity was mimicked by FBXL5-knockout. This study uncovers a new molecular mechanism for AM404-altering FBXL5 oncogene which mediates chemo-resistance and CRC invasion, thereby proposes to repurpose antibacterial AM404 as an anticancer agent.	
31857479        	Potassium channel dysfunction in human neuronal models of Angelman syndrome.            	Disruptions in the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene cause Angelman syndrome (AS). Whereas AS model mice have associated synaptic dysfunction and altered plasticity with abnormal behavior, whether similar or other mechanisms contribute to network hyperactivity and epilepsy susceptibility in AS patients remains unclear. Using human neurons and brain organoids, we demonstrate that UBE3A suppresses neuronal hyperexcitability via ubiquitin-mediated degradation of calcium- and voltage-dependent big potassium (BK) channels. We provide evidence that augmented BK channel activity manifests as increased intrinsic excitability in individual neurons and subsequent network synchronization. BK antagonists normalized neuronal excitability in both human and mouse neurons and ameliorated seizure susceptibility in an AS mouse model. Our findings suggest that BK channelopathy underlies epilepsy in AS and support the use of human cells to model human developmental diseases.

33498666        	Emerging Roles of Urine-Derived Components for the Management of Bladder Cancer: One Man's Trash Is Another Man's Treasure.            	Urinary bladder cancer (UBC) is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract in humans, with an estimated global prevalence of 1.1 million cases over 5 years. Because of its high rates of recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy, UBC is one of the most expensive cancers to treat, resulting in significant health care costs. The development of innovative molecular and cellular tools is necessary to refine patient stratification and help predict response to treatment. Urine is an underused resource of biological components shed from bladder tumors, such as exfoliated cells and extracellular vesicles, that could serve as molecular fingerprints and provide valuable biological insights into tumor phenotype and mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy. Additionally, characterization of urine-derived extracellular vesicles and cells could be used as reliable biomarkers for prediction of response to neoadjuvant therapy.	
33654196        	Tektin4 loss promotes triple-negative breast cancer metastasis through HDAC6-mediated tubulin deacetylation and increases sensitivity to HDAC6 inhibitor.            	Progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes a major unresolved clinical challenge, and effective targeted therapies are lacking. Because microtubule dynamics play pivotal roles in breast cancer metastasis, we performed RNA sequencing on 245 samples from TNBC patients to characterize the landscape of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Here, our transcriptome analyses revealed that low expression of one MAP, tektin4, indicated poor patient outcomes. Tektin4 loss led to a marked increase in TNBC migration, invasion, and metastasis and a decrease in microtubule stability. Mechanistically, we identified a novel microtubule-associated complex containing tektin4 and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Tektin4 loss increased the interaction between HDAC6 and α-tubulin, thus decreasing microtubule stability through HDAC6-mediated tubulin deacetylation. Significantly, we found that tektin4 loss sensitized TNBC cells, xenograft models, and patient-derived organoid models to the HDAC6-selective inhibitor ACY1215. Furthermore, tektin4 expression levels were positively correlated with microtubule stability levels in clinical samples. Together, our findings uncover a metastasis suppressor function of tektin4 and support clinical development of HDAC6 inhibition as a new therapeutic strategy for tektin4-deficient TNBC patients.	
28881081        	A genetically inducible porcine model of intestinal cancer.            	Transgenic porcine cancer models bring novel possibilities for research. Their physical similarities with humans enable the use of surgical procedures and treatment approaches used for patients, which facilitates clinical translation. Here, we aimed to develop an inducible oncopig model of intestinal cancer. Transgenic (TG) minipigs were generated using somatic cell nuclear transfer by handmade cloning. The pigs encode two TG cassettes: (a) an Flp recombinase-inducible oncogene cassette containing KRAS-G12D, cMYC, SV40LT - which inhibits p53 - and pRB and (b) a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible Flp recombinase activator cassette controlled by the intestinal epithelium-specific villin promoter. Thirteen viable transgenic minipigs were born. The ability of 4-OHT to activate the oncogene cassette was confirmed in vitro in TG colonic organoids and ex vivo in tissue biopsies obtained by colonoscopy. In order to provide proof of principle that the oncogene cassette could also successfully be activated in vivo, three pigs were perorally treated with 400 mg tamoxifen for 2 × 5 days. After two months, one pig developed a duodenal neuroendocrine carcinoma with a lymph node metastasis. Molecular analysis of the carcinoma and metastasis confirmed activation of the oncogene cassette. No tumor formation was observed in untreated TG pigs or in the remaining two treated pigs. The latter indicates that tamoxifen delivery can probably be improved. In summary, we have generated a novel inducible oncopig model of intestinal cancer, which has the ability to form metastatic disease already two months after induction. The model may be helpful in bridging the gap between basic research and clinical usage. It opens new venues for longitudinal studies of tumor development and evolution, for preclinical assessment of new anticancer regimens, for pharmacology and toxicology assessments, as well as for studies into biological mechanisms of tumor formation and metastasis.                © 2017 The Authors.

32105584        	Uncovering cell biology in the third dimension.            	Developmental biology has long benefited from studies of classic model organisms. These model systems have provided the fundamental understanding of general principles of development, as well as insight into genes and signaling pathways that control unique aspects of cell fate specification and tissue morphogenesis. Because human brain development cannot be studied in vivo, scientists have relied on these model systems to study basic principles underlying the development of this complex organ as many of these genes and signaling pathways play conserved roles in human development. However, recent studies have shown species-specific signatures in neurodevelopment such as the transcriptome of outer-radial glia, suggesting use of a human-derived model remains imperative. Over the past decade, human stem cell-derived brain organoids have emerged as a biologically relevant model system to study normal human brain development and neurological diseases. Here, we provide a historical perspective of this emerging model system, discuss current systems and limitations, and propose that new mechanistic insight into cell biology can be revealed using these three-dimensional brain structures.	
25858145        	Silencing β3 Integrin by Targeted ECO/siRNA Nanoparticles Inhibits EMT and Metastasis of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.            	Metastatic breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subcategory of breast cancer and currently lacks well-defined molecular targets for effective targeted therapies. Disease relapse, metastasis, and drug resistance render standard chemotherapy ineffective in the treatment of TNBC. Because previous studies coupled β3 integrin (ITGB3) to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, we exploited β3 integrin as a therapeutic target to treat TNBC by delivering β3 integrin siRNA via lipid ECO-based nanoparticles (ECO/siβ3). Treatment of TNBC cells with ECO/siβ3 was sufficient to effectively silence β3 integrin expression, attenuate TGFβ-mediated EMT and invasion, restore TGFβ-mediated cytostasis, and inhibit three-dimensional organoid growth. Modification of ECO/siβ3 nanoparticles with an RGD peptide via a PEG spacer enhanced siRNA uptake by post-EMT cells. Intravenous injections of RGD-targeted ECO/siβ3 nanoparticles in vivo alleviated primary tumor burden and, more importantly, significantly inhibited metastasis. In the span of 16 weeks of the experiments and observations, including primary tumor resection at week 9 and release from the treatment for 4 weeks, the mice bearing orthotopic, TGFβ-prestimulated MDA-MB-231 tumors that were treated with RGD-targeted ECO/siβ3 nanoparticles were free of metastases and relapse, in comparison with untreated mice. Collectively, these results highlight ECO/siβ3 nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic regimen to combat TNBC.                ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32966782        	SFPQ Depletion Is Synthetically Lethal with BRAFV600E in Colorectal Cancer Cells.            	Oncoproteins such as the BRAFV600E kinase endow cancer cells with malignant properties, but they also create unique vulnerabilities. Targeting of BRAFV600E-driven cytoplasmic signaling networks has proved ineffective, as patients regularly relapse with reactivation of the targeted pathways. We identify the nuclear protein SFPQ to be synthetically lethal with BRAFV600E in a loss-of-function shRNA screen. SFPQ depletion decreases proliferation and specifically induces S-phase arrest and apoptosis in BRAFV600E-driven colorectal and melanoma cells. Mechanistically, SFPQ loss in BRAF-mutant cancer cells triggers the Chk1-dependent replication checkpoint, results in decreased numbers and reduced activities of replication factories, and increases collision between replication and transcription. We find that BRAFV600E-mutant cancer cells and organoids are sensitive to combinations of Chk1 inhibitors and chemically induced replication stress, pointing toward future therapeutic approaches exploiting nuclear vulnerabilities induced by BRAFV600E.

33645544        	Integrating imaging and RNA-seq improves outcome prediction in cervical cancer.            	Approaches using a single type of data have been applied to classify human tumors. Here we integrate imaging features and transcriptomic data using a prospectively collected tumor bank. We demonstrate that increased maximum standardized uptake value on pretreatment 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography correlates with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene expression. We derived and validated 3 major molecular groups, namely squamous epithelial, squamous mesenchymal, and adenocarcinoma, using prospectively collected institutional (n = 67) and publicly available (n = 304) data sets. Patients with tumors of the squamous mesenchymal subtype showed inferior survival outcomes compared with the other 2 molecular groups. High mesenchymal gene expression in cervical cancer cells positively correlated with the capacity to form spheroids and with resistance to radiation. CaSki organoids were radiation-resistant but sensitive to the glycolysis inhibitor, 2-DG. These experiments provide a strategy for response prediction by integrating large data sets, and highlight the potential for metabolic therapy to influence EMT phenotypes in cervical cancer.	
31882951        	Microscale pressure measurements based on an immiscible fluid/fluid interface.            	A method of microscale pressure measurement based on immiscible fluid/fluid interface is proposed. This method utilizes observed curvature changes in a fluid/fluid interface, and can accurately report hydraulic pressure in fluids at length scales of 10 microns. The method is especially suited for measuring fluid pressure in micro-scale biological samples. Using this method, we probe fluid pressure build up in epithelial domes, murine mammary gland organoids embedded in hydrogel, and lumen pressure in the developing mouse embryo. Results reveal that the pressure developed across epithelial barriers is on the order of 100~300 Pa, and is modulated by ion channel activity.	
29120819        	Towards a defined ECM and small molecule based monolayer culture system for the expansion of mouse and human intestinal stem cells.            	Current ISC culture systems face significant challenges such as animal-derived or undefined matrix compositions, batch-to-batch variability (e.g. Matrigel-based organoid culture), and complexity of assaying cell aggregates such as organoids which renders the research and clinical translation of ISCs challenging. Here, through screening for suitable ECM components, we report a defined, collagen based monolayer culture system that supports the growth of mouse and human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) enriched for an Lgr5+ population comparable or higher to the levels found in a standard Matrigel-based organoid culture. The system, referred to as the Bolstering Lgr5 Transformational (BLT) Sandwich culture, comprises a collagen IV-coated porous substrate and a collagen I gel overlay which sandwich an IEC monolayer in between. The distinct collagen cues synergistically regulate IEC attachment, proliferation, and Lgr5 expression through maximizing the engagement of distinct cell surface adhesion receptors (i.e. integrin α2β1, integrin β4) and cell polarity. Further, we apply our BLT Sandwich system to identify that the addition of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor inhibitor (LDN-193189) improves the expansion of Lgr5-GFP+ cells from mouse small intestinal crypts by nearly 2.5-fold. Notably, the BLT Sandwich culture is capable of expanding human-derived IECs with higher LGR5 mRNA levels than conventional Matrigel culture, providing superior expansion of human LGR5+ ISCs. Considering the key roles Lgr5+ ISCs play in intestinal epithelial homeostasis and regeneration, we envision that our BLT Sandwich culture system holds great potential for understanding and manipulating ISC biology in vitro (e.g. for modeling ISC-mediated gut diseases) or for expanding a large number of ISCs for clinical utility (e.g. for stem cell therapy).

27113439        	Metastatic large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung arising from the uterus: A pitfall in lung cancer diagnosis.            	A 41-year-old female smoker presented with a vaginal mass. Gynecological examination showed a mass filling the uterine corpus, cervix, and vagina. A total abdominal hysterectomy was performed. Macroscopic findings included a large fragile mass involving the uterine cavity, cervix, and vagina. Histology revealed atypical ducts admixed with solid components consisting of large atypical cells. The initial pathological diagnosis was grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The patient was designated as stage II according to the 2008 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging. Two years later, two nodules were found in the upper lobe of the left lung, and the patient underwent an upper lobectomy. The masses, which exhibited solid and organoid growth patterns of large atypical cells, had histological characteristics of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung. However, the tumor was immunohistochemically positive for neuroendocrine markers, such as synaptophysin in addition to estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and the tumor was negative for thyroid transcription factor-1. These immunohistochemical results were almost identical to those of the solid portions of the uterine carcinoma. The final diagnosis was LCNEC combined with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus and lung metastasis of the LCNEC component of the endometrial carcinoma. LCNEC often arises in the lung, but it rarely arises in other organs. Some patients with metastatic components exhibited only a LCNEC pattern although the primary tumor was a mixed carcinoma consisting of LCNEC and other histology, like the present case. LCNEC is often poorly differentiated, especially in extrapulmonary primary organ LCNEC. Therefore, pathologists should consider metastatic carcinoma when they encounter lung LCNEC in a patient with a preceding extrapulmonary carcinoma composed of a poorly differentiated component or LCNEC component, and they should clarify tumor immunohistochemical characteristics to confirm the diagnosis.

25633197        	LPS receptor subunits have antagonistic roles in epithelial apoptosis and colonic carcinogenesis.            	Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is characterized by unlimited proliferation and suppression of apoptosis, selective advantages for tumor survival, and chemoresistance. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling is involved in both epithelial homeostasis and tumorigenesis, but the relative roles had by LPS receptor subunits CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are poorly understood. Our study showed that normal human colonocytes were CD14(+)TLR4(-), whereas cancerous tissues were CD14(+)TLR4(+), by immunofluorescent staining. Using a chemical-induced CRC model, increased epithelial apoptosis and decreased tumor multiplicity and sizes were observed in TLR4-mutant mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice with CD14(+)TLR4(+) colonocytes. WT mice intracolonically administered a TLR4 antagonist displayed tumor reduction associated with enhanced apoptosis in cancerous tissues. Mucosa-associated LPS content was elevated in response to CRC induction. Epithelial apoptosis induced by LPS hypersensitivity in TLR4-mutant mice was prevented by intracolonic administration of neutralizing anti-CD14. Moreover, LPS-induced apoptosis was observed in primary colonic organoid cultures derived from TLR4 mutant but not WT murine crypts. Gene silencing of TLR4 increased cell apoptosis in WT organoids, whereas knockdown of CD14 ablated cell death in TLR4-mutant organoids. In vitro studies showed that LPS challenge caused apoptosis in Caco-2 cells (CD14(+)TLR4(-)) in a CD14-, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C-, sphingomyelinase-, and protein kinase C-ζ-dependent manner. Conversely, expression of functional but not mutant TLR4 (Asp299Gly, Thr399Ile, and Pro714His) rescued cells from LPS/CD14-induced apoptosis. In summary, CD14-mediated lipid signaling induced epithelial apoptosis, whereas TLR4 antagonistically promoted cell survival and cancer development. Our findings indicate that dysfunction in the CD14/TLR4 antagonism may contribute to normal epithelial transition to carcinogenesis, and provide novel strategies for intervention against colorectal cancer.

33388316        	Colonic Epithelial-Derived Selenoprotein P Is the Source for Antioxidant-Mediated Protection in Colitis-Associated Cancer.            	Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) demonstrate nutritional selenium deficiencies and are at greater risk of developing colon cancer. Previously, we determined that global reduction of the secreted antioxidant selenium-containing protein, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), substantially increased tumor development in an experimental colitis-associated cancer (CAC) model. We next sought to delineate tissue-specific contributions of SELENOP to intestinal inflammatory carcinogenesis and define clinical context.                Selenop floxed mice crossed with Cre driver lines to delete Selenop from the liver, myeloid lineages, or intestinal epithelium were placed on an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate experimental CAC protocol. SELENOP loss was assessed in human ulcerative colitis (UC) organoids, and expression was queried in human and adult UC samples.                Although large sources of SELENOP, both liver- and myeloid-specific Selenop deletion failed to modify azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate-mediated tumorigenesis. Instead, epithelial-specific deletion increased CAC tumorigenesis, likely due to elevated oxidative stress with a resulting increase in genomic instability and augmented tumor initiation. SELENOP was down-regulated in UC colon biopsies and levels were inversely correlated with endoscopic disease severity and tissue S100A8 (calprotectin) gene expression.                Although global selenium status is typically assessed by measuring liver-derived plasma SELENOP levels, our results indicate that the peripheral SELENOP pool is dispensable for CAC. Colonic epithelial SELENOP is the main contributor to local antioxidant capabilities. Thus, colonic SELENOP is the most informative means to assess selenium levels and activity in IBD patients and may serve as a novel biomarker for UC disease severity and identify patients most predisposed to CAC development.

30467317        	High-throughput screens identify HSP90 inhibitors as potent therapeutics that target inter-related growth and survival pathways in advanced prostate cancer.            	The development of new treatments for castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) must address such challenges as intrinsic tumor heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity. Combined PTEN/TP53 alterations represent a major genotype of CRPC (25-30%) and are associated with poor outcomes. Using tumor-derived, castration-resistant Pten/Tp53 null luminal prostate cells for comprehensive, high-throughput, mechanism-based screening, we identified several vulnerabilities among >1900 compounds, including inhibitors of: PI3K/AKT/mTOR, the proteasome, the cell cycle, heat shock proteins, DNA repair, NFκB, MAPK, and epigenetic modifiers. HSP90 inhibitors were one of the most active compound classes in the screen and have clinical potential for use in drug combinations to enhance efficacy and delay the development of resistance. To inform future design of rational drug combinations, we tested ganetespib, a potent second-generation HSP90 inhibitor, as a single agent in multiple CRPC genotypes and phenotypes. Ganetespib decreased growth of endogenous Pten/Tp53 null tumors, confirming therapeutic activity in situ. Fifteen human CRPC LuCaP PDX-derived organoid models were assayed for responses to 110 drugs, and HSP90 inhibitors (ganetespib and onalespib) were among the select group of drugs (<10%) that demonstrated broad activity (>75% of models) at high potency (IC50 <1 µM). Ganetespib inhibits multiple targets, including AR and PI3K pathways, which regulate mutually compensatory growth and survival signals in some forms of CRPC. Combined with castration, ganetespib displayed deeper PDX tumor regressions and delayed castration resistance relative to either monotherapy. In all, comprehensive data from near-patient models presents novel contexts for HSP90 inhibition in multiple CRPC genotypes and phenotypes, expands upon HSP90 inhibitors as simultaneous inhibitors of oncogenic signaling and resistance mechanisms, and suggests utility for combined HSP90/AR inhibition in CRPC.	
28205621        	Cryogel-supported stem cell factory for customized sustained release of bispecific antibodies for cancer immunotherapy.            	Combining stem cells with biomaterial scaffolds provides a promising strategy for the development of drug delivery systems. Here we propose an innovative immunotherapeutic organoid by housing human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), gene-modified for the secretion of an anti-CD33-anti-CD3 bispecific antibody (bsAb), in a small biocompatible star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol)-heparin cryogel scaffold as a transplantable and low invasive therapeutic machinery for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The macroporous biohybrid cryogel platform displays effectiveness in supporting proliferation and survival of bsAb-releasing-MSCs overtime in vitro and in vivo, avoiding cell loss and ensuring a constant release of sustained and detectable levels of bsAb capable of triggering T-cell-mediated anti-tumor responses and a rapid regression of CD33+ AML blasts. This therapeutic device results as a promising and safe alternative to the continuous administration of short-lived immunoagents and paves the way for effective bsAb-based therapeutic strategies for future tumor treatments.	
28424327        	RIG-I/MAVS and STING signaling promote gut integrity during irradiation- and immune-mediated tissue injury.            	The molecular pathways that regulate the tissue repair function of type I interferon (IFN-I) during acute tissue damage are poorly understood. We describe a protective role for IFN-I and the RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway during acute tissue damage in mice. Mice lacking mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) were more sensitive to total body irradiation- and chemotherapy-induced intestinal barrier damage. These mice developed worse graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a preclinical model of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) than did wild-type mice. This phenotype was not associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota but was associated with reduced gut epithelial integrity. Conversely, targeted activation of the RIG-I pathway during tissue injury promoted gut barrier integrity and reduced GVHD. Recombinant IFN-I or IFN-I expression induced by RIG-I promoted growth of intestinal organoids in vitro and production of the antimicrobial peptide regenerating islet-derived protein 3 γ (RegIIIγ). Our findings were not confined to RIG-I/MAVS signaling because targeted engagement of the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway also protected gut barrier function and reduced GVHD. Consistent with this, STING-deficient mice suffered worse GVHD after allo-HSCT than did wild-type mice. Overall, our data suggest that activation of either RIG-I/MAVS or STING pathways during acute intestinal tissue injury in mice resulted in IFN-I signaling that maintained gut epithelial barrier integrity and reduced GVHD severity. Targeting these pathways may help to prevent acute intestinal injury and GVHD during allogeneic transplantation.                Copyright © 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.	
32929331        	Targeted inhibition of KDM6 histone demethylases eradicates tumor-initiating cells via enhancer reprogramming in colorectal cancer.            	Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) maintain heterogeneity within tumors and seed metastases at distant sites, contributing to therapeutic resistance and disease recurrence. In colorectal cancer (CRC), strategy that effectively eradicates TICs and is of potential value for clinical use still remains in need. Methods: The anti-tumorigenic activity of a small-molecule inhibitor of KDM6 histone demethylases named GSK-J4 in CRC was evaluated by in vitro assays and in vivo imaging of xenografted tumors. Sphere formation, flow cytometry analysis of cell surface markers and intestinal organoid formation were performed to examine the impact of GSK-J4 on TIC properties. Transcriptome analysis and global profiling of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and KDM6A levels by ChIP-seq were conducted to elucidate how KDM6 inhibition reshapes epigenetic landscape and thereby eliminating TICs. Results: GSK-J4 alleviated the malignant phenotypes of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, sensitized them to chemotherapeutic treatment, and strongly repressed TIC properties and stemness-associated gene signatures in these cells. Mechanistically, KDM6 inhibition induced global enhancer reprogramming with a preferential impact on super-enhancer-associated genes, including some key genes that control stemness in CRC such as ID1. Besides, expression of both Kdm6a and Kdm6b was more abundant in mouse intestinal crypt when compared with upper villus and inhibition of their activities blocked intestinal organoid formation. Finally, we unveiled the power of KDM6B in predicting both the overall survival outcome and recurrence of CRC patients. Conclusions: Our study provides a novel rational strategy to eradicate TICs through reshaping epigenetic landscape in CRC, which might also be beneficial for optimizing current therapeutics.                © The author(s).

33451351        	Radiation-induced toxicity in rectal epithelial stem cell contributes to acute radiation injury in rectum.            	Radiation-induced rectal epithelial damage is a very common side effect of pelvic radiotherapy and often compromise the life quality and treatment outcome in patients with pelvic malignancies. Unlike small bowel and colon, effect of radiation in rectal stem cells has not been explored extensively. Here we demonstrate that Lgr5-positive rectal stem cells are radiosensitive and organoid-based transplantation of rectal stem cells mitigates radiation damage in rectum.                C57Bl6 male mice (JAX) at 24 h were exposed to pelvic irradiation (PIR) to determine the radiation effect in pelvic epithelium. Effect of PIR on Lgr5-positive rectal stem cells (RSCs) was determined in Lgr5-EGFP-Cre-ERT2 mice exposed to PIR. Effect of PIR or clinically relevant fractionated PIR on regenerative response of Lgr5-positive RSCs was examined by lineage tracing assay using Lgr5-eGFP-IRES-CreERT2; Rosa26-CAG-tdTomato mice with tamoxifen administration to activate Cre recombinase and thereby marking the ISC and their respective progeny. Ex vivo three-dimensional organoid cultures were developed from Lgr5-EGFP-Cre-ERT2 mice. Organoid growth was determined by quantifying the budding crypt/total crypt ratio. Organoids from Lgr5-EGFP-ires-CreERT2-TdT mice were transplanted in C57Bl6 male mice exposed to PIR. Engraftment and repopulation of Lgr5-positive RSCs were determined after tamoxifen administration to activate Cre recombinase in recipient mice. Statistical analysis was performed using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and paired two-tail t test.                Exposure to pelvic irradiation significantly damaged rectal epithelium with the loss of Lgr5+ve rectal stem cells. Radiosensitivity of rectal epithelium was also observed with exposure to clinically relevant fractionated pelvic irradiation. Regenerative capacity of Lgr5+ve rectal stem cells was compromised in response to fractionated pelvic irradiation. Ex vivo organoid study demonstrated that Lgr5+ve rectal stem cells are sensitive to both single and fractionated radiation. Organoid-based transplantation of Lgr5+ve rectal stem cells promotes repair and regeneration of rectal epithelium.                Lgr5-positive rectal stem cells are radiosensitive and contribute to radiation-induced rectal epithelial toxicity. Transplantation of Lgr5-positive rectal stem cells mitigates radiation-induced rectal injury and promotes repair and regeneration process in rectum.	
26898331        	TGF-β Tumor Suppression through a Lethal EMT.            	TGF-β signaling can be pro-tumorigenic or tumor suppressive. We investigated this duality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which, with other gastrointestinal cancers, exhibits frequent inactivation of the TGF-β mediator Smad4. We show that TGF-β induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), generally considered a pro-tumorigenic event. However, in TGF-β-sensitive PDA cells, EMT becomes lethal by converting TGF-β-induced Sox4 from an enforcer of tumorigenesis into a promoter of apoptosis. This is the result of an EMT-linked remodeling of the cellular transcription factor landscape, including the repression of the gastrointestinal lineage-master regulator Klf5. Klf5 cooperates with Sox4 in oncogenesis and prevents Sox4-induced apoptosis. Smad4 is required for EMT but dispensable for Sox4 induction by TGF-β. TGF-β-induced Sox4 is thus geared to bolster progenitor identity, whereas simultaneous Smad4-dependent EMT strips Sox4 of an essential partner in oncogenesis. Our work demonstrates that TGF-β tumor suppression functions through an EMT-mediated disruption of a lineage-specific transcriptional network.                 Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

31221853        	The glycan CA19-9 promotes pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in mice.            	Glycosylation alterations are indicative of tissue inflammation and neoplasia, but whether these alterations contribute to disease pathogenesis is largely unknown. To study the role of glycan changes in pancreatic disease, we inducibly expressed human fucosyltransferase 3 and β1,3-galactosyltransferase 5 in mice, reconstituting the glycan sialyl-Lewisa, also known as carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). Notably, CA19-9 expression in mice resulted in rapid and severe pancreatitis with hyperactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Mechanistically, CA19-9 modification of the matricellular protein fibulin-3 increased its interaction with EGFR, and blockade of fibulin-3, EGFR ligands, or CA19-9 prevented EGFR hyperactivation in organoids. CA19-9-mediated pancreatitis was reversible and could be suppressed with CA19-9 antibodies. CA19-9 also cooperated with the KrasG12D oncogene to produce aggressive pancreatic cancer. These findings implicate CA19-9 in the etiology of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer and nominate CA19-9 as a therapeutic target.

28938087        	Emerging Opportunities for Target Discovery in Rare Cancers.            	Rare cancers pose unique challenges to research due to their low incidence. Barriers include a scarcity of tissue and experimental models to enable basic research and insufficient patient accrual for clinical studies. Consequently, an understanding of the genetic and cellular features of many rare cancer types and their associated vulnerabilities has been lacking. However, new opportunities are emerging to facilitate discovery of therapeutic targets in rare cancers. Online platforms are allowing patients with rare cancers to organize on an unprecedented scale, tumor genome sequencing is now routinely performed in research and clinical settings, and the efficiency of patient-derived model generation has improved. New CRISPR/Cas9 and small-molecule libraries permit cancer dependency discovery in a rapid and systematic fashion. In parallel, large-scale studies of common cancers now provide reference datasets to help interpret rare cancer profiling data. Together, these advances motivate consideration of new research frameworks to accelerate rare cancer target discovery.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	
31300688        	Self-organized intestinal epithelial monolayers in crypt and villus-like domains show effective barrier function.            	Intestinal organoids have emerged as a powerful in vitro tool for studying intestinal biology due to their resemblance to in vivo tissue at the structural and functional levels. However, their sphere-like geometry prevents access to the apical side of the epithelium, making them unsuitable for standard functional assays designed for flat cell monolayers. Here, we describe a simple method for the formation of epithelial monolayers that recapitulates the in vivo-like cell type composition and organization and that is suitable for functional tissue barrier assays. In our approach, epithelial monolayer spreading is driven by the substrate stiffness, while tissue barrier function is achieved by the basolateral delivery of medium enriched with stem cell niche and myofibroblast-derived factors. These monolayers contain major intestinal epithelial cell types organized into proliferating crypt-like domains and differentiated villus-like regions, closely resembling the in vivo cell distribution. As a unique characteristic, these epithelial monolayers form functional epithelial barriers with an accessible apical surface and physiologically relevant transepithelial electrical resistance values. Our technology offers an up-to-date and novel culture method for intestinal epithelium, providing an in vivo-like cell composition and distribution in a tissue culture format compatible with high-throughput drug absorption or microbe-epithelium interaction studies.	
33397937        	Simultaneous Zn2+ tracking in multiple organelles using super-resolution morphology-correlated organelle identification in living cells.            	Zn2+ plays important roles in metabolism and signaling regulation. Subcellular Zn2+ compartmentalization is essential for organelle functions and cell biology, but there is currently no method to determine Zn2+ signaling relationships among more than two different organelles with one probe. Here, we report simultaneous Zn2+ tracking in multiple organelles (Zn-STIMO), a method that uses structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and a single Zn2+ fluorescent probe, allowing super-resolution morphology-correlated organelle identification in living cells. To guarantee SIM imaging quality for organelle identification, we develop a new turn-on Zn2+ fluorescent probe, NapBu-BPEA, by regulating the lipophilicity of naphthalimide-derived Zn2+ probes to make it accumulate in multiple organelles except the nucleus. Zn-STIMO with this probe shows that CCCP-induced mitophagy in HeLa cells is associated with labile Zn2+ enhancement. Therefore, direct organelle identification supported by SIM imaging makes Zn-STIMO a reliable method to determine labile Zn2+ dynamics in various organelles with one probe. Finally, SIM imaging of pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids with NapBu-BPEA demonstrates the potential of super-resolution morphology-correlated organelle identification to track biospecies and events in specific organelles within organoids.	
32993034        	Three-Dimensional Cell Culture Systems in Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research.            	In preclinical cancer research, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems such as multicellular spheroids and organoids are becoming increasingly important. They provide valuable information before studies on animal models begin and, in some cases, are even suitable for reducing or replacing animal experiments. Furthermore, they recapitulate microtumors, metastases, and the tumor microenvironment much better than monolayer culture systems could. Three-dimensional models show higher structural complexity and diverse cell interactions while reflecting (patho)physiological phenomena such as oxygen and nutrient gradients in the course of their growth or development. These interactions and properties are of great importance for understanding the pathophysiological importance of stromal cells and the extracellular matrix for tumor progression, treatment response, or resistance mechanisms of solid tumors. Special emphasis is placed on co-cultivation with tumor-associated cells, which further increases the predictive value of 3D models, e.g., for drug development. The aim of this overview is to shed light on selected 3D models and their advantages and disadvantages, especially from the radiopharmacist's point of view with focus on the suitability of 3D models for the radiopharmacological characterization of novel radiotracers and radiotherapeutics. Special attention is paid to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as a predestined target for the development of new radionuclide-based theranostics.	
30459318        	A small molecule approach to degrade RAS with EGFR repression is a potential therapy for KRAS mutation-driven colorectal cancer resistance to cetuximab.            	Drugs targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), such as cetuximab and panitumumab, have been prescribed for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), but patients harboring KRAS mutations are insensitive to them and do not have an alternative drug to overcome the problem. The levels of β-catenin, EGFR, and RAS, especially mutant KRAS, are increased in CRC patient tissues due to mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which occur in 90% of human CRCs. The increases in these proteins by APC loss synergistically promote tumorigenesis. Therefore, we tested KYA1797K, a recently identified small molecule that degrades both β-catenin and Ras via GSK3β activation, and its capability to suppress the cetuximab resistance of KRAS-mutated CRC cells. KYA1797K suppressed the growth of tumor xenografts induced by CRC cells as well as tumor organoids derived from CRC patients having both APC and KRAS mutations. Lowering the levels of both β-catenin and RAS as well as EGFR via targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a therapeutic strategy for controlling CRC and other types of cancer with aberrantly activated the Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR-RAS pathways, including those with resistance to EGFR-targeting drugs attributed to KRAS mutations.	
27689335        	Co-application of canavanine and irradiation uncouples anticancer potential of arginine deprivation from citrulline availability.            	The moderate anticancer effect of arginine deprivation in clinical trials has been linked to an induced argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) expression in initially ASS1-negative tumors, and ASS1-positive cancers are anticipated as non-responders. Our previous studies indicated that arginine deprivation and low doses of the natural arginine analog canavanine can enhance radioresponse. However, the efficacy of the proposed combination in the presence of extracellular citrulline, the substrate for arginine synthesis by ASS1, remains to be elucidated, in particular for malignant cells with positive and/or inducible ASS1 as in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, the physiological citrulline concentration of 0.05 mM was insufficient to overcome cell cycle arrest and radiosensitization triggered by arginine deficiency. Hyperphysiological citrulline (0.4 mM) did not entirely compensate for the absence of arginine and significantly decelerated cell cycling. Similar levels of canavanine-induced apoptosis were detected in the absence of arginine regardless of citrulline supplementation both in 2-D and advanced 3-D assays, while normal colon epithelial cells in organoid/colonosphere culture were unaffected. Notably, canavanine tremendously enhanced radiosensitivity of arginine-starved 3-D CRC spheroids even in the presence of hyperphysiological citrulline. We conclude that the novel combinatorial targeting strategy of metabolic-chemo-radiotherapy has great potential for the treatment of malignancies with inducible ASS1 expression.	
33126717        	Modelling Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Cancer: From Bench Side to Clinic.            	Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) are a heterogeneous group of epithelial tumours with neuroendocrine differentiation. Although rare (incidence of <1 in 100,000), they are the second most common group of pancreatic neoplasms after pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). pNET incidence is however on the rise and patient outcomes, although variable, have been linked with 5-year survival rates as low as 40%. Improvement of diagnostic and treatment modalities strongly relies on disease models that reconstruct the disease ex vivo. A key constraint in pNET research, however, is the absence of human pNET models that accurately capture the original tumour phenotype. In attempts to more closely mimic the disease in its native environment, three-dimensional culture models as well as in vivo models, such as genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), have been developed. Despite adding significant contributions to our understanding of more complex biological processes associated with the development and progression of pNETs, factors such as ethical considerations and low rates of clinical translatability limit their use. Furthermore, a role for the site-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) in disease development and progression has become clear. Advances in tissue engineering have enabled the use of tissue constructs that are designed to establish disease ex vivo within a close to native ECM that can recapitulate tumour-associated tissue remodelling. Yet, such advanced models for studying pNETs remain underdeveloped. This review summarises the most clinically relevant disease models of pNETs currently used, as well as future directions for improved modelling of the disease.	
32784045        	Vitamin D analogues exhibit antineoplastic activity in breast cancer patient-derived xenograft cells.            	Despite advances in breast cancer (BC) treatment, its mortality remains high due to intrinsic or acquired resistance to therapy. Several ongoing efforts are being made to develop novel drugs to treat this pathology with the aim to overcome resistance, prolong patient survival and improve their quality of life. We have previously shown that the non-hypercalcemic vitamin D analogues EM1 and UVB1 display antitumor effects in preclinical studies employing conventional cell lines and animal models developed from these cells. In this work, we explored the antitumor effects of EM1 and UVB1 employing BC cells derived from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), which are a powerful preclinical tool for testing new drugs. We demonstrated that the analogues reduced the viability of HER2-positive and Triple Negative BC-PDXs. Moreover, using an in vitro model of acquired resistance to Trastuzumab-emtansine, UVB1 displayed anti-proliferative actions under 2D and 3D culture conditions. It inhibited both formation and growth of established organoids. In addition, a direct correlation between UVB1 antitumor effects and VDR expression in PDXs was found. In conclusion, all the results reinforce the potential use of these vitamin D analogues as antitumor agents to treat HER2-positive and Triple Negative BC.

31516191        	ESOPHAGEAL CANCERS AND MODEL SYSTEMS.            	Gastrointestinal cancers are largely epithelial in nature and arise from the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colorectum and liver. In aggregate, these cancers are the most common malignancies in the United States and worldwide, but suffer from poor outcomes in late stages. Our overall work aims to elucidate the following: 1) how normal epithelial cells become metaplastic and dysplastic; 2) how tumor cells invade and interact with activated fibroblasts and immune cells; and 3) how tumor cells disseminate into the circulation and colonize distant organs (metastatic organotropism). We develop three-dimensional cell culture models and genetically engineered mouse models to decipher mechanisms. Our overarching desire is to translate preclinical models to clinical trials that impact upon outcomes in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers. We will frame these principles and approaches in the context of esophageal cancers and three-dimensional models.	
32176591        	Taking a Full Snapshot of Cancer Biology: Deciphering the Tumor Microenvironment for Effective Cancer Therapy in the Oncology Clinic.            	A bottleneck that is hindering therapeutics innovation in cancers is the current lack of integration of what we have learned in tumor biology as well as the tumor microenvironment (TME). This is because tumors are complex tissues composed of cancer cells, stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Although genetic alterations might cause the initial uncontrolled growth, resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells and stromal cells play additional key roles within the TME and thus influence tumor initiation, progression, therapy resistance, and metastasis. Therapies targeting cancer cells are usually insufficient when the stromal component of the TME causes therapy resistance. For innovation in cancer treatment and to take a full snapshot of cancer biology, anticancer drug design must, therefore, target both cancer cells and the stromal component. This expert review critically examines the TME components such as cancer-associated fibroblasts and ECM that can be reprogrammed to create a tumor-suppressive environment, thereby aiding in tumor treatment. Better cancer experimental models that mimic the TME such as tumor spheroids, microfluidics, three dimensional (3D) bioprinted models, and organoids will allow deeper investigations of the TME complexity and can lead to the translation of basic tumor biology to effective cancer treatments. Ultimately, innovative cancer treatments and, by extension, improvement in cancer patients' outcomes will emerge from combinatorial drug development strategies targeting both cancer cells and stromal components of the TME. Combinatorial treatment strategies can take the form of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (targeting tumor cells and stromal components) and immunotherapy that is able to regulate immune responses against tumor cells. This expert review thus addresses a previously neglected knowledge gap in cancer drug design and development by broadening the focus in cancer biology to TME so as to empower disruptive health care innovations in the oncology clinic.	
26542396        	Cellular chloride and bicarbonate retention alters intracellular pH regulation in Cftr KO crypt epithelium.            	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an anion channel providing a major pathway for Cl(-) and HCO3 (-) efflux across the apical membrane of the epithelium. In the intestine, CF manifests as obstructive syndromes, dysbiosis, inflammation, and an increased risk for gastrointestinal cancer. Cftr knockout (KO) mice recapitulate CF intestinal disease, including intestinal hyperproliferation. Previous studies using Cftr KO intestinal organoids (enteroids) indicate that crypt epithelium maintains an alkaline intracellular pH (pHi). We hypothesized that Cftr has a cell-autonomous role in downregulating pHi that is incompletely compensated by acid-base regulation in its absence. Here, 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein microfluorimetry of enteroids showed that Cftr KO crypt epithelium sustains an alkaline pHi and resistance to cell acidification relative to wild-type. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Cftr KO enteroids exhibit downregulated transcription of base (HCO3 (-))-loading proteins and upregulation of the basolateral membrane HCO3 (-)-unloader anion exchanger 2 (Ae2). Although Cftr KO crypt epithelium had increased Ae2 expression and Ae2-mediated Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange with maximized gradients, it also had increased intracellular Cl(-) concentration relative to wild-type. Pharmacological reduction of intracellular Cl(-) concentration in Cftr KO crypt epithelium normalized pHi, which was largely Ae2-dependent. We conclude that Cftr KO crypt epithelium maintains an alkaline pHi as a consequence of losing both Cl(-) and HCO3 (-) efflux, which impairs pHi regulation by Ae2. Retention of Cl(-) and an alkaline pHi in crypt epithelium may alter several cellular processes in the proliferative compartment of Cftr KO intestine.

30995271        	Calcium-induced differentiation in normal human colonoid cultures: Cell-cell / cell-matrix adhesion, barrier formation and tissue integrity.            	The goal of the study was to assess calcium alone and Aquamin, a multi-mineral natural product that contains magnesium and detectable levels of 72 trace elements in addition to calcium, for capacity to affect growth and differentiation in colonoid cultures derived from histologically-normal human colon tissue.                Colonoid cultures were maintained in a low-calcium (0.25 mM) medium or in medium supplemented with an amount of calcium (1.5-3.0 mM), either from calcium alone or Aquamin for a period of two weeks. This was shown in a previous study to induce differentiation in colonoids derived from large adenomas. Changes in growth, morphological features and protein expression profile were assessed at the end of the incubation period using a combination of phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy, histology and immunohistology, proteomic assessment and transmission electron microscopy.                Unlike the previously-studied tumor-derived colonoids (which remained un-differentiated in the absence of calcium-supplementation), normal tissue colonoids underwent differentiation as indicated by gross and microscopic appearance, a low proliferative index and high-level expression of cytokeratin 20 in the absence of intervention (i.e., in control condition). Only modest additional changes were seen in these parameters with either calcium alone or Aquamin (providing up to 3.0 mM calcium). In spite of this, proteomic analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that both interventions induced strong up-regulation of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive functions, barrier formation and tissue integrity. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase in desmosomes in response to intervention.                These findings demonstrate that colonoids derived from histologically normal human tissue can undergo differentiation in the presence of a low ambient calcium concentration. However, higher calcium levels induce elaboration of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. These changes could lead to improved barrier function and improved colon tissue health.	
32835374        	Andrographis-mediated chemosensitization through activation of ferroptosis and suppression of β-catenin/Wnt-signaling pathways in colorectal cancer.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in the USA. As much as 50-60% of CRC patients develop resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapeutic regimens, attributing the increased overall morbidity and mortality. In view of the growing evidence that active principles in various naturally occurring botanicals can facilitate chemosensitization in cancer cells, herein, we undertook a comprehensive effort in interrogating the activity of one such botanical-andrographis-by analyzing its activity in CRC cell lines [both sensitive and 5FU resistant (5FUR)], a xenograft animal model and patient-derived tumor organoids. We observed that combined treatment with andrographis was synergistic and resulted in a significant and dose-dependent increase in the efficacy of 5FU in HCT116 and SW480 5FUR cells (P < 0.05), reduced clonogenic formation (P < 0.01) and increased rates of caspase-9-mediated apoptosis (P < 0.05). The genomewide expression analysis in cell lines led us to uncover that activation of ferroptosis and suppression of β-catenin/Wnt-signaling pathways were the key mediators for the anti-cancer and chemosensitizing effects of andrographis. Subsequently, we validated our findings in a xenograft animal model, as well as two independent CRC patient-derived organoids-which confirmed that combined treatment with andrographis was significantly more effective than 5FU and andrographis alone and that these effects were in part orchestrated through dysregulated expression of key genes (including HMOX1, GCLC, GCLM and TCF7L2) within the ferroptosis and Wnt-signaling pathways. Collectively, our data highlight that andrographis might offer a safe and inexpensive adjunctive therapeutic option in the management of CRC patients.                © The Author(s) 2020.

28381597        	Waging war against pancreatic cancer: an interview with David Tuveson.            	David Tuveson, Director of the Cancer Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, is a clinician-scientist with a longstanding interest in understanding and treating pancreatic cancer.

32231042        	Personalized Medicine-Current and Emerging Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosed worldwide and is heterogeneous both morphologically and molecularly. In an era of personalized medicine, the greatest challenge is to predict individual response to therapy and distinguish patients likely to be cured with surgical resection of tumors and systemic therapy from those resistant or non-responsive to treatment. Patients would avoid futile treatments, including clinical trial regimes and ultimately this would prevent under- and over-treatment and reduce unnecessary adverse side effects. In this review, the potential of specific biomarkers will be explored to address two key questions-1) Can the prognosis of patients that will fare well or poorly be determined beyond currently recognized prognostic indicators? and 2) Can an individual patient's response to therapy be predicted and those who will most likely benefit from treatment/s be identified? Identifying and validating key prognostic and predictive biomarkers and an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance and toxicity in CRC are important steps in order to personalize treatment. This review addresses recent data on biological prognostic and predictive biomarkers in CRC. In addition, patient cohorts most likely to benefit from currently available systemic treatments and/or targeted therapies are discussed in this review.	
28653571        	Chimeric antigen receptor T cells for the treatment of cancer and the future of preclinical models for predicting their toxicities.            	Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy has achieved highly promising results in clinical trials, particularly in B-cell malignancies. However, reports of serious adverse events including a number of patient deaths have raised concerns about safety of this treatment. Presently available preclinical models are not designed for predicting toxicities seen in human patients. Besides choosing the right animal model, careful considerations must be taken in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell design and the amount of T cells infused. The development of more sophisticated in vitro models and humanized mouse models for preclinical modeling and toxicity tests will help us to improve the design of clinical trials in cancer immunotherapy.	
33467651        	3D Cell Cultures as Prospective Models to Study Extracellular Vesicles in Cancer.            	The improvement of culturing techniques to model the environment and physiological conditions surrounding tumors has also been applied to the study of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cancer research. EVs role is not only limited to cell-to-cell communication in tumor physiology, they are also a promising source of biomarkers, and a tool to deliver drugs and induce antitumoral activity. In the present review, we have addressed the improvements achieved by using 3D culture models to evaluate the role of EVs in tumor progression and the potential applications of EVs in diagnostics and therapeutics. The most employed assays are gel-based spheroids, often utilized to examine the cell invasion rate and angiogenesis markers upon EVs treatment. To study EVs as drug carriers, a more complex multicellular cultures and organoids from cancer stem cell populations have been developed. Such strategies provide a closer response to in vivo physiology observed responses. They are also the best models to understand the complex interactions between different populations of cells and the extracellular matrix, in which tumor-derived EVs modify epithelial or mesenchymal cells to become protumor agents. Finally, the growth of cells in 3D bioreactor-like systems is appointed as the best approach to industrial EVs production, a necessary step toward clinical translation of EVs-based therapy.	
31956038        	Zika Virus Targets Glioblastoma Stem Cells through a SOX2-Integrin αvβ5 Axis.            	Zika virus (ZIKV) causes microcephaly by killing neural precursor cells (NPCs) and other brain cells. ZIKV also displays therapeutic oncolytic activity against glioblastoma (GBM) stem cells (GSCs). Here we demonstrate that ZIKV preferentially infected and killed GSCs and stem-like cells in medulloblastoma and ependymoma in a SOX2-dependent manner. Targeting SOX2 severely attenuated ZIKV infection, in contrast to AXL. As mechanisms of SOX2-mediated ZIKV infection, we identified inverse expression of antiviral interferon response genes (ISGs) and positive correlation with integrin αv (ITGAV). ZIKV infection was disrupted by genetic targeting of ITGAV or its binding partner ITGB5 and by an antibody specific for integrin αvβ5. ZIKV selectively eliminated GSCs from species-matched human mature cerebral organoids and GBM surgical specimens, which was reversed by integrin αvβ5 inhibition. Collectively, our studies identify integrin αvβ5 as a functional cancer stem cell marker essential for GBM maintenance and ZIKV infection, providing potential brain tumor therapy.

29844449        	Targeting LGR5 in Colorectal Cancer: therapeutic gold or too plastic?            	Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor (LGR5 or GPR49) potentiates canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling and is a marker of normal stem cells in several tissues, including the intestine. Consistent with stem cell potential, single isolated LGR5+ cells from the gut generate self-organising crypt/villus structures in vitro termed organoids or 'mini-guts', which accurately model the parent tissue. The well characterised deregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling that occurs during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in colorectal cancer (CRC) renders LGR5 an interesting therapeutic target. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrating that CRC tumours contain LGR5+ subsets and retain a degree of normal tissue architecture has heightened translational interest. Such reports fuel hope that specific subpopulations or molecules within a tumour may be therapeutically targeted to prevent relapse and induce long-term remissions. Despite these observations, many studies within this field have produced conflicting and confusing results with no clear consensus on the therapeutic value of LGR5. This review will recap the various oncogenic and tumour suppressive roles that have been described for the LGR5 molecule in CRC. It will further highlight recent studies indicating the plasticity or redundancy of LGR5+ cells in intestinal cancer progression and assess the overall merit of therapeutically targeting LGR5 in CRC.	
27805831        	Establishment of a tumour-stroma airway model (OncoCilAir) to accelerate the development of human therapies against lung cancer.            	This paper highlights the work for which OncoTheis, a Swiss biotechnology company, engaged in the development of innovative bioengineered tissues and organoids for cancer research, was co-awarded the 2015 Lush Science Prize. Noting that the use of animal models failed to lead to the design of effective treatments for cancer, OncoTheis has opted to develop in vitro models based exclusively on human cells. The company currently focuses on lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with more than one million deaths per year. To address this public health concern, we developed OncoCilAir™, a new 3-D model that mimics in vitro the progression of the disease as it happens in patients. In this system, bronchial and lung tumour cells obtained from discarded surgical tissue are cocultured in a Petri dish to reconstitute a fragment of the human lung. After appropriate differentiation, the culture closely reproduces malignant pulmonary nodules invading a small piece of functional airway tissue. As OncoCilAir includes both healthy and cancerous tissues, it can be used to test tumour-killing activity and the adverse effects of chemotherapies and other anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, a single culture can be maintained for up to three months, which permits studies of longer-term effects, including the assessment of drug resistance and tumour recurrence. OncoCilAir heralds a new generation of integrated in vitro models, which is expected to increase the quality of preclinical research while replacing animal testing.                2016 FRAME.	
30273442        	Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 deletion protects the colonic epithelium against inflammation and promotes both proliferation and tumorigenesis.            	The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway controls fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) regulates cytoplasmic MAPK signaling by dephosphorylating and inactivating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) MAPK. To determine the role of DUSP6 in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, we characterized the intestinal epithelial phenotype of Dusp6 knockout (KO) mice under normal, oncogenic, and proinflammatory conditions. Our results show that loss of Dusp6 increased crypt depth and epithelial cell proliferation without altering colonic architecture. Crypt regeneration capacity was also enhanced, as revealed by ex vivo Dusp6 KO organoid cultures. Additionally, loss of Dusp6 induced goblet cell expansion without affecting enteroendocrine and absorptive cell differentiation. Our data also demonstrate that Dusp6 KO mice were protected from acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, as opposed to wild-type mice. In addition, Dusp6 gene deletion markedly enhanced tumor load in Apc Min/+ mice. Decreased DUSP6 expression by RNA interference in HT29 colorectal cancer cells enhanced ERK1/2 activation levels and promoted both anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as well as invasion through Matrigel. Finally, DUSP6 mRNA expression in human colorectal tumors was decreased in advanced stage tumors compared with paired normal tissues. These results demonstrate that DUSP6 phosphatase, by controlling ERK1/2 activation, regulates colonic inflammatory responses, and protects the intestinal epithelium against oncogenic stress.                © 2018 The Authors.

31289894        	Functional mismatch repair and inactive p53 drive sensitization of colorectal cancer cells to irinotecan via the IAP antagonist BV6.            	A common strategy to overcome acquired chemotherapy resistance is the combination of a specific anticancer drug (e.g., topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan) together with a putative sensitizer. The purpose of this study was to analyze the cytostatic/cytotoxic response of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells to irinotecan, depending on the mismatch repair (MMR) and p53 status and to examine the impact of BV6, a bivalent antagonist of inhibitors of apoptosis c-IAP1/c-IAP2, alone or combined with irinotecan. Therefore, several MSH2- or MSH6-deficient cell lines were complemented for MMR deficiency, or MSH6 was knocked out/down in MMR-proficient cells. Upon irinotecan, MMR-deficient/p53-mutated lines repaired DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination less efficiently than MMR-proficient/p53-mutated lines and underwent elevated caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. Opposite, BV6-mediated sensitization was achieved only in MMR-proficient/p53-mutated cells. In those cells, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were effectively degraded by BV6, caspase-8 was fully activated, and both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling were triggered. The results were confirmed ex vivo in tumor organoids from CRC patients. Therefore, the particular MMR+/p53mt signature, often found in non-metastasizing (stage II) CRC might be used as a prognostic factor for an adjuvant therapy using low-dose irinotecan combined with a bivalent IAP antagonist.	
33327663        	Three-Dimensional Cell Culture Models to Investigate Oral Carcinogenesis: A Scoping Review.            	Three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture models, such as spheroids, organoids, and organotypic cultures, are more physiologically representative of the human tumor microenvironment (TME) than traditional two-dimensional (2-D) cell culture models. They have been used as in vitro models to investigate various aspects of oral cancer but, to date, have not be widely used in investigations of the process of oral carcinogenesis. The aim of this scoping review was to evaluate the use of 3-D cell cultures in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) research, with a particular emphasis on oral carcinogenesis studies. Databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were systematically searched to identify research applying 3-D cell culture techniques to cells from normal, dysplastic, and malignant oral mucosae. A total of 119 studies were included for qualitative analysis including 53 studies utilizing spheroids, 62 utilizing organotypic cultures, and 4 using organoids. We found that 3-D oral carcinogenesis studies had been limited to just two organotypic culture models and that to date, spheroids and organoids had not been utilized for this purpose. Spheroid culture was most frequently used as a tumorosphere forming assay and the organoids cultured from human OSCCs most often used in drug sensitivity testing. These results indicate that there are significant opportunities to utilize 3-D cell culture to explore the development of oral cancer, particularly as the physiological relevance of these models continues to improve.	
32518160        	Helicobacter pylori infection downregulates the DNA glycosylase NEIL2, resulting in increased genome damage and inflammation in gastric epithelial cells.            	Infection with the Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium Helicobacter pylori induces an inflammatory response and oxidative DNA damage in gastric epithelial cells that can lead to gastric cancer (GC). However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism is largely unclear. Here, we report that the suppression of Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2), a mammalian DNA glycosylase that specifically removes oxidized bases, is one mechanism through which H. pylori infection may fuel the accumulation of DNA damage leading to GC. Using cultured cell lines, gastric biopsy specimens, primary cells, and human enteroid-derived monolayers from healthy human stomach, we show that H. pylori infection greatly reduces NEIL2 expression. The H. pylori infection-induced downregulation of NEIL2 was specific, as Campylobacter jejuni had no such effect. Using gastric organoids isolated from the murine stomach in coculture experiments with live bacteria mimicking the infected stomach lining, we found that H. pylori infection is associated with the production of various inflammatory cytokines. This response was more pronounced in Neil2 knockout (KO) mouse cells than in WT cells, suggesting that NEIL2 suppresses inflammation under physiological conditions. Notably, the H. pylori-infected Neil2-KO murine stomach exhibited more DNA damage than the WT. Furthermore, H. pylori-infected Neil2-KO mice had greater inflammation and more epithelial cell damage. Computational analysis of gene expression profiles of DNA glycosylases in gastric specimens linked the reduced Neil2 level to GC progression. Our results suggest that NEIL2 downregulation is a plausible mechanism by which H. pylori infection impairs DNA damage repair, amplifies the inflammatory response, and initiates GC.                © 2020 Sayed et al.	
32546576        	Lineage Reversion Drives WNT Independence in Intestinal Cancer.            	The WNT pathway is a fundamental regulator of intestinal homeostasis, and hyperactivation of WNT signaling is the major oncogenic driver in colorectal cancer. To date, there are no described mechanisms that bypass WNT dependence in intestinal tumors. Here, we show that although WNT suppression blocks tumor growth in most organoid and in vivo colorectal cancer models, the accumulation of colorectal cancer-associated genetic alterations enables drug resistance and WNT-independent growth. In intestinal epithelial cells harboring mutations in KRAS or BRAF, together with disruption of TP53 and SMAD4, transient TGFβ exposure drives YAP/TAZ-dependent transcriptional reprogramming and lineage reversion. Acquisition of embryonic intestinal identity is accompanied by a permanent loss of adult intestinal lineages, and long-term WNT-independent growth. This work identifies genetic and microenvironmental factors that drive WNT inhibitor resistance, defines a new mechanism for WNT-independent colorectal cancer growth, and reveals how integration of associated genetic alterations and extracellular signals can overcome lineage-dependent oncogenic programs. SIGNIFICANCE: Colorectal and intestinal cancers are driven by mutations in the WNT pathway, and drugs aimed at suppressing WNT signaling are in active clinical development. Our study identifies a mechanism of acquired resistance to WNT inhibition and highlights a potential strategy to target those drug-resistant cells.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1426.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32832918        	α-Ketoglutarate attenuates Wnt signaling and drives differentiation in colorectal cancer.            	Genetic-driven deregulation of the Wnt pathway is crucial but not sufficient for colorectal cancer (CRC) tumourigenesis. Here, we show that environmental glutamine restriction further augments Wnt signaling in APC mutant intestinal organoids to promote stemness and leads to adenocarcinoma formation in vivo via decreasing intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) levels. aKG supplementation is sufficient to rescue low-glutamine induced stemness and Wnt hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we found that aKG promotes hypomethylation of DNA and histone H3K4me3, leading to an upregulation of differentiation-associated genes and downregulation of Wnt target genes, respectively. Using CRC patient-derived organoids and several in vivo CRC tumour models, we show that aKG supplementation suppresses Wnt signaling and promotes cellular differentiation, thereby significantly restricting tumour growth and extending survival. Together, our results reveal how metabolic microenvironment impacts Wnt signaling and identify aKG as a potent antineoplastic metabolite for potential differentiation therapy for CRC patients.	
26844272        	BCL9/9L-β-catenin Signaling is Associated With Poor Outcome in Colorectal Cancer.            	BCL9/9L proteins enhance the transcriptional output of the β-catenin/TCF transcriptional complex and contribute critically to upholding the high WNT signaling level required for stemness maintenance in the intestinal epithelium. Here we show that a BCL9/9L-dependent gene signature derived from independent mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) models unprecedentedly separates patient subgroups with regard to progression free and overall survival. We found that this effect was by and large attributable to stemness related gene sets. Remarkably, this signature proved associated with recently described poor prognosis CRC subtypes exhibiting high stemness and/or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits. Consistent with the notion that high WNT signaling is required for stemness maintenance, ablating Bcl9/9l-β-catenin in murine oncogenic intestinal organoids provoked their differentiation and completely abrogated their tumorigenicity, while not affecting their proliferation. Therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting WNT responses may be limited by intestinal toxicity. Our findings suggest that attenuating WNT signaling to an extent that affects stemness maintenance without disturbing intestinal renewal might be well tolerated and prove sufficient to reduce CRC recurrence and dramatically improve disease outcome.	
30590435        	Melatonin-mediated downregulation of thymidylate synthase as a novel mechanism for overcoming 5-fluorouracil associated chemoresistance in colorectal cancer cells.            	5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has been established as the first-line chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC); however, acquired chemoresistance is often the cause of poor therapeutic response. Melatonin is a molecule that is associated with circadian rhythms. Although antitumor effects of melatonin have been shown, the underlying mechanism(s) for its activity and its effect, if any, in chemoresistant CRC has not been studied. We aimed to investigate antitumor effects of melatonin, and more specifically its effect on molecular mechanisms in 5-FU resistant CRC cells.                The cell growth was assessed in CRC cells, patient-derived organoids and 5-FU resistant CRC cells after treatments with melatonin. In addition, the expression of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are targeting TYMS were examined.                We observed that melatonin inhibited the cell growth in 5-FU resistant CRC cells. In addition, we found that melatonin significantly promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, a combination of melatonin and 5-FU markedly enhanced 5-FU-mediated cytotoxicity in 5-FU resistant cells. In addition, melatonin significantly decreased the expression of TYMS. Interestingly, this effect was manifested through the simultaneous increase in the expression of miR-215-5p, for which, TYMS serves as the direct downstream target for this miRNA.                Melatonin facilitates overcoming 5-FU resistance through downregulation of TYMS. Melatonin may serve as a potential therapeutic option on its own, or in conjunction with 5-FU, in the treatment of patients with advanced or chemoresistant CRC.Melatonin inhibits the growth of 5-FU resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells through upregulation of miR-215-5p and a concomitant downregulation of TYMS. Melatonin may serve as a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with advanced or chemoresistant CRC.                © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

29330203        	Personalized RNA Medicine for Pancreatic Cancer.            	Purpose: Since drug responses vary between patients, it is crucial to develop pre-clinical or co-clinical strategies that forecast patient response. In this study, we tested whether RNA-based therapeutics were suitable for personalized medicine by using patient-derived-organoid (PDO) and patient-derived-xenograft (PDX) models.Experimental Design: We performed microRNA (miRNA) profiling of PDX samples to determine the status of miRNA deregulation in individual pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. To deliver personalized RNA-based-therapy targeting oncogenic miRNAs that form part of this common PDAC miRNA over-expression signature, we packaged antimiR oligonucleotides against one of these miRNAs in tumor-penetrating nanocomplexes (TPN) targeting cell surface proteins on PDAC tumors.Results: As a validation for our pre-clinical strategy, the therapeutic potential of one of our nano-drugs, TPN-21, was first shown to decrease tumor cell growth and survival in PDO avatars for individual patients, then in their PDX avatars.Conclusions: This general approach appears suitable for co-clinical validation of personalized RNA medicine and paves the way to prospectively identify patients with eligible miRNA profiles for personalized RNA-based therapy.

32345968        	Engineered niches support the development of human dendritic cells in humanized mice.            	Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) are rare sentinel cells specialized in the regulation of adaptive immunity. Modeling cDC development is crucial to study cDCs and harness their therapeutic potential. Here we address whether cDCs could differentiate in response to trophic cues delivered by mesenchymal components of the hematopoietic niche. We find that mesenchymal stromal cells engineered to express membrane-bound FLT3L and stem cell factor (SCF) together with CXCL12 induce the specification of human cDCs from CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Engraftment of engineered mesenchymal stromal cells (eMSCs) together with CD34+ HSPCs creates an in vivo synthetic niche in the dermis of immunodeficient mice driving the differentiation of cDCs and CD123+AXL+CD327+ pre/AS-DCs. cDC2s generated in vivo display higher levels of resemblance with human blood cDCs unattained by in vitro-generated subsets. Altogether, eMSCs provide a unique platform recapitulating the full spectrum of cDC subsets enabling their functional characterization in vivo.	
28825721        	Knockdown of IRE1α inhibits colonic tumorigenesis through decreasing β-catenin and IRE1α targeting suppresses colon cancer cells.            	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs frequently in cancers. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to cope with ER stress. This has generated widespread interest in targeting UPR as therapeutic strategies. Inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease 1α (IRE1α), an ER stress sensor, is a key component of UPR. However, the role of IRE1α in tumorigenesis remains unclear. The purpose of this work is to investigate the role of IRE1α in colon cancer and to determine whether IRE1α could serve as a target for therapy. We found that knockdown of IRE1α suppressed the proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. Inhibition of expression of IRE1α decreased stemness of colon cancer stem cells (CSCs) and attenuated growth of intestinal organoids. Genetic ablation of IRE1α prevented the colitis-associated colonic tumorigenesis in mice. The mechanistic study indicates that knockdown of IRE1α repressed the expression of β-catenin, a key factor that drives colonic tumorigenesis, through activating pancreatic ER kinase/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α signaling. We found that the IRE1a-specific inhibitor 4μ8C could suppress the production of β-catenin, inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells, repressed colon CSCs and prevented xenograft growth. The results suggest that IRE1α has a critical role in colonic tumorigenesis and IRE1α targeting might be a strategy for treatment of colon cancers.	
26949039        	System-Wide Modulation of HECT E3 Ligases with Selective Ubiquitin Variant Probes.            	HECT-family E3 ligases ubiquitinate protein substrates to control virtually every eukaryotic process and are misregulated in numerous diseases. Nonetheless, understanding of HECT E3s is limited by a paucity of selective and potent modulators. To overcome this challenge, we systematically developed ubiquitin variants (UbVs) that inhibit or activate HECT E3s. Structural analysis of 6 HECT-UbV complexes revealed UbV inhibitors hijacking the E2-binding site and activators occupying a ubiquitin-binding exosite. Furthermore, UbVs unearthed distinct regulation mechanisms among NEDD4 subfamily HECTs and proved useful for modulating therapeutically relevant targets of HECT E3s in cells and intestinal organoids, and in a genetic screen that identified a role for NEDD4L in regulating cell migration. Our work demonstrates versatility of UbVs for modulating activity across an E3 family, defines mechanisms and provides a toolkit for probing functions of HECT E3s, and establishes a general strategy for systematic development of modulators targeting families of signaling proteins.

25313057        	RUNX1 is essential for mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation.            	Myofibroblasts are a key cell type in wound repair, cardiovascular disease, and fibrosis and in the tumor-promoting microenvironment. The high accumulation of myofibroblasts in reactive stroma is predictive of the rate of cancer progression in many different tumors, yet the cell types of origin and the mechanisms that regulate proliferation and differentiation are unknown. We report here, for the first time to our knowledge, the characterization of normal human prostate-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the TGF-β1-regulated pathways that modulate MSC proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation. Human prostate MSCs combined with prostate cancer cells expressing TGF-β1 resulted in commitment to myofibroblasts. TGF-β1-regulated runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) was required for cell cycle progression and proliferation of progenitors. RUNX1 also inhibited, yet did not block, differentiation. Knockdown of RUNX1 in prostate or bone marrow-derived MSCs resulted in cell cycle arrest, attenuated proliferation, and constitutive differentiation to myofibroblasts. These data show that RUNX1 is a key transcription factor for MSC proliferation and cell fate commitment in myofibroblast differentiation. This work also shows that the normal human prostate gland contains tissue-derived MSCs that exhibit multilineage differentiation similar to bone marrow-derived MSCs. Targeting RUNX1 pathways may represent a therapeutic approach to affect myofibroblast proliferation and biology in multiple disease states.	
32054830        	CUL4B contributes to cancer stemness by repressing tumor suppressor miR34a in colorectal cancer.            	Given that colorectal cancer stem cells (CCSCs) play key roles in the tumor dormancy, metastasis, and relapse, targeting CCSCs is a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Here, we aimed to identify the new regulators of CCSCs and found that Cullin 4B (CUL4B), which possesses oncogenic properties in multiple solid tumors, drives the development and metastasis of colon cancer by sustaining cancer stem-like features. Elevated expression of CUL4B was confirmed in colon tumors and was associated with poor overall survival. Inhibition of CUL4B in cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumor organoids led to reduced sphere formation, proliferation and metastasis capacity. Mechanistically, CUL4B coordinates with PRC2 complex to repress miR34a expression, thus upregulates oncogenes including MYCN and NOTCH1, which are targeted by miR34a. Furthermore, we found that elevated CUL4B expression is associated with miR34a downregulation and upregulation of miR34a target genes in colon cancer specimens. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CUL4B functions to repress miR34a in maintaining cancer stemness in CRC and provides a potential therapeutic target.	
32915138        	A single-cell atlas of the mouse and human prostate reveals heterogeneity and conservation of epithelial progenitors.            	Understanding the cellular constituents of the prostate is essential for identifying the cell of origin for prostate adenocarcinoma. Here, we describe a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the adult mouse prostate epithelium, which displays extensive heterogeneity. We observe distal lobe-specific luminal epithelial populations (LumA, LumD, LumL, and LumV), a proximally enriched luminal population (LumP) that is not lobe-specific, and a periurethral population (PrU) that shares both basal and luminal features. Functional analyses suggest that LumP and PrU cells have multipotent progenitor activity in organoid formation and tissue reconstitution assays. Furthermore, we show that mouse distal and proximal luminal cells are most similar to human acinar and ductal populations, that a PrU-like population is conserved between species, and that the mouse lateral prostate is most similar to the human peripheral zone. Our findings elucidate new prostate epithelial progenitors, and help resolve long-standing questions about anatomical relationships between the mouse and human prostate.                © 2020, Crowley et al.

30098400        	Tannins from Syzygium guineense suppress Wnt signaling and proliferation of Wnt-dependent tumors through a direct effect on secreted Wnts.            	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and colon cancer (CC) are two stigmatic examples of poorly treatable tumors, whose progression critically depends upon hyperactivation of the Wnt signaling. Development of specific anti-Wnt inhibitors is required to develop drugs against these and other Wnt-dependent cancers. Natural products, especially plants, have been used for the treatment of various diseases from ancient times. We examined extracts from several indigenous Cameroonian herbs and tested their effects on proliferation and Wnt signaling in TNBC and CC cells. Extracts from "fruit rouge", Syzygium guineense Wall. (Myrtaceae), demonstrated a strong activity against these cancer cells, as well as CC organoids. We found TNBC cells to significantly upregulate expression of Wnt3a, and the effects of S. guineense extracts on TNBC cell proliferation correlated with inhibition of the Wnt3a-induced β-catenin stabilization and transcriptional response. HPLC analysis revealed that the active components belong to tannins. We found a direct destabilizing effect of S. guineense extract on Wnt3a and other Wnt proteins, identifying a novel mechanism of action of tannins on the Wnt signaling pathway and cancer cell proliferation. Being edible, this African plant may have an important cancer-preventive nutritional value.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
29872037        	Composite regulation of ERK activity dynamics underlying tumour-specific traits in the intestine.            	Acting downstream of many growth factors, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) plays a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, where its spatiotemporal dynamics, as well as its strength, determine cellular responses. Here, we uncover the ERK activity dynamics in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and their association with tumour characteristics. Intravital imaging identifies two distinct modes of ERK activity, sustained and pulse-like activity, in IECs. The sustained and pulse-like activities depend on ErbB2 and EGFR, respectively. Notably, activation of Wnt signalling, the earliest event in intestinal tumorigenesis, augments EGFR signalling and increases the frequency of ERK activity pulses through controlling the expression of EGFR and its regulators, rendering IECs sensitive to EGFR inhibition. Furthermore, the increased pulse frequency is correlated with increased cell proliferation. Thus, ERK activity dynamics are defined by composite inputs from EGFR and ErbB2 signalling in IECs and their alterations might underlie tumour-specific sensitivity to pharmacological EGFR inhibition.	
27677718        	Human mini-guts: new insights into intestinal physiology and host-pathogen interactions.            	The development of indefinitely propagating human 'mini-guts' has led to a rapid advance in gastrointestinal research related to transport physiology, developmental biology, pharmacology, and pathophysiology. These mini-guts, also called enteroids or colonoids, are derived from LGR5+ intestinal stem cells isolated from the small intestine or colon. Addition of WNT3A and other growth factors promotes stemness and results in viable, physiologically functional human intestinal or colonic cultures that develop a crypt-villus axis and can be differentiated into all intestinal epithelial cell types. The success of research using human enteroids has highlighted the limitations of using animals or in vitro, cancer-derived cell lines to model transport physiology and pathophysiology. For example, curative or preventive therapies for acute enteric infections have been limited, mostly due to the lack of a physiological human intestinal model. However, the human enteroid model enables specific functional studies of secretion and absorption in each intestinal segment as well as observations of the earliest molecular events that occur during enteric infections. This Review describes studies characterizing these human mini-guts as a physiological model to investigate intestinal transport and host-pathogen interactions.	
31419632        	Paracrine Crosstalk between Fibroblasts and ER+ Breast Cancer Cells Creates an IL1β-Enriched Niche that Promotes Tumor Growth.            	Breast cancer-induced activated fibroblasts support tumor progression. However, the role of normal fibroblasts in tumor progression remains controversial. In this study, we used modified patient-derived organoid cultures and demonstrate that constitutively secreted cytokines from normal breast fibroblasts initiate a paracrine signaling mechanism with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells, which results in the creation of an interleukin (IL)-1β-enriched microenvironment. We found that this paracrine signaling mechanism is shared between normal and activated fibroblasts. Interestingly, we observed that in reconstructed tumor microenvironment containing autologous ER+ breast cancer cells, activated fibroblasts, and immune cells, tamoxifen is more effective in reducing tumor cell proliferation when this paracrine signaling is blocked. Our findings then suggest that ER+ tumor cells could create a growth-promoting environment without activating stromal fibroblasts and that in breast-conserving surgeries, normal fibroblasts could be a significant modulator of tumor recurrence by enhancing the proliferation of residual breast cancer cells in the tumor-adjacent breast tissue.

33558541        	Distinct mechanisms for TMPRSS2 expression explain organ-specific inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzalutamide.            	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a global public health threat. The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs, a second-generation antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and Ad-ACE2-transduced mice. Tmprss2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cells, however, such antiviral efficacy was lacking in human lung cells and organoids. Accordingly, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR-independent TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 regulatory locus in human lung cells. Thus, our findings do not support the postulated protective role of enzalutamide in treating COVID-19 through reducing TMPRSS2 expression in lung cells.

A subset of patients with gastric cancer have mutations in genes that participate in or regulate Wnt signaling at the level of ligand (Wnt) receptor (Fzd) binding. Moreover, increased Fzd expression is associated with poor clinical outcome. Despite these findings, there are no in vivo studies investigating the potential of targeting Wnt receptors for treating gastric cancer, and the specific Wnt receptor transmitting oncogenic Wnt signaling in gastric cancer is unknown. Here, we use inhibitors of Wnt/Fzd (OMP-18R5/vantictumab) and conditional gene deletion to test the therapeutic potential of targeting Wnt signaling in preclinical models of intestinal-type gastric cancer and ex vivo organoid cultures. Pharmacologic targeting of Fzd inhibited the growth of gastric adenomas in vivo. We identified Fzd7 to be the predominant Wnt receptor responsible for transmitting Wnt signaling in human gastric cancer cells and mouse models of gastric cancer, whereby Fzd7-deficient cells were retained in gastric adenomas but were unable to respond to Wnt signals and consequently failed to proliferate. Genetic deletion of Fzd7 or treatment with vantictumab was sufficient to inhibit the growth of gastric adenomas with or without mutations to Apc. Vantictumab is currently in phase Ib clinical trials for advanced pancreatic, lung, and breast cancer. Our data extend the scope of patients that may benefit from this therapeutic approach as we demonstrate that this drug will be effective in treating patients with gastric cancer regardless of APC mutation status. SIGNIFICANCE: The Wnt receptor Fzd7 plays an essential role in gastric tumorigenesis irrespective of Apc mutation status, therefore targeting Wnt/Fzd7 may be of therapeutic benefit to patients with gastric cancer.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31485593        	miR‑5191 functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting RPS6KB1 in colorectal cancer.            	MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a class of small non‑coding RNAs that play pivotal roles in cancer physiology as important epigenetic regulators of gene expression. Several miRNAs have been previously discovered that regulate the proliferation of the colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line HCT116. In the present study, one of these miRNAs, miR‑5191, was characterized as a tumor suppressor in CRC cells. Transfection with miR‑5191 led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, invasiveness, tumor sphere‑forming ability and tumor organoid growth, as determined via trypan blue, Transwell, sphere culture and organoid culture assays, respectively. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that miR‑5191 induced the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of CRC cells. Additionally, the expression of miR‑5191 was downregulated in CRC tumor tissues compared with in normal tissues, as measured by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR analysis. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase β1 (RPS6KB1) was identified as a direct target of miR‑5191. Ectopic expression of RPS6KB1 suppressed the function of miR‑5191. Intratumoral injection of miR‑5191 mimic suppressed tumor growth in HCT116 xenografts. These findings suggested a novel tumor‑suppressive function for miR‑5191 in CRC, and its potential applicability for the development of anticancer miRNA therapeutics.	
32550000        	A PROTAC peptide induces durable β-catenin degradation and suppresses Wnt-dependent intestinal cancer.            	Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been associated with the onset and progression of many types of tumors and thus β-catenin represents one attractive intracellular target for cancer therapy. Based on the Axin-derived peptide that binds to β-catenin, two stapled peptides SAHPA1 and xStAx were reported to enhance or impair Wnt/β-catenin signaling, respectively. In this study, we designed PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras) by coupling SAHPA1 or xStAx with the VHL ligand to achieve efficient β-catenin degradation. The obtained xStAx-VHLL sustained β-catenin degradation and manifested strong inhibition of Wnt signaling in cancer cells and in APC                        -/-                     organoids. Furthermore, xStAx-VHLL could effectively restrain tumor formation in BALB/C nude mice, and diminish the existing tumors in APC                        min/+                     mice. More importantly, xStAx-VHLL could potently inhibit the survival of colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids. These findings suggest that xStAx-VHLL exhibits the ability of cancer prevention and cure, highlighting the potential of β-catenin degrader PROTACs as a new class of promising anticancer agent.                © The Author(s) 2020.	
26863187        	Visualization of a short-range Wnt gradient in the intestinal stem-cell niche.            	Mammalian Wnt proteins are believed to act as short-range signals, yet have not been previously visualized in vivo. Self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation are coordinated along a putative Wnt gradient in the intestinal crypt. Wnt3 is produced specifically by Paneth cells. Here we have generated an epitope-tagged, functional Wnt3 knock-in allele. Wnt3 covers basolateral membranes of neighbouring stem cells. In intestinal organoids, Wnt3-transfer involves direct contact between Paneth cells and stem cells. Plasma membrane localization requires surface expression of Frizzled receptors, which in turn is regulated by the transmembrane E3 ligases Rnf43/Znrf3 and their antagonists Lgr4-5/R-spondin. By manipulating Wnt3 secretion and by arresting stem-cell proliferation, we demonstrate that Wnt3 mainly travels away from its source in a cell-bound manner through cell division, and not through diffusion. We conclude that stem-cell membranes constitute a reservoir for Wnt proteins, while Frizzled receptor turnover and 'plasma membrane dilution' through cell division shape the epithelial Wnt3 gradient.	
25810016        	Deptor enhances triple-negative breast cancer metastasis and chemoresistance through coupling to survivin expression.            	Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) functions to suppress tumorigenesis in normal mammary tissues and early-stage breast cancers and, paradoxically, acts to promote the metastasis and chemoresistance in late-stage breast cancers, particularly triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Precisely how TGF-β acquires oncogenic characteristics in late-stage breast cancers remains unknown, as does the role of the endogenous mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, Dep domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (Deptor), in coupling TGF-β to TNBC development and metastatic progression. Here we demonstrate that Deptor expression was downregulated in basal-like/TNBCs relative to their luminal counterparts. Additionally, Deptor expression was 1) inversely correlated with the metastatic ability of human (MCF10A) and mouse (4T1) TNBC progression series and 2) robustly repressed by several inducers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition programs. Functional disruption of Deptor expression in 4T07 cells significantly inhibited their proliferation and organoid growth in vitro, as well as prevented their colonization and tumor formation in the lungs of mice. In stark contrast, elevated Deptor expression was significantly associated with poorer overall survival of patients harboring estrogen receptor α-negative breast cancers. Accordingly, enforced Deptor expression in MDA-MB-231 cells dramatically enhanced their 1) organoid growth in vitro, 2) pulmonary outgrowth in mice, and 3) resistance to chemotherapies, an event dependent on the coupling of Deptor to survivin expression. Collectively, our findings highlight the dichotomous functions of Deptor in modulating the proliferation and survival of TNBCs during metastasis; they also implicate Deptor and its stimulation of survivin as essential components of TNBC resistance to chemotherapies and apoptotic stimuli.

23432616        	Mammary ductal elongation and myoepithelial migration are regulated by the composition of the extracellular matrix.            	Mammary branching morphogenesis occurs over a period of weeks deep inside an adipocyte-rich stroma. The adipocytes contain light-scattering lipid droplets that limit the depth of penetration of visible light. Organotypic culture methods were developed to enable high-resolution optical monitoring of branching morphogenesis ex vivo. A challenge has been to identify the best culture conditions to model specific developmental events. We recently demonstrated that collagen I induces protrusive invasion in both normal and neoplastic mammary epithelium. In this study, we observed that the abundance of collagen I fibrils correlated strongly with invasive behaviour, even when the collagen I concentration was identical. We found that the extent of fibril assembly was experimentally manipulable by varying the incubation time at 4°C following pH neutralization. We next tested the capacity of collagen I fibrils to induce invasive behaviour when presented in combination with basement membrane proteins (Matrigel). We found that epithelial organoids in mixed gels of collagen I and basement membrane proteins exhibited more extensive branching morphogenesis but did not initiate protrusions into the matrix. Organoids in pure Matrigel produced many small epithelial buds that were bare of myoepithelial cells. Surprisingly, organoids in mixed gels of collagen I and Matrigel produced fewer epithelial buds, the buds elongated further, and the elongating buds remained covered by myoepithelial cells. Our mixed gels therefore provide a more physiologically accurate model of mammary branching morphogenesis. Our results also suggest that changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix could induce migration of epithelial cells past myoepithelial coverage.                 © 2013 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2013 Royal Microscopical Society.	
29323154        	Effects of metformin on colorectal cancer stem cells depend on alterations in glutamine metabolism.            	Metformin has been known to suppress cancer stem cells (CSCs) in some cancers. However, the differential effects of metformin on CSCs and their mechanisms have not been reported. Herein, metformin induced pAMPK activation and pS6 suppression in metformin-sensitive (HT29) cells, but not in metformin-resistant (SW620) cells. The oxygen consumption rate was higher in HT29 cells than in SW620 cells and showed a prominent decrease after metformin treatment in HT29 cells. In glutamine-depleted medium, but not in low-glucose medium, SW620 cells became sensitive to the CSC-suppressing effect of metformin. A combination of metformin and glutaminase C inhibitor (compound 968) suppressed CSCs in SW620 cells and enhanced that effect in HT29 cells. SW620 cells showed higher expression of glutaminase 1 and glutamine transporter (ASCT2) than HT29 cells, especially ASCT2 in CSCs. Knockdown of glutaminase 1, ASCT2, and c-Myc induced significant CSC-suppression and enhanced CSC-suppressing effect of metformin and compound 968. In xenografts and human cancer organoids, combined treatment with metformin and compound 968 showed the same results as those shown in vitro. In conclusion, the effect of metformin on CSCs varies depending on the AMPK-mTOR and glutamine metabolism. The inhibition of glutamine pathway could enhance the CSC-suppressing effect of metformin, overcoming metformin resistance.	
32701512        	Pharmacogenomics of aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal breast cancer and additional mechanisms of anastrozole action.            	Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) reduce breast cancer recurrence and prolong survival, but up to 30% of patients exhibit recurrence. Using a genome-wide association study of patients entered on MA.27, a phase III randomized trial of anastrozole versus exemestane, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CUB And Sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) associated with breast cancer-free interval, with the variant allele associated with fewer distant recurrences. Mechanistically, CSMD1 regulates CYP19 expression in an SNP- and drug-dependent fashion, and this regulation is different among 3 AIs: anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole. Overexpression of CSMD1 sensitized AI-resistant cells to anastrozole but not to the other 2 AIs. The SNP in CSMD1 that was associated with increased CSMD1 and CYP19 expression levels increased anastrozole sensitivity, but not letrozole or exemestane sensitivity. Anastrozole degrades estrogen receptor α (ERα), especially in the presence of estradiol (E2). ER+ breast cancer organoids and AI- or fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cells were more sensitive to anastrozole plus E2 than to AI alone. Our findings suggest that the CSMD1 SNP might help to predict AI response, and anastrozole plus E2 serves as a potential new therapeutic strategy for patients with AI- or fulvestrant-resistant breast cancers.	
32086157        	Patient-derived model systems and the development of next-generation anticancer therapeutics.            	Anticancer drug discovery and development using conventional cell line and animal models has traditionally had a low overall success rate. Despite yielding game-changing new therapeutics, 10-20 new molecules have to be brought to the clinic to obtain one new approval, making this approach costly and inefficient. The use of in vitro experimental models based on primary human tumour tissues has the potential to provide a representation of human cancer biology that is closer to an actual patient and to 'bridge the translational gap' between preclinical and clinical research. Here, we review recent advances in the use of human tumour samples for preclinical research through organoid development or as primary patient materials. While challenges still remain regarding analysis, validation and scalability, evidence is mounting for the applicability of both models as preclinical research tools.

24196617        	[Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. Role of biopsies].            	Neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract are heterogeneous regarding etiology (e.g. sporadic or hereditary), histomorphology, hormone expression, hormone-related functional activity and especially the malignant potential. In neuroendocrine neoplasms the biopsy-based diagnosis plays an important role for the clinical management of patients. The diagnosis most importantly relies on the differentiation (e.g. organoid versus diffuse growth patterns) and the grading of tumors. The latter is based on the proliferation activity as determined by Ki-67 immunostaining and mitotic count and results in the current tumor classification into neuroendocrine tumors G1, neuroendocrine tumors G2 or neuroendocrine carcinomas G3. Occasionally, tumors may show mixed differentiation containing a non-neuroendocrine cancer component. The neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and chromogranin A are recommended for the immunohistochemical confirmation of the diagnosis. Furthermore, biopsy material can be used to investigate the expression of therapy-related markers, such as somatostatin receptor-2A. Moreover, if needed, the expression of transcription factors and hormones can be determined to obtain information on the possible site of origin of metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms or to determine the syndrome-inducing hormone in functionally active neuroendocrine neoplasms. Finally, using the stomach as an example, biopsies may also be successfully used to investigate neuroendocrine precursor lesions which may harbor prognostic significance.	
30571086        	A Cancer-Selective Zinc Ionophore Inspired by the Natural Product Naamidine A.            	We present data demonstrating the natural product mimic, zinaamidole A (ZNA), is a modulator of metal ion homeostasis causing cancer-selective cell death by specifically inducing cellular Zn2+-uptake in transformed cells. ZNA's cancer selectivity was evaluated using metastatic, patient-derived breast cancer cells, established human breast cancer cell lines, and three-dimensional organoid models derived from normal and transformed mouse mammary glands. Structural analysis of ZNA demonstrated that the compound interacts with zinc through the N2-acyl-2-aminoimidazole core. Combination treatment with ZnSO4 strongly potentiated ZNA's cancer-specific cell death mechanism, an effect that was not observed with other transition metals. We show that Zn2+-dyshomeostasis induced by ZNA is unique and markedly more selective than other known Zn2+-interacting compounds such as clioquinol. The in vivo bioactivity of ZNA was also assessed and revealed that tumor-bearing mice treated with ZNA had improved survival outcomes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the N2-acyl-2-aminoimidazole core of ZNA represents a powerful chemotype to induce cell death in cancer cells concurrently with a disruption in zinc homeostasis.	
29192179        	CMScaller: an R package for consensus molecular subtyping of colorectal cancer pre-clinical models.            	Colorectal cancers (CRCs) can be divided into four gene expression-based biologically distinct consensus molecular subtypes (CMS). This classification provides a potential framework for stratified treatment, but to identify novel CMS-drug associations, translation of the subtypes to pre-clinical models is essential. The currently available classifier is dependent on gene expression signals from the immune and stromal compartments of tumors and fails to identify the poor-prognostic CMS4-mesenchymal group in immortalized cell lines, patient-derived organoids and xenografts. To address this, we present a novel CMS classifier based on a filtered set of cancer cell-intrinsic, subtype-enriched gene expression markers. This new classifier, referred to as CMScaller, recapitulated the subtypes in both in vitro and in vivo models (551 in total). Importantly, by analyzing public drug response data from patient-derived xenografts and cell lines, we show that the subtypes are predictive of response to standard CRC drugs. CMScaller is available as an R package.	
27099217        	Xenopus: leaping forward in kidney organogenesis.            	While kidney donations stagnate, the number of people in need of kidney transplants continues to grow. Although transplanting culture-grown organs is years away, pursuing the engineering of the kidney de novo is a valid means of closing the gap between the supply and demand of kidneys for transplantation. The structural organization of a mouse kidney is similar to that of humans. Therefore, mice have traditionally served as the primary model system for the study of kidney development. The mouse is an ideal model organism for understanding the complexity of the human kidney. Nonetheless, the elaborate structure of the mammalian kidney makes the discovery of new therapies based on de novo engineered kidneys more challenging. In contrast to mammals, amphibians have a kidney that is anatomically less complex and develops faster. Given that analogous genetic networks regulate the development of mammalian and amphibian nephric organs, using embryonic kidneys of Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) to analyze inductive cell signaling events and morphogenesis has many advantages. Pioneering work that led to the ability to generate kidney organoids from embryonic cells was carried out in Xenopus. In this review, we discuss how Xenopus can be utilized to compliment the work performed in mammalian systems to understand kidney development.	
32023462        	Cell Lineage Tracing Identifies Hormone-Regulated and Wnt-Responsive Vaginal Epithelial Stem Cells.            	The intact vaginal epithelium is essential for women's reproductive health and provides protection against HIV and sexually transmitted infections. How this epithelium maintains itself remains poorly understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to define the diverse cell populations in the vaginal epithelium. We show that vaginal epithelial cell proliferation is limited to the basal compartment without any obvious label-retaining cells. Furthermore, we developed vaginal organoids and show that the basal cells have increased organoid forming efficiency. Importantly, Axin2 marks a self-renewing subpopulation of basal cells that gives rise to differentiated cells over time. These cells are ovariectomy-resistant stem cells as they proliferate even in the absence of hormones. Upon hormone supplementation, these cells expand and reconstitute the entire vaginal epithelium. Wnt/β-catenin is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of vaginal stem cells. Together, these data define heterogeneity in vaginal epithelium and identify vaginal epithelial stem cells.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

29089374        	Autophagy protein ATG16L1 prevents necroptosis in the intestinal epithelium.            	A variant of the autophagy gene ATG16L1 is associated with Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and poor survival in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. We demonstrate that ATG16L1 in the intestinal epithelium is essential for preventing loss of Paneth cells and exaggerated cell death in animal models of virally triggered IBD and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Intestinal organoids lacking ATG16L1 reproduced this loss in Paneth cells and displayed TNFα-mediated necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis. This cytoprotective function of ATG16L1 was associated with the role of autophagy in promoting mitochondrial homeostasis. Finally, therapeutic blockade of necroptosis through TNFα or RIPK1 inhibition ameliorated disease in the virally triggered IBD model. These findings indicate that, in contrast to tumor cells in which autophagy promotes caspase-independent cell death, ATG16L1 maintains the intestinal barrier by inhibiting necroptosis in the epithelium.                © 2017 Matsuzawa-Ishimoto et al.	
29084199        	Class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase controls epithelial integrity through endosomal LKB1 regulation.            	The molecular mechanisms underlying the interdependence between intracellular trafficking and epithelial cell polarity are poorly understood. Here we show that inactivation of class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (CIII-PI3K), which produces phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) on endosomes, disrupts epithelial organization. This is caused by dysregulation of endosomally localized Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1, also known as STK11), which shows delocalized and increased activity accompanied by dysplasia-like growth and invasive behaviour of cells provoked by JNK pathway activation. CIII-PI3K inactivation cooperates with RasV12 to promote tumour growth in vivo in an LKB1-dependent manner. Strikingly, co-depletion of LKB1 reverts these phenotypes and restores epithelial integrity. The endosomal, but not autophagic, function of CIII-PI3K controls polarity. We identify the CIII-PI3K effector, WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing 2 (WDFY2), as an LKB1 regulator in Drosophila tissues and human organoids. Thus, we define a CIII-PI3K-regulated endosomal signalling platform from which LKB1 directs epithelial polarity, the dysregulation of which endows LKB1 with tumour-promoting properties.	
33003476        	Three-Dimensional Culture Systems in Gastric Cancer Research.            	Gastric cancer (GC), which includes cancer of the esophagus, the oesophagogastric junction, and the stomach fundus, is highly deadly with strong regional influence, Asia being the most affected. GC is often detected at late stages, with 30% of metastatic cases at diagnosis. Many authors have devised models to both unravel the mechanisms of GC development and to evaluate candidate therapeutics. Among these models, 2D-cell cultures are progressively replaced by 3D-cell cultures that recapitulate, much more comprehensively, tumor cellular and genetic heterogeneity, as well as responsiveness to environmental changes, such as exposure to drugs or irradiation. With respect to the specifics of GC, there are high hopes from such model systems, especially with the aim of identifying prognostic markers and novel drug targets.	
32508060        	Conditional reprogramming: Modeling urological cancer and translation to clinics.            	Patient-derived models, including cell models (organoids and conditionally reprogrammed cells [CRCs]) and patient-derived xenografts, are urgently needed for both basic and translational cancer research. Conditional reprogramming (CR) technique refers to a co-culture system of primary human normal or tumor cells with irradiated murine fibroblasts in the presence of a Rho-associated kinase inhibitor to allow the primary cells to acquire stem cell properties and the ability to proliferate indefinitely in vitro without any exogenous gene or viral transfection. Considering its robust features, the CR technique may facilitate cancer research in many aspects. Under in vitro culturing, malignant CRCs can share certain genetic aberrations and tumor phenotypes with their parental specimens. Thus, tumor CRCs can promisingly be utilized for the study of cancer biology, the discovery of novel therapies, and the promotion of precision medicine. For normal CRCs, the characteristics of normal karyotype maintenance and lineage commitment suggest their potential in toxicity testing and regenerative medicine. In this review, we discuss the applications, limitations, and future potential of CRCs in modeling urological cancer and translation to clinics.                © 2020 The Authors.

32887686        	Comprehensive analysis of structural variants in breast cancer genomes using single-molecule sequencing.            	Improved identification of structural variants (SVs) in cancer can lead to more targeted and effective treatment options as well as advance our basic understanding of the disease and its progression. We performed whole-genome sequencing of the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line and patient-derived tumor and normal organoids from two breast cancer patients using Illumina/10x Genomics, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. We then inferred SVs and large-scale allele-specific copy number variants (CNVs) using an ensemble of methods. Our findings show that long-read sequencing allows for substantially more accurate and sensitive SV detection, with between 90% and 95% of variants supported by each long-read technology also supported by the other. We also report high accuracy for long reads even at relatively low coverage (25×-30×). Furthermore, we integrated SV and CNV data into a unifying karyotype-graph structure to present a more accurate representation of the mutated cancer genomes. We find hundreds of variants within known cancer-related genes detectable only through long-read sequencing. These findings highlight the need for long-read sequencing of cancer genomes for the precise analysis of their genetic instability.                © 2020 Aganezov et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
29928492        	Liquid biopsy in pancreatic cancer: the beginning of a new era.            	With dismal survival rate pancreatic cancer remains one of the most aggressive and devastating malignancy. Predominantly, due to the absence of a dependable methodology for early identification and limited therapeutic options for advanced disease. However, it takes over 17 years to develop pancreatic cancer from initiation of mutation to metastatic cancer; therefore, if diagnosed early; it may increase overall survival dramatically, thus, providing a window of opportunity for early detection. Recently, genomic expression analysis defined 4 subtypes of pancreatic cancer based on mutated genes. Hence, we need simple and standard, minimally invasive test that can monitor those altered genes or their associated pathways in time for the success of precision medicine, and liquid biopsy seems to be one answer to all these questions. Again, liquid biopsy has an ability to pair with genomic tests. Additionally, liquid biopsy based development of circulating tumor cells derived xenografts, 3D organoids system, real-time monitoring of genetic mutations by circulating tumor DNA and exosome as the targeted drug delivery vehicle holds lots of potential for the treatment and cure of pancreatic cancer. At present, diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is frantically done on the premise of CA19-9 and radiological features only, which doesn't give a picture of genetic mutations and epigenetic alteration involved. In this manner, the current diagnostic paradigm for pancreatic cancer diagnosis experiences low diagnostic accuracy. This review article discusses the current state of liquid biopsy in pancreatic cancer as diagnostic and therapeutic tools and future perspectives of research in the light of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and exosomes.	
30889841        	Changes in Human Foetal Osteoblasts Exposed to the Random Positioning Machine and Bone Construct Tissue Engineering.            	Human cells, when exposed to both real and simulated microgravity (s-µg), form 3D tissue constructs mirroring in vivo architectures (e.g., cartilage, intima constructs, cancer spheroids and others). In this study, we exposed human foetal osteoblast (hFOB 1.19) cells to a Random Positioning Machine (RPM) for 7 days and 14 days, with the purpose of investigating the effects of s-µg on biological processes and to engineer 3D bone constructs. RPM exposure of the hFOB 1.19 cells induces alterations in the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, extra cellular matrix (ECM) and the 3D multicellular spheroid (MCS) formation. In addition, after 7 days, it influences the morphological appearance of these cells, as it forces adherent cells to detach from the surface and assemble into 3D structures. The RPM-exposed hFOB 1.19 cells exhibited a differential gene expression of the following genes: transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1, bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2), SRY-Box 9 (SOX9), actin beta (ACTB), beta tubulin (TUBB), vimentin (VIM), laminin subunit alpha 1 (LAMA1), collagen type 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1), phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and fibronectin 1 (FN1). RPM exposure also induced a significantly altered release of the cytokines and bone biomarkers sclerostin (SOST), osteocalcin (OC), osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor 1 alpha (TNF-1α). After the two-week RPM exposure, the spheroids presented a bone-specific morphology. In conclusion, culturing cells in s-µg under gravitational unloading represents a novel technology for tissue-engineering of bone constructs and it can be used for investigating the mechanisms behind spaceflight-related bone loss as well as bone diseases such as osteonecrosis or bone injuries.	
33297478        	Extracellular Matrix Mechanical Properties and Regulation of the Intestinal Stem Cells: When Mechanics Control Fate.            	Intestinal stem cells (ISC) are crucial players in colon epithelium physiology. The accurate control of their auto-renewal, proliferation and differentiation capacities provides a constant flow of regeneration, maintaining the epithelial intestinal barrier integrity. Under stress conditions, colon epithelium homeostasis in disrupted, evolving towards pathologies such as inflammatory bowel diseases or colorectal cancer. A specific environment, namely the ISC niche constituted by the surrounding mesenchymal stem cells, the factors they secrete and the extracellular matrix (ECM), tightly controls ISC homeostasis. Colon ECM exerts physical constraint on the enclosed stem cells through peculiar topography, stiffness and deformability. However, little is known on the molecular and cellular events involved in ECM regulation of the ISC phenotype and fate. To address this question, combining accurately reproduced colon ECM mechanical parameters to primary ISC cultures such as organoids is an appropriated approach. Here, we review colon ECM physical properties at physiological and pathological states and their bioengineered in vitro reproduction applications to ISC studies.	
32245900        	Dual Targeting of CDK4/6 and BCL2 Pathways Augments Tumor Response in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.            	Although cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors significantly extend tumor response in patients with metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, relapse is almost inevitable. This may, in part, reflect the failure of CDK4/6 inhibitors to induce apoptotic cell death. We therefore evaluated combination therapy with ABT-199 (venetoclax), a potent and selective BCL2 inhibitor.                BCL2 family member expression was assessed following treatment with endocrine therapy and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Functional assays were used to determine the impact of adding ABT-199 to fulvestrant and palbociclib in ER+ breast cancer cell lines, patient-derived organoid (PDO), and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. A syngeneic ER+ mouse mammary tumor model was used to study the effect of combination therapy on the immune system.                Triple therapy was well tolerated and produced a superior and more durable tumor response compared with single or doublet therapy. This was associated with marked apoptosis, including of senescent cells, indicative of senolysis. Unexpectedly, ABT-199 resulted in Rb dephosphorylation and reduced G1-S cyclins, most notably at high doses, thereby intensifying the fulvestrant/palbociclib-induced cell-cycle arrest. Interestingly, a CRISPR/Cas9 screen suggested that ABT-199 could mitigate loss of Rb (and potentially other mechanisms of acquired resistance) to palbociclib. ABT-199 did not abrogate the favorable immunomodulatory effects of palbociclib in a syngeneic ER+ mammary tumor model and extended tumor response when combined with anti-PD1 therapy.                This study illustrates the potential for targeting BCL2 in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors and supports investigation of combination therapy in ER+ breast cancer.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32855097        	Human-Derived Model Systems in Gynecological Cancer Research.            	The human female reproductive tract (FRT) is a complex system that combines series of organs, including ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, vagina, and vulva; each of which possesses unique cellular characteristics and functions. This versatility, in turn, allows for the development of a wide range of epithelial gynecological cancers with distinct features. Thus, reliable model systems are required to better understand the diverse mechanisms involved in the regional pathogenesis of the reproductive tract and improve treatment strategies. Here, we review the current human-derived model systems available to study the multitude of gynecological cancers, including ovarian, endometrial, cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer, and the recent advances in the push towards personalized therapy.

32894216        	Regulation of stem/progenitor cell maintenance by BMP5 in prostate homeostasis and cancer initiation.            	Tissue homeostasis relies on the fine regulation between stem and progenitor cell maintenance and lineage commitment. In the adult prostate, stem cells have been identified in both basal and luminal cell compartments. However, basal stem/progenitor cell homeostasis is still poorly understood. We show that basal stem/progenitor cell maintenance is regulated by a balance between BMP5 self-renewal signal and GATA3 dampening activity. Deleting Gata3 enhances adult prostate stem/progenitor cells self-renewal capacity in both organoid and allograft assays. This phenotype results from a local increase in BMP5 activity in basal cells as shown by the impaired self-renewal capacity of Bmp5-deficient stem/progenitor cells. Strikingly, Bmp5 gene inactivation or BMP signaling inhibition with a small molecule inhibitor are also sufficient to delay prostate and skin cancer initiation of Pten-deficient mice. Together, these results establish BMP5 as a key regulator of basal prostate stem cell homeostasis and identifies a potential therapeutic approach against Pten-deficient cancers.                © 2020, Tremblay et al.

25706628        	Stromal gene expression defines poor-prognosis subtypes in colorectal cancer.            	Recent molecular classifications of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on global gene expression profiles have defined subtypes displaying resistance to therapy and poor prognosis. Upon evaluation of these classification systems, we discovered that their predictive power arises from genes expressed by stromal cells rather than epithelial tumor cells. Bioinformatic and immunohistochemical analyses identify stromal markers that associate robustly with disease relapse across the various classifications. Functional studies indicate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) increase the frequency of tumor-initiating cells, an effect that is dramatically enhanced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling. Likewise, we find that all poor-prognosis CRC subtypes share a gene program induced by TGF-β in tumor stromal cells. Using patient-derived tumor organoids and xenografts, we show that the use of TGF-β signaling inhibitors to block the cross-talk between cancer cells and the microenvironment halts disease progression.

32522347        	Experimental investigations of carcinogen-induced mutation spectra: Innovation, challenges and future directions.            	Recent years have witnessed an expansion of mutagenesis research focusing on experimentally modeled genome-scale mutational signatures of carcinogens and of endogenous processes. Experimental mutational signatures can explain etiologic links to patterns found in human tumors that may be linked to same exposures, and can serve as biomarkers of exposure history and may even provide insights on causality. A number of innovative exposure models have been employed and reported, based on cells cultured in monolayers or in 3-D, on organoids, induced pluripotent stem cells, non-mammalian organisms, microorganisms and rodent bioassays. Here we discuss some of the latest developments and pros and cons of these experimental systems used in mutational signature analysis. Integrative designs that bring together multiple exposure systems (in vitro, in vivo and in silico pan-cancer data mining) started emerging as powerful tools to identify robust mutational signatures of the tested cancer risk agents. We further propose that devising a new generation of cell-based models is warranted to streamline systematic testing of carcinogen effects on the cell genomes, while seeking to increasingly supplant animal with non-animal systems to address relevant ethical issues and accentuate the 3R principles. We conclude that the knowledge accumulating from the growing body of signature modelling investigations has considerable power to advance cancer etiology studies and to support cancer prevention efforts through streamlined characterization of cancer-causing agents and the recognition of their specific effects.

32724460        	Mcl-1 inhibition overcomes intrinsic and acquired regorafenib resistance in colorectal cancer.            	Intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies is a significant clinical problem in cancer. We previously showed that resistance to regorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor for treating colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, can be caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor FBW7, which block degradation of the pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. We tested if Mcl-1 inhibition can be used to develop a precision combination therapy for overcoming regorafenib resistance.                Small-molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors were tested on CRC cells with knock-in (KI) of a non-degradable Mcl-1. Effects of Mcl-1 inhibitors on regorafenib sensitivity were determined in FBW7-mutant and -wild-type (WT) CRC cells and tumors, and in those with acquired regorafenib resistance due to enriched FBW7 mutations. Furthermore, translational potential was explored by establishing and analyzing FBW7-mutant and -WT patient-derived organoid (PDO) and xenograft (PDX) tumor models.                We found that highly potent and specific Mcl-1 inhibitors such as S63845 overcame regorafenib resistance by restoring apoptosis in multiple regorafenib-resistant CRC models. Mcl-1 inhibition re-sensitized CRC tumors with intrinsic and acquired regorafenib resistance in vitro and in vivo, including those with FBW7 mutations. Importantly, Mcl-1 inhibition also sensitized FBW7-mutant PDO and PDX models to regorafenib. In contrast, Mcl-1 inhibition had no effect in FBW7-WT CRCs.                Our results demonstrate that Mcl-1 inhibitors can overcome intrinsic and acquired regorafenib resistance in CRCs by restoring apoptotic response. FBW7 mutations might be a potential biomarker predicting for response to the regorafenib/Mcl-1 inhibitor combination.                © The author(s).	
25712196        	Germline deletions in the tumour suppressor gene FOCAD are associated with polyposis and colorectal cancer development.            	Heritable genetic variants can significantly affect the lifetime risk of developing cancer, including polyposis and colorectal cancer (CRC). Variants in genes currently known to be associated with a high risk for polyposis or CRC, however, explain only a limited number of hereditary cases. The identification of additional genetic causes is, therefore, crucial to improve CRC prevention, detection and treatment. We have performed genome-wide and targeted DNA copy number profiling and resequencing in early-onset and familial polyposis/CRC patients, and show that deletions affecting the open reading frame of the tumour suppressor gene FOCAD are recurrent and significantly enriched in CRC patients compared with unaffected controls. All patients carrying FOCAD deletions exhibited a personal or family history of polyposis. RNA in situ hybridization revealed FOCAD expression in epithelial cells in the colonic crypt, the site of tumour initiation, as well as in colonic tumours and organoids. Our data suggest that monoallelic germline deletions in the tumour suppressor gene FOCAD underlie moderate genetic predisposition to the development of polyposis and CRC.                © 2015 Authors.

33001511        	LGR5 constitutively activates NF-κB signaling to regulate the growth of intestinal crypts.            	Mammalian LGR5 and LGR4, markers of adult stem cells, are involved in many physiological functions by enhancing WNT signaling. However, whether LGR5 and LGR4 are coupled to other intracellular signaling pathways to regulate stem cell function remains unknown. Here, we show that LGR5 and LGR4 can constitutively activate NF-κB signaling in a ligand-independent manner, which is dependent on their C-termini, but independent of receptor endocytosis. Moreover, the C-termini of LGR5/4 interact with TROY, which is required for activating NF-κB signaling. In small intestinal crypt organoids, overexpression of a C-terminal deletion mutant of LGR5 inhibits the growth and bud formation of organoids, whereas overexpression of the R-spondin-binding mutant of LGR5 that is defective for WNT signaling can still promote organoid growth. Our study reveals that NF-κB signaling, regulated by LGR5 and LGR4, plays an important role in the survival of colon cancer cells and the growth of intestinal crypts. Our findings also suggest that LGR5/4-induced NF-κB signaling and WNT signaling may co-regulate the growth of LGR5+ adult stem cells and intestinal crypts.                © 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.	
23680148        	Mutant p53 prolongs NF-κB activation and promotes chronic inflammation and inflammation-associated colorectal cancer.            	The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently mutated in human cancer. Common mutant p53 (mutp53) isoforms can actively promote cancer through gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms. We report that mutp53 prolongs TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in cultured cells and intestinal organoid cultures. Remarkably, when exposed to dextran sulfate sodium, mice harboring a germline p53 mutation develop severe chronic inflammation and persistent tissue damage, and are highly prone to inflammation-associated colon cancer. This mutp53 GOF is manifested by rapid onset of flat dysplastic lesions that progress to invasive carcinoma with mutp53 accumulation and augmented NF-κB activation, faithfully recapitulating features frequently observed in human colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). These findings might explain the early appearance of p53 mutations in human CAC.                Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33304752        	Enhanced Protein Damage Clearance Induces Broad Drug Resistance in Multitype of Cancers Revealed by an Evolution Drug-Resistant Model and Genome-Wide siRNA Screening.            	Resistance to therapeutic drugs occurs in virtually all types of cancers, and the tolerance to one drug frequently becomes broad therapy resistance; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Combining a whole whole-genome-wide RNA interference screening and an evolutionary drug pressure model with MDA-MB-231 cells, it is found that enhanced protein damage clearance and reduced mitochondrial respiratory activity are responsible for cisplatin resistance. Screening drug-resistant cancer cells and human patient-derived organoids for breast and colon cancers with many anticancer drugs indicates that activation of mitochondrion protein import surveillance system enhances proteasome activity and minimizes caspase activation, leading to broad drug resistance that can be overcome by co-treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. It is further demonstrated that cisplatin and bortezomib encapsulated into nanoparticle further enhance their therapeutic efficacy and alleviate side effects induced by drug combination treatment. These data demonstrate a feasibility for eliminating broad drug resistance by targeting its common mechanism to achieve effective therapy for multiple cancers.                © 2020 The Authors.

33654823        	Photodynamic Therapy in a 3D Model of Ovarian Cancer.            	Photodynamic therapy (PDT), is a clinically-approved light-based anti-cancer treatment modality in which a photoactivatable photosensitizer is irradiated with an appropriate wavelength of light to generate cytotoxic molecules to kill cancer cells. In this article, we describe an in vitro PDT protocol using a 3-dimensional (3D) model of ovarian cancer that was established on beds of Matrigel. PDT was performed using a liposomal formulation of verteporfin photosensitizer (Visudyne®). The cancer cells were genetically-labeled with the fluorescent protein mCherry to facilitate the evaluation of the treatment response. This protocol is advantageous because the mCherry fluorescence is an indicator of cell viability, eliminating the need for external dyes, which often exhibit limited penetration and diffusion into 3D organoids. Additionally, Visudyne PDT achieves significant tumor-killing efficacy in a 3D model for ovarian cancer.                Copyright © 2019 The Authors; exclusive licensee Bio-protocol LLC.	
33545223        	Inhibition of DHFR targets the self-renewing potential of brain tumor initiating cells.            	Brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of benign and malignant tumors arising from the brain parenchyma and its surrounding structures, with in general a poor clinical outcome due to high recurrence. One of the underlying causes for this somber prognostic is the presence of brain tumor initiating cells (BTIC) endowed with self-renewal potential, multi-lineage differentiation and resistance to treatment. One promising therapeutic avenue for brain tumors is targeting BTIC self-renewal potential and forcing their differentiation. A compelling candidate is one-carbon metabolism shown to play a key role in maintaining stem cell self-renewal in several lineages. Here, we focus on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in one-carbon metabolism, and demonstrate this enzyme's overexpression in several human brain tumors and its expression in human BTIC. We show that DHFR inhibition, either by Methotrexate (MTX) or EphB activation with synthetic ligands, reduces the tumorigenic potential of 4 human BTIC lines, by reducing their self-renewal capacities both in vitro and in a cerebral organoid glioma (GLICO) model. Our data indicate that driving BTIC differentiation by inhibiting DHFR may provide a new therapeutic approach to treating highly refractory aggressive tumors.

33635003        	Understanding cell-cell communication and signaling in the colorectal cancer microenvironment.            	Carcinomas are complex heterocellular systems containing epithelial cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts, and multiple immune cell-types. Cell-cell communication between these tumor microenvironments (TME) and cells drives cancer progression and influences response to existing therapies. In order to provide better treatments for patients, we must understand how various cell-types collaborate within the TME to drive cancer and consider the multiple signals present between and within different cancer types. To investigate how tissues function, we need a model to measure both how signals are transferred between cells and how that information is processed within cells. The interplay of collaboration between different cell-types requires cell-cell communication. This article aims to review the current in vitro and in vivo mono-cellular and multi-cellular cultures models of colorectal cancer (CRC), and to explore how they can be used for single-cell multi-omics approaches for isolating multiple types of molecules from a single-cell required for cell-cell communication to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. Integrating the existing single-cell signaling measurements and models, and through understanding the cell identity and how different cell types communicate, will help predict drug sensitivities in tumor cells and between- and within-patients responses.                © 2021 The Authors.

33177991        	Engineering Three-Dimensional Tumor Models to Study Glioma Cancer Stem Cells and Tumor Microenvironment.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and devastating primary brain tumor, leading to a uniform fatality after diagnosis. A major difficulty in eradicating GBM is the presence of microscopic residual infiltrating disease remaining after multimodality treatment. Glioma cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been pinpointed as the treatment-resistant tumor component that seeds ultimate tumor progression. Despite the key role of CSCs, the ideal preclinical model to study the genetic and epigenetic landmarks driving their malignant behavior while simulating an accurate interaction with the tumor microenvironment (TME) is still missing. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) tumor platforms, such as organoids and 3D bioprinting, has allowed for a better representation of the pathophysiologic interactions between glioma CSCs and the TME. Thus, these technologies have enabled a more detailed study of glioma biology, tumor angiogenesis, treatment resistance, and even performing high-throughput screening assays of drug susceptibility. First, we will review the foundation of glioma biology and biomechanics of the TME, and then the most up-to-date insights about the applicability of these new tools in malignant glioma research.

30168144        	Three types of metaplasia model through Kras activation, Pten deletion, or Cdh1 deletion in the gastric epithelium.            	Chronic inflammation and intestinal metaplasia are strongly associated with gastric carcinogenesis. Kras activation and Pten deletion are observed in intestinal-type gastric cancer, and Cdh1 mutation is associated with diffuse-type gastric cancer. Although various mouse models of gastric carcinogenesis have been reported, few mouse lines enable gene manipulation selectively in the stomach. Here we established a Tff1-Cre bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse line in an attempt to induce gene modification specifically in the gastric pit lineage. In the stomach, Tff1-Cre-mediated recombination was most evident in the pit lineage in the corpus and in entire antral glands; recombination was also observed in a few gastric chief and parietal cells. Outside the stomach, recombination was patchy throughout the intestines, and particularly frequently in the duodenum (Brunner glands), cecum, and proximal colon. In the stomachs of Tff1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D mice, proliferating cell clusters expanded throughout the corpus glands, with foveolar cell expansion with ectopic Alcian blue-positive mucins, oxyntic atrophy, and pseudopyloric changes with spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia; however, gastric cancer was not observed even at 12 months of age. Corpus-derived organoids from Tff1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D mice exhibited accelerated growth and abnormal differentiation with a loss of chief and parietal cell markers. Tff1-Cre;Ptenflox/flox mice displayed similar changes to those seen in Tff1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D mice, both with aberrant ERK activation within 3 months. In contrast, Tff1-Cre;Cdh1flox/flox mice initially showed signet ring-like cells that were rapidly lost with disruption of the mucosal surface, and later developed gastric epithelial shedding with hyperproliferation and loss of normal gastric lineages. Eventually, the glandular epithelium in Tff1-Cre;Cdh1flox/flox mice was completely replaced by squamous epithelium which expanded from the forestomach. Tff1-Cre mice offer an additional useful tool for studying gastric carcinogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Copyright © 2018 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

32656088        	Dual-mTOR Inhibitor Rapalink-1 Reduces Prostate Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft Growth and Alters Tumor Heterogeneity.            	Bone metastasis is the leading cause of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality, frequently marking the progression to castration-resistant PCa. Dysregulation of the androgen receptor pathway is a common feature of castration-resistant PCa, frequently appearing in association with mTOR pathway deregulations. Advanced PCa is also characterized by increased tumor heterogeneity and cancer stem cell (CSC) frequency. CSC-targeted therapy is currently being explored in advanced PCa, with the aim of reducing cancer clonal divergence and preventing disease progression. In this study, we compared the molecular pathways enriched in a set of bone metastasis from breast and prostate cancer from snap-frozen tissue. To further model PCa drug resistance mechanisms, we used two patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models of bone-metastatic PCa, BM18, and LAPC9. We developed in vitro organoids assay and ex vivo tumor slice drug assays to investigate the effects of mTOR- and CSC-targeting compounds. We found that both PDXs could be effectively targeted by treatment with the bivalent mTORC1/2 inhibitor Rapalink-1. Exposure of LAPC9 to Rapalink-1 but not to the CSC-targeting drug disulfiram blocked mTORC1/2 signaling, diminished expression of metabolic enzymes involved in glutamine and lipid metabolism and reduced the fraction of CD44+ and ALDEFluorhigh cells, in vitro. Mice treated with Rapalink-1 showed a significantly delayed tumor growth compared to control and cells recovered from the tumors of treated animals showed a marked decrease of CD44 expression. Taken together these results highlight the increased dependence of advanced PCa on the mTOR pathway, supporting the development of a targeted approach for advanced, bone metastatic PCa.

28439013        	Biliary epithelial injury-induced regenerative response by IL-33 promotes cholangiocarcinogenesis from peribiliary glands.            	The carcinogenic mechanism of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) is unclear, due at least in part to the lack of an appropriate mouse model. Because human studies have reported frequent genetic alterations in the Ras- and TGFβ/SMAD-signaling pathways in ECC, mice with tamoxifen-inducible, duct-cell-specific Kras activation and a TGFβ receptor type 2 (TGFβR2) deletion were first generated by crossing LSL-Kras                        G12D                     , Tgfbr2                        flox/flox                     , and K19                        CreERT                     mice (KT-K19                        CreERT                     ). However, KT-K19                        CreERT                     mice showed only mild hyperplasia of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) in the extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD) and died within 7 wk, probably a result of lung adenocarcinomas. Next, to analyze the additional effect of E-cadherin loss, KT-K19                        CreERT                     mice were crossed with CDH1                        flox/flox                     mice (KTC-K19                        CreERT                     ). Surprisingly, KTC-K19                        CreERT                     mice exhibited a markedly thickened EHBD wall accompanied by a swollen gallbladder within 4 wk after tamoxifen administration. Histologically, invasive periductal infiltrating-type ECC with lymphatic metastasis was observed. Time-course analysis of EHBD revealed that recombined BECs lining the bile duct lumen detached due to E-cadherin loss, whereas recombined cells could survive in the peribiliary glands (PBGs), which are considered a BEC stem-cell niche. Detached dying BECs released high levels of IL-33, as determined by microarray analysis using biliary organoids, and stimulated inflammation and a regenerative response by PBGs, leading eventually to ECC development. Cell lineage tracing suggested PBGs as the cellular origin of ECC. IL-33 cooperated with Kras and TGFβR2 mutations in the development of ECC, and anti-IL-33 treatment suppressed ECC development significantly. Thus, this mouse model provided insight into the carcinogenic mechanisms, cellular origin, and potential therapeutic targets of ECC.	
30965636        	A Therapeutic Strategy for Chemotherapy-Resistant Gastric Cancer via Destabilization of Both β-Catenin and RAS.            	: Treatment of advanced gastric cancer patients with current standard chemotherapeutic agents frequently results in resistance, leading to poor overall survival. However, there has been no success in developing strategies to overcome it. We showed the expression levels of both β-catenin and RAS were significantly increased and correlated in tissues of 756 gastric cancer (GC) patients and tissues of primary- and acquired-resistance patient-derived xenograft tumors treated with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin modulated with leucovorin (FOLFOX). On the basis of our previous studies, where small molecules to suppress colorectal cancer (CRC) via degrading both β-catenin and RAS were developed, we tested the effectiveness of KYA1797K, a representative compound functioning by binding axin, in the growth of GC cells. The efficacy test of the drugs using gastric tumor organoids of Apc1638N mice showed that the CD44 and ALDH1A3 cancer stem cell markers were induced by FOLFOX, but not by KYA1797K. KYA1797K also efficiently suppressed tumors generated by re-engrafting the FOLFOX-resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, which also showed resistance to paclitaxel. Overall, the small-molecule approach degrading both β-catenin and RAS has potential as a therapeutic strategy for treating GC patients resistant to current standard chemotherapies.	
31842288        	5-Fluorouracil as a Tumor-Treating Field-Sensitizer in Colon Cancer Therapy.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of mortality that can be treated effectively with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, although resistance to these therapeutic modalities often occurs. Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) can block tumor growth by selectively impairing tumor cell division. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) sensitizes tumor cells to TTFields. Human HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells were treated with 5-FU and/or TTFields, and characterized in vitro in terms of cell viability, apoptosis through reactive oxygen species production, autophagy, and metastatic potentials. The biological effects of 5-FU and/or TTFields were studied via positron emission tomography and computed tomography on xenograft tumor growth and were confirmed with organoid models of patients. Our results revealed that combination treatment with 5-FU and TTFields increased the efficiency of TTFields therapy in colon cancer cells by downregulating signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation, survival, cell invasion, and migration while upregulating pathways mediating apoptosis and autophagic cell death. The novel mechanistic insights gleaned in this study suggest that combination therapy with TTFields and 5-FU may be effective in treating CRC, although safety and efficacy testing in patients with CRC will need to be performed before this strategy can be implemented clinically for TTF-sensitization.	
32913185        	Upregulation of CPT1A is essential for the tumor-promoting effect of adipocytes in colon cancer.            	Colon tumors grow in an adipose tissue-enriched microenvironment. Locally advanced colon cancers often invade into surrounding adipose tissue with a direct contact with adipocytes. We have previously shown that adipocytes promote tumor growth by modulating cellular metabolism. Here we demonstrate that carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1A), a key enzyme controlling fatty acid oxidation (FAO), was upregulated in colon cancer cells upon exposure to adipocytes or fatty acids. In addition, CPT1A expression was increased in invasive tumor cells within the adipose tissue compared to tumors without direct contact with adipocytes. Silencing CPT1A abolished the protective effect provided by fatty acids against nutrient deprivation and reduced tumor organoid formation in 3D culture and the expression of genes associated with cancer stem cells downstream of Wnt/β-catenin. Mechanistically, CPT1A-dependent FAO promoted the acetylation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Furthermore, knockdown of CPT1A blocked the tumor-promoting effect of adipocytes in vivo and inhibited xenograft tumor initiation. Taken together, our findings identify CPT1A-depedent FAO as an essential metabolic pathway that enables the interaction between adipocytes and colon cancer cells.	
32428886        	Use of inkjet-printed single cells to quantify intratumoral heterogeneity.            	Quantification of intratumoral heterogeneity is essential for designing effective therapeutic strategies in the age of personalized medicine. In this study, we used a piezoelectric inkjet printer to enable analysis of intratumoral heterogeneity in a bladder cancer for the first time. Patient-derived tumor organoids were dissociated into single cell suspension and used as a bioink. The individual cells were precisely allocated into a microwell plate by drop-on-demand inkjet printing without any additive or treatment, followed by culturing into organoids for further analysis. The sizes and morphologies of the organoids were observed, so as the expression of proliferation and apoptotic markers. The tumor organoids also showed heterogeneous responses against chemotherapeutic agent. Further, we quantified mRNA expression levels of representative luminal and basal genes in both type of tumor organoids. These results verify the heterogeneous expression of various genes among individual organoids. This study demonstrates that the fully automated inkjet printing technique can be used as an effective tool to sort cells for evaluating intratumoral heterogeneity.	
30590093        	From pluripotent stem cells to T cells.            	The generation of T cells from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) opens a valuable experimental window into developmental hematopoiesis and raises the possibility of a new therapeutic approach for T-cell immunotherapy. After directing PSCs through mesoderm and early hematopoietic developmental stages, commitment to the T-cell lineage has been achieved by several groups using coculture with stromal cells that express a notch ligand, recapitulating the critical signals that initiate the first stages of normal T-cell differentiation in the thymus. However, positive selection and the production of mature T cells from human PSCs have been limited to date. Nonetheless, T-lineage cells have been generated from PSCs with tumor antigen specificity either through a prearranged clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) or lentiviral-mediated expression of chimeric antigen receptors. The recent development of a 3D artificial organoid model has demonstrated that PSCs can generate mature conventional T cells that are fully functional and express a diverse TCR repertoire. Introduction of a transgenic TCR at the PSC stage allows for the production of tumor-antigen-specific, mature conventional T cells. The tools of gene editing in PSCs are ideally suited to produce off-the-shelf universal products for T-cell immunotherapy. In this review, we describe the studies that have led to this exciting moment in PSC biology and discuss translation to clinical applications.

30200414        	Wnt Effector TCF4 Is Dispensable for Wnt Signaling in Human Cancer Cells.            	T-cell factor 4 (TCF4), together with β-catenin coactivator, functions as the major transcriptional mediator of the canonical wingless/integrated (Wnt) signaling pathway in the intestinal epithelium. The pathway activity is essential for both intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis. To date, several mouse models and cellular systems have been used to analyze TCF4 function. However, some findings were conflicting, especially those that were related to the defects observed in the mouse gastrointestinal tract after Tcf4 gene deletion, or to a potential tumor suppressive role of the gene in intestinal cancer cells or tumors. Here, we present the results obtained using a newly generated conditional Tcf4 allele that allows inactivation of all potential Tcf4 isoforms in the mouse tissue or small intestinal and colon organoids. We also employed the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to disrupt the TCF4 gene in human cells. We showed that in adult mice, epithelial expression of Tcf4 is indispensable for cell proliferation and tumor initiation. However, in human cells, the TCF4 role is redundant with the related T-cell factor 1 (TCF1) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) transcription factors.	
31980446        	MiR130b from Schlafen4+ MDSCs stimulates epithelial proliferation and correlates with preneoplastic changes prior to gastric cancer.            	The myeloid differentiation factor Schlafen4 (Slfn4) marks a subset of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the stomach during Helicobacter-induced spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM).                To identify the gene products expressed by Slfn4+-MDSCs and to determine how they promote SPEM.                We performed transcriptome analyses for both coding genes (mRNA by RNA-Seq) and non-coding genes (microRNAs using NanoString nCounter) using flow-sorted SLFN4+ and SLFN4- cells from Helicobacter-infected mice exhibiting metaplasia at 6 months postinfection. Thioglycollate-elicited myeloid cells from the peritoneum were cultured and treated with IFNα to induce the T cell suppressor phenotype, expression of MIR130b and SLFN4. MIR130b expression in human gastric tissue including gastric cancer and patient sera was determined by qPCR and in situ hybridisation. Knockdown of MiR130b in vivo in Helicobacter-infected mice was performed using Invivofectamine. Organoids from primary gastric cancers were used to generate xenografts. ChIP assay and Western blots were performed to demonstrate NFκb p65 activation by MIR130b.                MicroRNA analysis identified an increase in MiR130b in gastric SLFN4+ cells. Moreover, MIR130b colocalised with SLFN12L, a human homologue of SLFN4, in gastric cancers. MiR130b was required for the T-cell suppressor phenotype exhibited by the SLFN4+ cells and promoted Helicobacter-induced metaplasia. Treating gastric organoids with the MIR130b mimic induced epithelial cell proliferation and promoted xenograft tumour growth.                Taken together, MiR130b plays an essential role in MDSC function and supports metaplastic transformation.                © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

30273559        	Epithelial RNase H2 Maintains Genome Integrity and Prevents Intestinal Tumorigenesis in Mice.            	RNase H2 is a holoenzyme, composed of 3 subunits (ribonuclease H2 subunits A, B, and C), that cleaves RNA:DNA hybrids and removes mis-incorporated ribonucleotides from genomic DNA through ribonucleotide excision repair. Ribonucleotide incorporation by eukaryotic DNA polymerases occurs during every round of genome duplication and produces the most frequent type of naturally occurring DNA lesion. We investigated whether intestinal epithelial proliferation requires RNase H2 function and whether RNase H2 activity is disrupted during intestinal carcinogenesis.                We generated mice with epithelial-specific deletion of ribonuclease H2 subunit B (H2bΔIEC) and mice that also had deletion of tumor-suppressor protein p53 (H2b/p53ΔIEC); we compared phenotypes with those of littermate H2bfl/fl or H2b/p53fl/fl (control) mice at young and old ages. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by histology. We isolated epithelial cells, generated intestinal organoids, and performed RNA sequence analyses. Mutation signatures of spontaneous tumors from H2b/p53ΔIEC mice were characterized by exome sequencing. We collected colorectal tumor specimens from 467 patients, measured levels of ribonuclease H2 subunit B, and associated these with patient survival times and transcriptome data.                The H2bΔIEC mice had DNA damage to intestinal epithelial cells and proliferative exhaustion of the intestinal stem cell compartment compared with controls and H2b/p53ΔIEC mice. However, H2b/p53ΔIEC mice spontaneously developed small intestine and colon carcinomas. DNA from these tumors contained T>G base substitutions at GTG trinucleotides. Analyses of transcriptomes of human colorectal tumors associated lower levels of RNase H2 with shorter survival times.                In analyses of mice with disruption of the ribonuclease H2 subunit B gene and colorectal tumors from patients, we provide evidence that RNase H2 functions as a colorectal tumor suppressor. H2b/p53ΔIEC mice can be used to study the roles of RNase H2 in tissue-specific carcinogenesis.                Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
33422950        	Advances in colon cancer research: in vitro and animal models.            	Modelling human colon cancer has long been the ambition of researchers and oncologists with the aim to better replicate disease progression and treatment response. Advances in our understanding of genetics, stem cell biology, tumour microenvironment and immunology have prepared the groundwork for recent major advances. In the last two years the field has seen the progression of: using patient derived organoids (alone and in co-culture) as predictors of treatment response; molecular stratification of tumours that predict outcome and treatment response; mouse models of metastatic disease; and transplant models that can be used to de-risk clinical trials. We will discuss these advances in this review.                Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	
33414378        	Reprogramming immunosuppressive myeloid cells by activated T cells promotes the response to anti-PD-1 therapy in colorectal cancer.            	Overcoming local immunosuppression is critical for immunotherapy to produce robust anti-tumor responses. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are key regulators of immunosuppressive networks and promote tumor progression. However, it remains unclear whether and how tumor-infiltrating MDSCs are shaped in response to anti-PD-1 treatment and what their impact on therapeutic efficacy is in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, the levels of infiltrating MDSCs were significantly higher in the non-responding organoids and were selectively reduced in the responding group, with MDSCs showing increased apoptosis and attenuated functional activity after anti-PD-1 treatment. A negative correlation between T-cell activation and MDSC function was also observed in fresh human CRC tissues. Mechanistic studies revealed that autocrine IFN-α/β upregulated TRAIL expression on activated T cells to elicit MDSC apoptosis via the TRAIL-DR5 interaction and acted synergistically with TNF-α to inhibit MDSC function of suppressing the T-cell response through the JNK-NMDAR-ARG-1 pathway. Moreover, blockade of IFN-α/β and TNF-α abolished the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment by preserving the frequency and suppressive activity of infiltrating MDSCs in a CRC mouse model. This result suggested that reprogramming MDSCs by IFN-α/β and TNF-α from activated T cells was necessary for successful anti-PD-1 treatment and might serve as a novel strategy to improve the response and efficacy of anticancer therapy.	
25687406        	Suppressing TGFβ signaling in regenerating epithelia in an inflammatory microenvironment is sufficient to cause invasive intestinal cancer.            	Genetic alterations in the TGFβ signaling pathway in combination with oncogenic alterations lead to cancer development in the intestines. However, the mechanisms of TGFβ signaling suppression in malignant progression of intestinal tumors have not yet been fully understood. We have examined Apc(Δ716) Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) compound mutant mice that carry mutations in Apc and Tgfbr2 genes in the intestinal epithelial cells. We found inflammatory microenvironment only in the invasive intestinal adenocarcinomas but not in noninvasive benign polyps of the same mice. We thus treated simple Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) that causes ulcerative colitis. Importantly, these Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) mice developed invasive colon cancer associated with chronic inflammation. We also found that TGFβ signaling is suppressed in human colitis-associated colon cancer cells. In the mouse invasive tumors, macrophages infiltrated and expressed MT1-MMP, causing MMP2 activation. These results suggest that inflammatory microenvironment contributes to submucosal invasion of TGFβ signaling-repressed epithelial cells through activation of MMP2. We further found that regeneration was impaired in Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) mice for intestinal mucosa damaged by DSS treatment or X-ray irradiation, resulting in the expansion of undifferentiated epithelial cell population. Moreover, organoids of intestinal epithelial cells cultured from irradiated Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) mice formed "long crypts" in Matrigel, suggesting acquisition of an invasive phenotype into the extracellular matrix. These results, taken together, indicate that a simple genetic alteration in the TGFβ signaling pathway in the inflamed and regenerating intestinal mucosa can cause invasive intestinal tumors. Such a mechanism may play a role in the colon carcinogenesis associated with inflammatory bowel disease in humans.                ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.	
33042756        	Screening Cancer Immunotherapy: When Engineering Approaches Meet Artificial Intelligence.            	Immunotherapy is a class of promising anticancer treatments that has recently gained attention due to surging numbers of FDA approvals and extensive preclinical studies demonstrating efficacy. Nevertheless, further clinical implementation has been limited by high variability in patient response to different immunotherapeutic agents. These treatments currently do not have reliable predictors of efficacy and may lead to side effects. The future development of additional immunotherapy options and the prediction of patient-specific response to treatment require advanced screening platforms associated with accurate and rapid data interpretation. Advanced engineering approaches ranging from sequencing and gene editing, to tumor organoids engineering, bioprinted tissues, and organs-on-a-chip systems facilitate the screening of cancer immunotherapies by recreating the intrinsic and extrinsic features of a tumor and its microenvironment. High-throughput platform development and progress in artificial intelligence can also improve the efficiency and accuracy of screening methods. Here, these engineering approaches in screening cancer immunotherapies are highlighted, and a discussion of the future perspectives and challenges associated with these emerging fields to further advance the clinical use of state-of-the-art cancer immunotherapies are provided.                © 2020 The Authors.

28100467        	An essential role of CBL and CBL-B ubiquitin ligases in mammary stem cell maintenance.            	The ubiquitin ligases CBL and CBL-B are negative regulators of tyrosine kinase signaling with established roles in the immune system. However, their physiological roles in epithelial tissues are unknown. Here, we used MMTV-Cre-mediated Cbl gene deletion on a Cbl-b null background, as well as a tamoxifen-inducible mammary stem cell (MaSC)-specific Cbl and Cbl-b double knockout (Cbl/Cbl-b DKO) using Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2, to demonstrate a mammary epithelial cell-autonomous requirement of CBL and CBL-B in the maintenance of MaSCs. Using a newly engineered tamoxifen-inducible Cbl and Cbl-b deletion model with a dual fluorescent reporter (Cblflox/flox; Cbl-bflox/flox; Rosa26-CreERT; mT/mG), we show that Cbl/Cbl-b DKO in mammary organoids leads to hyperactivation of AKT-mTOR signaling with depletion of MaSCs. Chemical inhibition of AKT or mTOR rescued MaSCs from Cbl/Cbl-b DKO-induced depletion. Our studies reveal a novel, cell-autonomous requirement of CBL and CBL-B in epithelial stem cell maintenance during organ development and remodeling through modulation of mTOR signaling.                © 2017.

28720124        	Defining the role of Lgr5+ stem cells in colorectal cancer: from basic research to clinical applications.            	Intestinal epithelium is structured by two distinct components: the villi and the crypts. The crypts harbor stem cells expressing Lgr5 and thus have been a representative model to study tissue stem cell functions. Recent advances in organoid technology and analytical modalities have enabled precise characterization of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells, providing insights into their roles in homeostasis and cancer.	
25418719        	ID1 is a functional marker for intestinal stem and progenitor cells required for normal response to injury.            	LGR5 and BMI1 mark intestinal stem cells in crypt base columnar cells and +4 position cells, respectively, but characterization of functional markers in these cell populations is limited. ID1 maintains the stem cell potential of embryonic, neural, and long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells. Here, we show in both human and mouse intestine that ID1 is expressed in cycling columnar cells, +4 position cells, and transit-amplifying cells in the crypt. Lineage tracing revealed ID1+ cells to be self-renewing, multipotent stem/progenitor cells that are responsible for the long-term renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Single ID1+ cells can generate long-lived organoids resembling mature intestinal epithelium. Complete knockout of Id1 or selective deletion of Id1 in intestinal epithelium or in LGR5+ stem cells sensitizes mice to chemical-induced colon injury. These experiments identify ID1 as a marker for intestinal stem/progenitor cells and demonstrate a role for ID1 in maintaining the potential for repair in response to colonic injury.

33328217        	MNK inhibition sensitizes KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer to mTORC1 inhibition by reducing eIF4E phosphorylation and c-MYC expression.            	KRAS-mutant colorectal cancers (CRC) are resistant to therapeutics, presenting a significant problem for ~40% of cases. Rapalogs, which inhibit mTORC1 and thus protein synthesis, are significantly less potent in KRAS-mutant CRC. Using Kras-mutant mouse models and mouse- and patient-derived organoids we demonstrate that KRAS with G12D mutation fundamentally rewires translation to increase both bulk and mRNA-specific translation initiation. This occurs via the MNK/eIF4E pathway culminating in sustained expression of c-MYC. By genetic and small molecule targeting of this pathway, we acutely sensitize KRASG12D models to rapamycin via suppression of c-MYC. We show that 45% of CRCs have high signaling through mTORC1 and the MNKs, with this signature correlating with a 3.5-year shorter cancer-specific survival in a subset of patients. This work provides a c-MYC-dependent co-targeting strategy with remarkable potency in multiple Kras-mutant mouse models and metastatic human organoids and identifies a patient population who may benefit from its clinical application.

29556825        	Breast Organotypic Cancer Models.            	Breast cancer is the most common cancer type diagnosed in women, it represents a critical public health problem worldwide, with 1,671,149 estimated new cases and nearly 571,000 related deaths. Research on breast cancer has mainly been conducted using two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and animal models. The usefulness of these models is reflected in the vast knowledge accumulated over the past decades. However, considering that animal models are three-dimensional (3D) in nature, the validity of the studies using 2D cell cultures has recently been questioned. Although animal models are important in cancer research, ethical questions arise about their use and usefulness as there is no clear predictivity of human disease outcome and they are very expensive and take too much time to obtain results. The poor performance or failure of most cancer drugs suggests that preclinical research on cancer has been based on an over-dependence on inadequate animal models. For these reasons, in the last few years development of alternative models has been prioritized to study human breast cancer behavior, while maintaining a 3D microenvironment, and to reduce the number of experiments conducted in animals. One way to achieve this is using organotypic cultures, which are being more frequently explored in cancer research because they mimic tissue architecture in vivo. These characteristics make organotypic cultures a valuable tool in cancer research as an alternative to replace animal models and for predicting risk assessment in humans. This chapter describes the cultures of multicellular spheroids, organoids, 3D bioreactors, and tumor slices, which are the most widely used organotypic models in breast cancer research.	
32610529        	Human Plasma-Derived 3D Cultures Model Breast Cancer Treatment Responses and Predict Clinically Effective Drug Treatment Concentrations.            	Lack of efficacy and a low overall success rate of phase I-II clinical trials are the most common failures when it comes to advancing cancer treatment. Current drug sensitivity screenings present several challenges including differences in cell growth rates, the inconsistent use of drug metrics, and the lack of translatability. Here, we present a patient-derived 3D culture model to overcome these limitations in breast cancer (BCa). The human plasma-derived 3D culture model (HuP3D) utilizes patient plasma as the matrix, where BCa cell lines and primary BCa biopsies were grown and screened for drug treatments. Several drug metrics were evaluated from relative cell count and growth rate curves. Correlations between HuP3D metrics, established preclinical models, and clinical effective concentrations in patients were determined. HuP3D efficiently supported the growth and expansion of BCa cell lines and primary breast cancer tumors as both organoids and single cells. Significant and strong correlations between clinical effective concentrations in patients were found for eight out of ten metrics for HuP3D, while a very poor positive correlation and a moderate correlation was found for 2D models and other 3D models, respectively. HuP3D is a feasible and efficacious platform for supporting the growth and expansion of BCa, allowing high-throughput drug screening and predicting clinically effective therapies better than current preclinical models.	
32562613        	Methodology for processing mastectomy and cryopreservation of breast cancer tissue in a resource- poor setting: A pilot study.            	There is scarcity of breast cancer tissues derived from women of African origin available for patient - derived xenograft and organoid models.                We aim to create a versatile protocol for processing mastectomy and cryopreservation of breast cancer tissue.                An immediate collection of breast cancer tissue from mastectomy was bathed in 4 °C HBSS and immediately transferred to 4 °C RPMI1640 containing HEPES, 10% FBS, Streptomycin and Penicillin. Tissues were processed over ice yielding nine samples of cold ischemic time (20-45 min) stored at 3 min interval. Cut samples were transferred into cryovials containing 4 °C cryoprotectant agent (90% FBS +10% Me2SO) before snap -freezing in liquid Nitrogen vapour and final short-term storage in -80 °C Freezer. The histomorphology, tissue and molecular viability were assessed.                The cold ischemic times had no detrimental effect to the nine samples despite being processed in a resource poor setting, hence providing a reproducible and reliable protocol.

33046804        	Survival of patients with deficient mismatch repair metastatic colorectal cancer in the pre-immunotherapy era.            	Metastatic colorectal cancer patients with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR mCRC) benefit from immunotherapy. Interpretation of the single-arm immunotherapy trials is complicated by insignificant survival data during systemic non-immunotherapy. We present survival data on a large, comprehensive cohort of dMMR mCRC patients, treated with or without systemic non-immunotherapy.                Two hundred and eighty-one dMMR mCRC patients (n = 54 from three prospective Phase 3 CAIRO trials; n = 227 from the Netherlands Cancer Registry). Overall survival was analysed from diagnosis of mCRC (OS), from initiation of first-line (OS1) and second-line (OS2) systemic treatment. Cox regression analysis examined prognostic factors. As comparison for OS 2746 MMR proficient mCRC patients were identified.                Of 281 dMMR patients, 62% received first-line and 26% second-line treatment. Median OS was 16.0 months (13.8-19.6) with antitumour therapy and 2.5 months (1.8-3.5) in untreated patients. OS1 was 12.8 months (10.7-15.2) and OS2 6.2 months (5.4-8.9) in treated dMMR patients. Treated dMMR patients had a 7.6-month shorter median OS than pMMR patients.                Available data from immunotherapy trials lack a control arm with standard systemic treatment. Given the poor outcome compared to the immunotherapy results, our data strongly suggest a survival benefit of immunotherapy in dMMR mCRC patients.

30783098        	An FBXW7-ZEB2 axis links EMT and tumour microenvironment to promote colorectal cancer stem cells and chemoresistance.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop recurrence after chemotherapy owing to the survival of stem cell-like cells referred to as cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). The origin of CSCs is linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Currently, it remains poorly understood how EMT programmes enable CSCs residing in the tumour microenvironment to escape the effects of chemotherapy. This study identifies a key molecular pathway that is responsible for the formation of drug-resistant CSC populations. Using a modified yeast-2-hybrid system and 2D gel-based proteomics methods, we show that the E3-ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 directly binds and degrades the EMT-inducing transcription factor ZEB2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Loss of FBXW7 induces an EMT that can be effectively reversed by knockdown of ZEB2. The FBXW7-ZEB2 axis regulates such important cancer cell features, as stemness/dedifferentiation, chemoresistance and cell migration in vitro, ex vivo and in animal models of metastasis. High expression of ZEB2 in cancer tissues defines the reduced ZEB2 expression in the cancer-associated stroma in patients and in murine intestinal organoids, demonstrating a tumour-stromal crosstalk that modulates a niche and EMT activation. Our study thus uncovers a new molecular mechanism, by which the CRC cells display differences in resistance to chemotherapy and metastatic potential.	
32932616        	Organotypic Culture of Acinar Cells for the Study of Pancreatic Cancer Initiation.            	The carcinogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) progresses according to multi-step evolution, whereby the disease acquires increasingly aggressive pathological features. On the other hand, disease inception is poorly investigated. Decoding the cascade of events that leads to oncogenic transformation is crucial to design strategies for early diagnosis as well as to tackle tumor onset. Lineage-tracing experiments demonstrated that pancreatic cancerous lesions originate from acinar cells, a highly specialized cell type in the pancreatic epithelium. Primary acinar cells can survive in vitro as organoid-like 3D spheroids, which can transdifferentiate into cells with a clear ductal morphology in response to different cell- and non-cell-autonomous stimuli. This event, termed acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, recapitulates the histological and molecular features of disease initiation. Here, we will discuss the isolation and culture of primary pancreatic acinar cells, providing a historical and technical perspective. The impact of pancreatic cancer research will also be debated. In particular, we will dissect the roles of transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic reprogramming for tumor initiation and we will show how that can be modeled using ex vivo acinar cell cultures. Finally, mechanisms of PDA initiation described using organotypical cultures will be reviewed.	
32424251        	Bim, Puma and Noxa upregulation by Naftopidil sensitizes ovarian cancer to the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 and the MEK inhibitor Trametinib.            	Ovarian cancer represents the first cause of mortality from gynecologic malignancies due to frequent chemoresistance occurrence. Increasing the [BH3-only Bim, Puma, Noxa proapoptotic]/[Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 antiapoptotic] proteins ratio was proven to efficiently kill ovarian carcinoma cells and development of new molecules to imbalance Bcl-2 member equilibrium are strongly required. Drug repurposing constitutes an innovative approach to rapidly develop therapeutic strategies through exploitation of established drugs already approved for the treatment of noncancerous diseases. This strategy allowed a renewed interest for Naftopidil, an α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist commercialized in Japan for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Naftopidil was reported to decrease the incidence of prostate cancer and its derivative was described to increase BH3-only protein expression in some cancer models. Based on these arguments, we evaluated the effects of Naftopidil on ovarian carcinoma and showed that Naftopidil reduced cell growth and increased the expression of the BH3-only proteins Bim, Puma and Noxa. This effect was independent of α1-adrenergic receptors blocking and involved ATF4 or JNK pathway depending on cellular context. Finally, Naftopidil-induced BH3-only members sensitized our models to ABT-737 and Trametinib treatments, in vitro as well as ex vivo, in patient-derived organoid models.	
24859162        	Indian Hedgehog mediates gastrin-induced proliferation in stomach of adult mice.            	Loss of expression of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) from parietal cells results in hypergastrinemia in mice, accompanied by increased expression of Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) and hyperproliferation of surface mucous cells. We investigated whether hypergastrinemia induces gastric epithelial proliferation by activating Ihh signaling in mice.                We studied mice with parietal cell-specific deletion of Shh (PC-Shh(KO)) and hypergastrinemia, crossed with gastrin-deficient (GKO) mice (PC-Shh(KO)/GKO). When mice were 3-4 months old, gastric tissues were collected and analyzed by histology, for incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, and for expression of the surface mucous cell marker Ulex europaeus. PC-Shh(KO)/GKO mice were given gastrin infusions for 7 days; gastric surface epithelium was collected and expression of Ihh was quantified by laser capture microdissection followed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Mouse stomach-derived organoids were incubated with or without inhibitors of WNT (DKK1) or Smoothened (vismodegib) and then cocultured with immortalized stomach mesenchymal cells, to assess proliferative responses to gastrin.                Gastric tissues from PC-Shh(KO)/GKO mice with hypergastrinemia had an expanded surface pit epithelium, indicated by a significant increase in numbers of bromodeoxyuridine- and Ulex europaeus-positive cells, but there was no evidence for hyperproliferation. Gastrin infusion of PC PC-Shh(KO)/GKO mice increased expression of Ihh and proliferation within the surface epithelium compared with mice given infusions of saline. In gastric organoids cocultured with immortalized stomach mesenchymal cells, antagonists of WNT and Smoothened inhibited gastrin-induced proliferation and WNT activity. Activity of WNT in media collected from immortalized stomach mesenchymal cells correlated with increased expression of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1, and was inhibited by DKK1 or vismodegib.

In East Asian countries, gastric cancer incidence is high, but detection rates for germline CDH1 mutations that cause hereditary diffuse gastric cancers (HDGCs) are low. Consequently, screens and genetic testing for HDGC are often considered unimportant. Since the first germline truncating CDH1 mutations in Japanese patients were reported, some HDGC cases have been reported, and some of these involve large germline rearrangements and de novo mutation of CDH1. New methods for mutation detection--such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, array comparative genomic hybridization, and exome sequencing--have become available, as have new experimental models, including novel gene-knockout mice and gastric organoids. Because of these advances, searches for candidate genes (e.g., CTNNA1, MAP3K6) and our understanding of HDGC pathogenesis have improved in recent years; moreover, there have been substantial changes in the field since the current HDGC consensus guidelines were released. This review focuses on recent issues and advances in the study of HDGC. For example, lobular breast cancer cases and de novo occurrences of DGC are unlikely to meet the existing criteria for genetic testing, but current evidence indicates that some such cases may be good candidates for genetic testing. It is important to recognize that HDGC is a syndrome and that lobular breast cancer can be the first manifestation of this syndrome. CDH1 testing, including analyses of large genomic rearrangements, should be recommended even in countries where few HDGC cases have been reported.

32499301        	Discovery of New Targets to Control Metastasis in Pancreatic Cancer by Single-cell Transcriptomics Analysis of Circulating Tumor Cells.            	Metastasis development is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and yet, few preclinical systems to recapitulate its full spreading process are available. Thus, modeling of tumor progression to metastasis is urgently needed. In this work, we describe the generation of highly metastatic PDAC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models and subsequent single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of circulating tumor cells (CTC), isolated by human HLA sorting, to identify altered signaling and metabolic pathways, as well as potential therapeutic targets. The mouse models developed liver and lung metastasis with a high reproducibility rate. Isolated CTCs were highly tumorigenic, had metastatic potential, and single-cell RNA-seq showed that their expression profiles clustered separately from those of their matched primary and metastatic tumors and were characterized by low expression of cell-cycle and extracellular matrix-associated genes. CTC transcriptomics identified survivin (BIRC5), a key regulator of mitosis and apoptosis, as one of the highest upregulated genes during metastatic spread. Pharmacologic inhibition of survivin with YM155 or survivin knockdown promoted cell death in organoid models as well as anoikis, suggesting that survivin facilitates cancer cell survival in circulation. Treatment of metastatic PDX models with YM155 alone and in combination with chemotherapy hindered the metastatic development resulting in improved survival. Metastatic PDX mouse model development allowed the identification of survivin as a promising therapeutic target to prevent the metastatic dissemination in PDAC.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32183295        	Vitamin C Restricts the Emergence of Acquired Resistance to EGFR-Targeted Therapies in Colorectal Cancer.            	The long-term efficacy of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-targeted antibody cetuximab in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is limited by the emergence of drug-resistant (persister) cells. Recent studies in other cancer types have shown that cells surviving initial treatment with targeted agents are often vulnerable to alterations in cell metabolism including oxidative stress. Vitamin C (VitC) is an antioxidant agent which can paradoxically trigger oxidative stress at pharmacological dose. Here we tested the hypothesis that VitC in combination with cetuximab could restrain the emergence of secondary resistance to EGFR blockade in CRC RAS/BRAF wild-type models. We found that addition of VitC to cetuximab impairs the emergence of drug persisters, limits the growth of CRC organoids, and significantly delays acquired resistance in CRC patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, proteomic and metabolic flux analysis shows that cetuximab blunts carbohydrate metabolism by blocking glucose uptake and glycolysis, beyond promoting slow but progressive ROS production. In parallel, VitC disrupts iron homeostasis and further increases ROS levels ultimately leading to ferroptosis. Combination of VitC and cetuximab orchestrates a synthetic lethal metabolic cell death program triggered by ATP depletion and oxidative stress, which effectively limits the emergence of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies. Considering that high-dose VitC is known to be safe in cancer patients, our findings might have clinical impact on CRC patients treated with anti-EGFR therapies.	
27570066        	3D Culture Supports Long-Term Expansion of Mouse and Human Nephrogenic Progenitors.            	Transit-amplifying nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) generate all of the nephrons of the mammalian kidney during development. Their limited numbers, poor in vitro expansion, and difficult accessibility in humans have slowed basic and translational research into renal development and diseases. Here, we show that with appropriate 3D culture conditions, it is possible to support long-term expansion of primary mouse and human fetal NPCs as well as NPCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Expanded NPCs maintain genomic stability, molecular homogeneity, and nephrogenic potential in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Cultured NPCs are amenable to gene targeting and can form nephron organoids that engraft in vivo, functionally couple to the host's circulatory system, and produce urine-like metabolites via filtration. Together, these findings provide a technological platform for studying human nephrogenesis, modeling and diagnosing renal diseases, and drug discovery.                Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

31088077        	Highly Homogeneous Biotinylated Carbon Nanodots: Red-Emitting Nanoheaters as Theranostic Agents toward Precision Cancer Medicine.            	Very recent red-emissive carbon nanodots (CDs) have shown potential as near-infrared converting tools to produce local heat useful in cancer theranostics. Besides, CDs seem very appealing for clinical applications combining hyperthermia, imaging, and drug delivery in a single platform capable of selectively targeting cancer cells. However, CDs still suffer from dramatic dot-to-dot variability issues such that a rational design of their structural, optical, and chemical characteristics for medical applications has been impossible so far. Herein, we report for the first time a simple and highly controllable layer-by-layer synthesis of biotin-decorated CDs with monodisperse size distribution, well established polymeric shell thickness, and degree of surface functionalization, endowed with strong red luminescence and the ability to convert NIR light into heat. These CDs, henceforth named CDs-PEG-BT, consist of a carbonaceous core passivated with biotin-terminated PEG2000 chains, which we demonstrate as active targeting groups to recognize cancer cells. The CDs-PEG-BT are designed to efficiently incorporate a high amount of anticancer drugs such as irinotecan (16-28%) and to act as NIR-activated nanoheaters capable of triggering local hyperthermia and massive drug release inside tumors, thus provoking sudden and efficient tumor death. The potential of the irinotecan-loaded CDs-PEG-BT (CDs-PEG-BT@IT) in fluorescence imaging was studied on 2D cultures and on complex 3D spheroids mimicking in vivo tumor architectures, showing their capability of selectively entering cancer cells through biotin receptors overexpressed in cell membranes. The efficient anticancer effect of these CDs was thoroughly assessed on multicellular 3D spheroids and patient organoids (tumor-on-a-dish preclinical models) to predict the drug response in humans in view of personalized medicine applications. CDs-PEG-BT@IT have a smart combination of properties, which pave the way to their real-world use as anticancer theranostic agents for image-guided photothermal applications.	
28251176        	Bioprinting the Cancer Microenvironment.            	Cancer is intrinsically complex, comprising both heterogeneous cellular compositions and microenvironmental cues. During the various stages of cancer initiation, development, and metastasis, cell-cell interactions (involving vascular and immune cells besides cancerous cells) as well as cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions (e.g., alteration in stiffness and composition of the surrounding matrix) play major roles. Conventional cancer models both two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) present numerous limitations as they lack good vascularization and cannot mimic the complexity of tumors, thereby restricting their use as biomimetic models for applications such as drug screening and fundamental cancer biology studies. Bioprinting as an emerging biofabrication platform enables the creation of high-resolution 3D structures and has been extensively used in the past decade to model multiple organs and diseases. More recently, this versatile technique has further found its application in studying cancer genesis, growth, metastasis, and drug responses through creation of accurate models that recreate the complexity of the cancer microenvironment. In this review we will focus first on cancer biology and limitations with current cancer models. We then detail the current bioprinting strategies including the selection of bioinks for capturing the properties of the tumor matrices, after which we discuss bioprinting of vascular structures that are critical toward construction of complex 3D cancer organoids. We finally conclude with current literature on bioprinted cancer models and propose future perspectives.	
32001555        	SUMO pathway inhibition targets an aggressive pancreatic cancer subtype.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) still carries a dismal prognosis with an overall 5-year survival rate of 9%. Conventional combination chemotherapies are a clear advance in the treatment of PDAC; however, subtypes of the disease exist, which exhibit extensive resistance to such therapies. Genomic MYC amplifications represent a distinct subset of PDAC with an aggressive tumour biology. It is clear that hyperactivation of MYC generates dependencies that can be exploited therapeutically. The aim of the study was to find and to target MYC-associated dependencies.                We analysed human PDAC gene expression datasets. Results were corroborated by the analysis of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in a large PDAC cohort using immunohistochemistry. A SUMO inhibitor was used and characterised using human and murine two-dimensional, organoid and in vivo models of PDAC.                We observed that MYC is connected to the SUMOylation machinery in PDAC. Components of the SUMO pathway characterise a PDAC subtype with a dismal prognosis and we provide evidence that hyperactivation of MYC is connected to an increased sensitivity to pharmacological SUMO inhibition.                SUMO inhibitor-based therapies should be further developed for an aggressive PDAC subtype.                © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

31720076        	From genomics to functions: preclinical mouse models for understanding oncogenic pathways in prostate cancer.            	Next-generation sequencing has revealed numerous genomic alterations that induce aberrant signaling activities in prostate cancer (PCa). Among them are pathways affecting multiple cancer types, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p53, Rb, Ras/Raf/MAPK, Myc, FGF, and Wnt signaling pathways, as well as ones that are prominent in PCa, including alterations in genes of AR signaling, the ETS family, NKX3.1, and SPOP. Cross talk among the oncogenic pathways can confer PCa resistance to therapy, particularly in advanced tumors, which are castration-resistant or show neuroendocrine features. Various experimental models, such as cancer cell lines, animal models, and patient-derived xenografts and organoids have been utilized to dissect PCa progression mechanisms. Here, we review the current preclinical mouse models for studying the most commonly altered pathways in PCa, with an emphasis on their interplays. We highlight the power of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) in translating genomic discoveries into understanding of the functions of these oncogenic events in vivo. Developing and analyzing PCa mouse models will undoubtedly continue to offer new insights into tumor biology and guide novel rationalized therapy.                AJCR Copyright © 2019.	
27974798        	Mechanism of early dissemination and metastasis in Her2+ mammary cancer.            	Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths; metastatic lesions develop from disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) that can remain dormant. Metastasis-initiating cells are thought to originate from a subpopulation present in progressed, invasive tumours. However, DCCs detected in patients before the manifestation of breast-cancer metastasis contain fewer genetic abnormalities than primary tumours or than DCCs from patients with metastases. These findings, and those in pancreatic cancer and melanoma models, indicate that dissemination might occur during the early stages of tumour evolution. However, the mechanisms that might allow early disseminated cancer cells (eDCCs) to complete all steps of metastasis are unknown. Here we show that, in early lesions in mice and before any apparent primary tumour masses are detected, there is a sub-population of Her2+p-p38lop-Atf2loTwist1hiE-cadlo early cancer cells that is invasive and can spread to target organs. Intra-vital imaging and organoid studies of early lesions showed that Her2+ eDCC precursors invaded locally, intravasated and lodged in target organs. Her2+ eDCCs activated a Wnt-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like dissemination program but without complete loss of the epithelial phenotype, which was reversed by Her2 or Wnt inhibition. Notably, although the majority of eDCCs were Twist1hiE-cadlo and dormant, they eventually initiated metastasis. Our work identifies a mechanism for early dissemination in which Her2 aberrantly activates a program similar to mammary ductal branching that generates eDCCs that are capable of forming metastasis after a dormancy phase.	
27680706        	Frizzled proteins are colonic epithelial receptors for C. difficile toxin B.            	Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) is a critical virulence factor that causes diseases associated with C. difficile infection. Here we carried out CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome-wide screens and identified the members of the Wnt receptor frizzled family (FZDs) as TcdB receptors. TcdB binds to the conserved Wnt-binding site known as the cysteine-rich domain (CRD), with the highest affinity towards FZD1, 2 and 7. TcdB competes with Wnt for binding to FZDs, and its binding blocks Wnt signalling. FZD1/2/7 triple-knockout cells are highly resistant to TcdB, and recombinant FZD2-CRD prevented TcdB binding to the colonic epithelium. Colonic organoids cultured from FZD7-knockout mice, combined with knockdown of FZD1 and 2, showed increased resistance to TcdB. The colonic epithelium in FZD7-knockout mice was less susceptible to TcdB-induced tissue damage in vivo. These findings establish FZDs as physiologically relevant receptors for TcdB in the colonic epithelium.	
25137487        	Illuminating breast cancer invasion: diverse roles for cell-cell interactions.            	Metastasis begins when tumors invade into surrounding tissues. In breast cancer, the study of cell interactions has provided fundamental insights into this complex process. Powerful intravital and 3D organoid culture systems have emerged that enable biologists to model the complexity of cell interactions during cancer invasion in real-time. Recent studies utilizing these techniques reveal distinct mechanisms through which multiple cancer cell and stromal cell subpopulations interact, including paracrine signaling, direct cell-cell adhesion, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Three cell interaction mechanisms have emerged to explain how breast tumors become invasive: epithelial-mesenchymal transition, collective invasion, and the macrophage-tumor cell feedback loop. Future work is needed to distinguish whether these mechanisms are mutually exclusive or whether they cooperate to drive metastasis.                 Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

28649646        	Human brain metastatic stroma attracts breast cancer cells via chemokines CXCL16 and CXCL12.            	The tumor microenvironment is composed of heterogeneous populations of cells, including cancer, immune, and stromal cells. Progression of tumor growth and initiation of metastasis is critically dependent on the reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and stroma. Through RNA-Seq and protein analyses, we found that cancer-associated fibroblasts derived from human breast cancer brain metastasis express significantly higher levels of chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16 than fibroblasts from primary breast tumors or normal breast. To further understand the interplay between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts from each site, we developed three-dimensional organoids composed of patient-derived primary or brain metastasis cancer cells with matching cancer-associated fibroblasts. Three-dimensional CAF aggregates generated from brain metastasis promote migration of cancer cells more effectively than cancer-associated fibroblast aggregates derived from primary tumor or normal breast stromal cells. Treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist and/or CXCL16 neutralizing antibody, alone or in combination, significantly inhibited migration of cancer cells to brain metastatic cancer-associated fibroblast aggregates. These results demonstrate that human brain metastasis cancer-associated fibroblasts potently attract breast cancer cells via chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16, and blocking CXCR6-CXCL16/CXCR4-CXCL12 receptor-ligand interactions may be an effective therapy for preventing breast cancer brain metastasis.	
31778828        	Human Colon-on-a-Chip Enables Continuous In Vitro Analysis of Colon Mucus Layer Accumulation and Physiology.            	The mucus layer in the human colon protects against commensal bacteria and pathogens, and defects in its unique bilayered structure contribute to intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis. However, our understanding of colon physiology is limited by the lack of in vitro models that replicate human colonic mucus layer structure and function. Here, we investigated if combining organ-on-a-chip and organoid technologies can be leveraged to develop a human-relevant in vitro model of colon mucus physiology.                A human colon-on-a-chip (Colon Chip) microfluidic device lined by primary patient-derived colonic epithelial cells was used to recapitulate mucus bilayer formation, and to visualize mucus accumulation in living cultures noninvasively.                The Colon Chip supports spontaneous goblet cell differentiation and accumulation of a mucus bilayer with impenetrable and penetrable layers, and a thickness similar to that observed in the human colon, while maintaining a subpopulation of proliferative epithelial cells. Live imaging of the mucus layer formation on-chip showed that stimulation of the colonic epithelium with prostaglandin E2, which is increased during inflammation, causes rapid mucus volume expansion via an Na-K-Cl cotransporter 1 ion channel-dependent increase in its hydration state, but no increase in de novo mucus secretion.                This study shows the production of colonic mucus with a physiologically relevant bilayer structure in vitro, which can be analyzed in real time noninvasively. The Colon Chip may offer a new preclinical tool to analyze the role of mucus in human intestinal homeostasis as well as diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and cancer.

28292441        	SPOP Mutation Drives Prostate Tumorigenesis In Vivo through Coordinate Regulation of PI3K/mTOR and AR Signaling.            	Recurrent point mutations in SPOP define a distinct molecular subclass of prostate cancer. Here, we describe a mouse model showing that mutant SPOP drives prostate tumorigenesis in vivo. Conditional expression of mutant SPOP in the prostate dramatically altered phenotypes in the setting of Pten loss, with early neoplastic lesions (high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) with striking nuclear atypia and invasive, poorly differentiated carcinoma. In mouse prostate organoids, mutant SPOP drove increased proliferation and a transcriptional signature consistent with human prostate cancer. Using these models and human prostate cancer samples, we show that SPOP mutation activates both PI3K/mTOR and androgen receptor signaling, effectively uncoupling the normal negative feedback between these two pathways.

30670657        	Stromal-derived interleukin 6 drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and therapy resistance in esophageal adenocarcinoma.            	Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has a dismal prognosis, and survival benefits of recent multimodality treatments remain small. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to contribute to poor outcome by conferring therapy resistance to various cancer types, but this has not been explored in EAC. Importantly, a targeted strategy to circumvent CAF-induced resistance has yet to be identified. By using EAC patient-derived CAFs, organoid cultures, and xenograft models we identified IL-6 as the stromal driver of therapy resistance in EAC. IL-6 activated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, which was accompanied by enhanced treatment resistance, migratory capacity, and clonogenicity. Inhibition of IL-6 restored drug sensitivity in patient-derived organoid cultures and cell lines. Analysis of patient gene expression profiles identified ADAM12 as a noninflammation-related serum-borne marker for IL-6-producing CAFs, and serum levels of this marker predicted unfavorable responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in EAC patients. These results demonstrate a stromal contribution to therapy resistance in EAC. This signaling can be targeted to resensitize EAC to therapy, and its activity can be measured using serum-borne markers.                Copyright © 2019 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.	
30518683        	CD4+ T cells induce rejection of urothelial tumors after immune checkpoint blockade.            	Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) provides clinical benefit to a minority of patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC). The role of CD4+ T cells in ICB-induced antitumor activity is not well defined; however, CD4+ T cells are speculated to play a supportive role in the development of CD8+ T cells that kill tumor cells after recognition of tumor antigens presented by MHC class I. To investigate the mechanisms of ICB-induced activity against UC, we developed mouse organoid-based transplantable models that have histologic and genetic similarity to human bladder cancer. We found that ICB can induce tumor rejection and protective immunity with these systems in a manner dependent on CD4+ T cells but not reliant on CD8+ T cells. Evaluation of tumor infiltrates and draining lymph nodes after ICB revealed expansion of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells. Tumor cells in this system express MHC class I, MHC class II, and the IFN-γ receptor (Ifngr1), but none were necessary for ICB-induced tumor rejection. IFN-γ neutralization blocked ICB activity, and, in mice depleted of CD4+ T cells, IFN-γ ectopically expressed in the tumor microenvironment was sufficient to inhibit growth of tumors in which the epithelial compartment lacked Ifngr1. Our findings suggest unappreciated CD4+ T cell-dependent mechanisms of ICB activity, principally mediated through IFN-γ effects on the microenvironment.	
28242812        	CRISPR Knockout of the HuR Gene Causes a Xenograft Lethal Phenotype.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, whereas colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer. The RNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1) supports a pro-oncogenic network in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cells through enhanced HuR expression. Using a publically available database, HuR expression levels were determined to be increased in primary PDA and colorectal cancer tumor cohorts as compared with normal pancreas and colon tissues, respectively. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was successfully used to delete the HuR gene in both PDA (MIA PaCa-2 and Hs 766T) and colorectal cancer (HCT116) cell lines. HuR deficiency has a mild phenotype, in vitro, as HuR-deficient MIA PaCa-2 (MIA.HuR-KO(-/-)) cells had increased apoptosis when compared with isogenic wild-type (MIA.HuR-WT(+/+)) cells. Using this isogenic system, mRNAs were identified that specifically bound to HuR and were required for transforming a two-dimensional culture into three dimensional (i.e., organoids). Importantly, HuR-deficient MIA PaCa-2 and Hs 766T cells were unable to engraft tumors in vivo compared with control HuR-proficient cells, demonstrating a unique xenograft lethal phenotype. Although not as a dramatic phenotype, CRISPR knockout HuR HCT116 colon cancer cells (HCT.HuR-KO(-/-)) showed significantly reduced in vivo tumor growth compared with controls (HCT.HuR-WT(+/+)). Finally, HuR deletion affects KRAS activity and controls a subset of pro-oncogenic genes.Implications: The work reported here supports the notion that targeting HuR is a promising therapeutic strategy to treat GI malignancies.

27310872        	Expression of μ-protocadherin is negatively regulated by the activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway in normal and cancer colorectal enterocytes.            	Mu-protocadherin (MUCDHL) is an adhesion molecule predominantly expressed by colorectal epithelial cells which is markedly downregulated upon malignant transformation. Notably, treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with mesalazine lead to increased expression of MUCDHL, and is associated with sequestration of β-catenin on the plasma membrane and inhibition of its transcriptional activity. To better characterize the causal relationship between β-catenin and MUCDHL expression, we performed various experiments in which CRC cell lines and normal colonic organoids were subjected to culture conditions inhibiting (FH535 treatment, transcription factor 7-like 2 siRNA inactivation, Wnt withdrawal) or stimulating (LiCl treatment) β-catenin activity. We show here that expression of MUCDHL is negatively regulated by functional activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. This finding was observed in cell culture systems representing conditions of physiological stimulation and upon constitutive activation of β-catenin in CRC. The ability of MUCDHL to sequester and inhibit β-catenin appears to provide a positive feedback enforcing the effect of β-catenin inhibitors rather than serving as the primary mechanism responsible for β-catenin inhibition. Moreover, MUCDHL might have a role as biomarker in the development of CRC chemoprevention drugs endowed with β-catenin inhibitory activity.	
28462377        	Gastric Cancer in the Era of Precision Medicine.            	Gastric cancer (GC) remains the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with limited therapeutic strategies available. With the advent of next-generation sequencing and new preclinical model technologies, our understanding of its pathogenesis and molecular alterations continues to be revolutionized. Recently, the genomic landscape of GC has been delineated. Molecular characterization and novel therapeutic targets of each molecular subtype have been identified. At the same time, patient-derived tumor xenografts and organoids now comprise effective tools for genetic evolution studies, biomarker identification, drug screening, and preclinical evaluation of personalized medicine strategies for GC patients. These advances are making it feasible to integrate clinical, genome-based and phenotype-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods and apply them to individual GC patients in the era of precision medicine.	
31830880        	3D Culture Modelling: An Emerging Approach for Translational Cancer Research in Sarcomas.            	Sarcomas are tumours of mesenchymal origin, which can arise in bone or soft tissues. They are rare but frequently quite aggressive and with a poor outcome. New approaches are needed to characterise these tumours and their resistance mechanisms to current therapies, responsible for tumour recurrence and treatment failure. This review is focused on the potential of three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models, including multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTS) and organoids, and the latest data about their utility for the study on important properties for tumour development. The use of spheroids as a particularly valuable alternative for compound high throughput screening (HTS) in different areas of cancer biology is also discussed, which enables the identification of new therapeutic opportunities in commonly resistant tumours.

32016468        	Impact of a high‑fat diet on intestinal stem cells and epithelial barrier function in middle‑aged female mice.            	A high‑fat diet (HFD) or obesity‑promoting diet is closely associated with metabolic diseases and intestinal tumors, particularly in middle‑aged individuals (typically 45‑64 years old). The intestinal epithelium constitutes a barrier that separates the host from the food and microbiota in the gut, and thus, a dysfunctional epithelium is associated with a number of diseases. However, the changes caused to the function of intestinal epithelium in response to an HFD have not been well‑studied to date. In the present study, middle‑aged female mice (12 months old) fed an HFD for a period of 14 weeks were used to determine the effects of HFD on the intestine. Characteristics including the body weight, fat deposition, glucose metabolism, inflammatory state and intestinal morphology were assessed, while the intestinal stem cell (ISC) counts and the ability of isolated intestinal crypts to form organoid bodies in 3D culture were examined. Intestinal epithelial barrier function, including secretory defense, tight junctions and cell apoptosis, were also studied. Morphologically, the HFD resulted in a mild reduction in the length of villi of the small intestine, the colon length and the depth of colon crypts. In addition, the ISC counts were increased in the small intestine and colon in HFD‑fed mice. The ability of crypts to grow into organoids (mini‑guts) was also increased in crypts obtained from mice fed an HFD, while HFD compromised the epithelial barrier function of the colon. These results demonstrated how an HFD affects the intestinal epithelium and highlighted the need to carefully consider dietary patterns.	
33542244        	Hsp90-stabilized MIF supports tumor progression via macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer.            	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an upstream regulator of innate immunity, but its expression is increased in some cancers via stabilization with HSP90-associated chaperones. Here, we show that MIF stabilization is tumor-specific in an acute colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse model, leading to tumor-specific functions and selective therapeutic vulnerabilities. Therefore, we demonstrate that a Mif deletion reduced CRC tumor growth. Further, we define a dual role for MIF in CRC tumor progression. Mif deletion protects mice from inflammation-associated tumor initiation, confirming the action of MIF on host inflammatory pathways; however, macrophage recruitment, neoangiogenesis, and proliferative responses are reduced in Mif-deficient tumors once the tumors are established. Thus, during neoplastic transformation, the function of MIF switches from a proinflammatory cytokine to an angiogenesis promoting factor within our experimental model. Mechanistically, Mif-containing tumor cells regulate angiogenic gene expression via a MIF/CD74/MAPK axis in vitro. Clinical correlation studies of CRC patients show the shortest overall survival for patients with high MIF levels in combination with CD74 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 to reduce MIF levels decreased tumor growth in vivo, and selectively reduced the growth of organoids derived from murine and human tumors without affecting organoids derived from healthy epithelial cells. Therefore, novel, clinically relevant Hsp90 inhibitors provide therapeutic selectivity by interfering with tumorigenic MIF in tumor epithelial cells but not in normal cells. Furthermore, Mif-depleted colonic tumor organoids showed growth defects compared to wild-type organoids and were less susceptible toward HSP90 inhibitor treatment. Our data support that tumor-specific stabilization of MIF promotes CRC progression and allows MIF to become a potential and selective therapeutic target in CRC.	
27639438        	Heralding a new paradigm in 3D tumor modeling.            	Numerous studies to date have contributed to a paradigm shift in modeling cancer, moving from the traditional two-dimensional culture system to three-dimensional (3D) culture systems for cancer cell culture. This led to the inception of tumor engineering, which has undergone rapid advances over the years. In line with the recognition that tumors are not merely masses of proliferating cancer cells but rather, highly complex tissues consisting of a dynamic extracellular matrix together with stromal, immune and endothelial cells, significant efforts have been made to better recapitulate the tumor microenvironment in 3D. These approaches include the development of engineered matrices and co-cultures to replicate the complexity of tumor-stroma interactions in vitro. However, the tumor engineering and cancer biology fields have traditionally relied heavily on the use of cancer cell lines as a cell source in tumor modeling. While cancer cell lines have contributed to a wealth of knowledge in cancer biology, the use of this cell source is increasingly perceived as a major contributing factor to the dismal failure rate of oncology drugs in drug development. Backing this notion is the increasing evidence that tumors possess intrinsic heterogeneity, which predominantly homogeneous cancer cell lines poorly reflect. Tumor heterogeneity contributes to therapeutic resistance in patients. To overcome this limitation, cancer cell lines are beginning to be replaced by primary tumor cell sources, in the form of patient-derived xenografts and organoids cultures. Moving forward, we propose that further advances in tumor engineering would require that tumor heterogeneity (tumor variants) be taken into consideration together with tumor complexity (tumor-stroma interactions). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of what has been achieved in recapitulating tumor complexity, and discuss the importance of incorporating tumor heterogeneity into 3D in vitro tumor models. This work carves out the roadmap for 3D tumor engineering and highlights some of the challenges that need to be addressed as we move forward into the next chapter.

28112153        	Dissecting cell-type-specific roles of androgen receptor in prostate homeostasis and regeneration through lineage tracing.            	Androgen signals through androgen receptor (AR) to influence prostate development and cancer. How stromal and epithelial AR regulate prostate homeostasis remains unclear. Using genetic lineage tracing, we systematically investigated the role of cell-autonomous AR in different prostate epithelial cell types. Here we show that AR is dispensable for basal cell maintenance, but is cell-autonomously required for the luminal differentiation of rare basal stem cells. In contrast, AR deletion in luminal cells alters cell morphology and induces transient over-proliferation, without affecting androgen-mediated luminal cell survival or regeneration. However, AR is selectively required for the maintenance of daughter cells produced by castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing luminal stem cells (CARNs). Notably, Pten loss can override AR-loss effects in both basal and luminal compartments to initiate tumours. Our data reveal distinct cell-type-specific roles of epithelial AR in orchestrating prostate homeostasis, and question the notion that epithelial AR serves as a tumour suppressor in early cancer initiation.	
33531371        	RINT1 regulates SUMOylation and the DNA damage response to preserve cellular homeostasis in pancreatic cancer.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) still presents with a dismal prognosis despite intense research. Better understanding of cellular homeostasis could identify druggable targets to improve therapy. Here we propose RAD50-interacting protein 1 (RINT1) as an essential mediator of cellular homeostasis in PDAC. In a cohort of resected PDAC, low RINT1 protein expression correlated significantly with better survival. Accordingly, RINT1 depletion caused severe growth defects in vitro associated with accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), G2 cell cycle arrest, disruption of Golgi-ER homeostasis, and cell death. Time-resolved transcriptomics corroborated by quantitative proteome and interactome analyses pointed towards defective SUMOylation after RINT1 loss, impairing nucleocytoplasmic transport and DSB response. Subcutaneous xenografts confirmed tumor response by RINT1 depletion, also resulting in a survival benefit when transferred to an orthotopic model. Primary human PDAC organoids licensed RINT1 relevance for cell viability. Taken together, our data indicate that RINT1 loss affects PDAC cell fate by disturbing SUMOylation pathways. Therefore, a RINT1 interference strategy may represent a new putative therapeutic approach.                Copyright ©2021, American Association for Cancer Research.	
25500615        	Asymmetric expression of connexins between luminal epithelial- and myoepithelial- cells is essential for contractile function of the mammary gland.            	Intercellular communication is essential for glandular functions and tissue homeostasis. Gap junctions couple cells homotypically and heterotypically and co-ordinate reciprocal responses between the different cell types. Connexins (Cxs) are the main mammalian gap junction proteins, and the distribution of some Cx subtypes in the heterotypic gap junctions is not symmetrical; in the murine mammary gland, Cx26, Cx30 and Cx32 are expressed only in the luminal epithelial cells and Cx43 is expressed only in myoepithelial cells. Expression of all four Cxs peaks during late pregnancy and throughout lactation suggesting essential roles for these proteins in the functional secretory activity of the gland. Transgenic (Tg) mice over-expressing Cx26 driven by keratin 5 promoter had an unexpected mammary phenotype: the mothers were unable to feed their pups to weaning age leading to litter starvation and demise in early to mid-lactation. The mammary gland of K5-Cx26 female mice developed normally and produced normal levels of milk protein, suggesting a defect in delivery rather than milk production. Because the mammary gland of K5-Cx26 mothers contained excessive milk, we hypothesized that the defect may be in an inability to eject the milk. Using ex vivo three-dimensional mammary organoid cultures, we showed that tissues isolated from wild-type FVB females contracted upon treatment with oxytocin, whereas, organoids from Tg mice failed to do so. Unexpectedly, we found that ectopic expression of Cx26 in myoepithelial cells altered the expression of endogenous Cx43 resulting in impaired gap junction communication, demonstrated by defective dye coupling in mammary epithelial cells of Tg mice. Inhibition of gap junction communication or knock-down of Cx43 in organoids from wild-type mice impaired contraction in response to oxytocin, recapitulating the observations from the mammary glands of Tg mice. We conclude that Cx26 acts as a trans-dominant negative for Cx43 function in myoepithelial cells, highlighting the importance of cell type-specific expression of Cxs for optimal contractile function of the mammary myoepithelium.

32127465        	SLFN11 Expression in Advanced Prostate Cancer and Response to Platinum-based Chemotherapy.            	Expression of the DNA/RNA helicase schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11) has been identified as a sensitizer of tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents including platinum chemotherapy. We assessed the impact of SLFN11 expression on response to platinum chemotherapy and outcomes in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Tumor expression of SLFN11 was assessed in 41 patients with CRPC treated with platinum chemotherapy by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of metastatic biopsy tissue (n = 27) and/or immunofluorescence in circulating tumor cells (CTC; n = 20). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to evaluate the association of SLFN11 expression with radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis included tumor histology (i.e., adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine) and the presence or absence of DNA repair aberrations. Patient-derived organoids with SLFN11 expression and after knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 were treated with platinum and assessed for changes in dose response. Patients were treated with platinum combination (N = 38) or platinum monotherapy (N = 3). Median lines of prior therapy for CRPC was two. Median OS was 8.7 months. Overexpression of SLFN11 in metastatic tumors by RNA-seq was associated with longer rPFS compared with those without overexpression (6.9 vs. 2.8 months, HR = 3.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.56-8.87; P < 0.001); similar results were observed for patients with SLFN11-positive versus SLFN11-negative CTCs (rPFS 6.0 vs. 2.2 months, HR = 4.02; 95% CI, 0.77-20.86; P = 0.002). A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ≥50% was observed in all patients with SLFN11 overexpression. No association was observed between SLFN11 expression and OS. On multivariable analysis, SLFN11 was an independent factor associated with rPFS on platinum therapy. Platinum response of organoids expressing SLFN11 was reduced after SLFN11 knockout. Our data suggest that SLFN11 expression might identify patients with CRPC with a better response to platinum chemotherapy independent of histology or other genomic alterations. Additional studies, also in the context of PARP inhibitors, are warranted.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
28186126        	Molecular dissection of colorectal cancer in pre-clinical models identifies biomarkers predicting sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors.            	Colorectal carcinoma represents a heterogeneous entity, with only a fraction of the tumours responding to available therapies, requiring a better molecular understanding of the disease in precision oncology. To address this challenge, the OncoTrack consortium recruited 106 CRC patients (stages I-IV) and developed a pre-clinical platform generating a compendium of drug sensitivity data totalling >4,000 assays testing 16 clinical drugs on patient-derived in vivo and in vitro models. This large biobank of 106 tumours, 35 organoids and 59 xenografts, with extensive omics data comparing donor tumours and derived models provides a resource for advancing our understanding of CRC. Models recapitulate many of the genetic and transcriptomic features of the donors, but defined less complex molecular sub-groups because of the loss of human stroma. Linking molecular profiles with drug sensitivity patterns identifies novel biomarkers, including a signature outperforming RAS/RAF mutations in predicting sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab.	
29774115        	An improved method for culturing patient-derived colorectal cancer spheroids.            	Recent advances allowed culturing and examination of patient-derived colorectal cancer (PD-CRC) cells as organoids or spheroids. To be applied to practical personalized medicine, however, current methods still need to be strengthened for higher efficiency. Here we report an improved method to propagate PD-CRC tumor initiating cells (TICs) in spheroid culture. We established > 100 cancer spheroid lines derived from independent colorectal cancer patients employing a serum-containing medium with additional inhibitors, Y27632 and SB431542. Because colorectal cancer spheroids showed wide-range growth rates depending on the patient tumors, we searched for supplementary factors that accelerated proliferation of slow-growing CRC-TIC spheroids. To this end, we introduced a convenient growth-monitoring method using a luciferase reporter. We found that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were critical for steady propagation of a subset of CRC-TIC spheroids carrying the wild-type RAS and RAF genes. We also identified 5'-(N-ethyl-carboxamido)-adenosine (NECA), an adenosine receptor agonist, as an essential supplement for another subset of spheroids. Based on these results, we propose to optimize culture conditions for CRC-TIC spheroids by adjusting to the respective tumor samples. Our method provides a versatile tool that can be applied to personalized chemotherapy evaluation in prospective clinical studies.	
30362859        	Luteolin inhibits Musashi1 binding to RNA and disrupts cancer phenotypes in glioblastoma cells.            	RNA binding proteins have emerged as critical oncogenic factors and potential targets in cancer therapy. In this study, we evaluated Musashi1 (Msi1) targeting as a strategy to treat glioblastoma (GBM); the most aggressive brain tumor type. Msi1 expression levels are often high in GBMs and other tumor types and correlate with poor clinical outcome. Moreover, Msi1 has been implicated in chemo- and radio-resistance. Msi1 modulates a range of cancer relevant processes and pathways and regulates the expression of stem cell markers and oncogenic factors via mRNA translation/stability. To identify Msi1 inhibitors capable of blocking its RNA binding function, we performed a ~ 25,000 compound fluorescence polarization screen. NMR and LSPR were used to confirm direct interaction between Msi1 and luteolin, the leading compound. Luteolin displayed strong interaction with Msi1 RNA binding domain 1 (RBD1). As a likely consequence of this interaction, we observed via western and luciferase assays that luteolin treatment diminished Msi1 positive impact on the expression of pro-oncogenic target genes. We tested the effect of luteolin treatment on GBM cells and showed that it reduced proliferation, cell viability, colony formation, migration and invasion of U251 and U343 GBM cells. Luteolin also decreased the proliferation of patient-derived glioma initiating cells (GICs) and tumor-organoids but did not affect normal astrocytes. Finally, we demonstrated the value of combined treatments with luteolin and olaparib (PARP inhibitor) or ionizing radiation (IR). Our results show that luteolin functions as an inhibitor of Msi1 and demonstrates its potential use in GBM therapy.	
32915464        	Loss of aryl hydrocarbon receptor potentiates FoxM1 signaling to enhance self-renewal of colonic stem and progenitor cells.            	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that senses xenobiotics, diet, and gut microbial-derived metabolites, is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of intestinal biology. However, its effects on the function of colonic stem and progenitor cells remain largely unexplored. Here, we observed that inducible deletion of AhR in Lgr5+ stem cells increases the percentage of colonic stem cells and enhances organoid initiating capacity and growth of sorted stem and progenitor cells, while AhR activation has the opposite effect. Moreover, intestinal-specific AhR knockout increases basal stem cell and crypt injury-induced cell proliferation and promotes colon tumorigenesis in a preclinical colitis-associated tumor model by upregulating FoxM1 signaling. Mechanistically, AhR transcriptionally suppresses FoxM1 expression. Activation of AhR in human organoids recapitulates phenotypes observed in mice, such as reduction in the percentage of colonic stem cells, promotion of stem cell differentiation, and attenuation of FoxM1 signaling. These findings indicate that the AhR-FoxM1 axis, at least in part, mediates colonic stem/progenitor cell behavior.                © 2020 The Authors.

33225975        	Unveiling role of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 as a brake of epithelial stem cell proliferation and a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer.            	Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) mediates pleiotropic functions encompassing cell proliferation, survival, and migration, which become collectively de-regulated in cancer. Information on whether S1PR2 participates in colorectal carcinogenesis/cancer is scanty, and we set out to fill the gap.                We screened expression changes of S1PR2 in human CRC and matched normal mucosa specimens [N = 76]. We compared CRC arising in inflammation-driven and genetically engineered models in wild-type (S1PR2+/+) and S1PR2 deficient (S1PR2-/-) mice. We reconstituted S1PR2 expression in RKO cells and assessed their growth in xenografts. Functionally, we mimicked the ablation of S1PR2 in normal mucosa by treating S1PR2+/+ organoids with JTE013 and characterized intestinal epithelial stem cells isolated from S1PR2-/-Lgr5-EGFP- mice.                S1PR2 expression was lost in 33% of CRC; in 55%, it was significantly decreased, only 12% retaining expression comparable to normal mucosa. Both colitis-induced and genetic Apc+/min mouse models of CRC showed a higher incidence in size and number of carcinomas and/or high-grade adenomas, with increased cell proliferation in S1PR2-/- mice compared to S1PR2+/+ controls. Loss of S1PR2 impaired mucosal regeneration, ultimately promoting the expansion of intestinal stem cells. Whereas its overexpression attenuated cell cycle progression, it reduced the phosphorylation of AKT and augmented the levels of PTEN.                In normal colonic crypts, S1PR2 gains expression along with intestinal epithelial cells differentiation, but not in intestinal stem cells, and contrasts intestinal tumorigenesis by promoting epithelial differentiation, preventing the expansion of stem cells and braking their malignant transformation. Targeting of S1PR2 may be of therapeutic benefit for CRC expressing high Lgr5.

33510789        	MicroRNA-Based Cancer Mortality Risk Scoring System and hTERT Expression in Early-Stage Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.            	We have previously constructed a novel microRNA (miRNA)-based prognostic model and cancer-specific mortality risk score formula to predict survival outcome in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients who are already categorized into "early-stage" by the TNM staging system. A total of 836 early-stage OSCC patients were assigned the mortality risk scores. We evaluated the efficacy of various treatment regimens in terms of survival benefit compared to surgery only in patients stratified into high (risk score ≥0) versus low (risk score <0) mortality risk categories. For the high-risk group, surgery with neck dissection significantly improved the 5-year survival to 75% from 46% with surgery only (p < 0.001); a Cox proportional hazard model on time-to-death demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.37 for surgery with neck dissection (95% CI: 0.2-0.6; p=0.0005). For the low-risk group, surgery only was the treatment of choice associated with 5-year survival benefit. Regardless of treatment selected, those with risk score ≥2 may benefit from additional therapy to prevent cancer relapse. We also identified hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) as a gene target common to the prognostic miRNAs. There was 22-fold increase in the hTERT expression level in patients with risk score ≥2 compared to healthy controls (p < 0.0005). Overexpression of hTERT was also observed in the patient-derived OSCC organoid compared to that of normal organoid. The DNA cancer vaccine that targets hTERT-expressing cells currently undergoing rigorous clinical evaluation for other tumors can be repurposed to prevent cancer recurrence in these high-risk early-stage oral cancer patients.

26831517        	Replacement of Lost Lgr5-Positive Stem Cells through Plasticity of Their Enterocyte-Lineage Daughters.            	Intestinal crypts display robust regeneration upon injury. The relatively rare secretory precursors can replace lost stem cells, but it is unknown if the abundant enterocyte progenitors that express the Alkaline phosphate intestinal (Alpi) gene also have this capacity. We created an Alpi-IRES-CreERT2 (Alpi(CreER)) knockin allele for lineage tracing. Marked clones consist entirely of enterocytes and are all lost from villus tips within days. Genetic fate-mapping of Alpi(+) cells before or during targeted ablation of Lgr5-expressing stem cells generated numerous long-lived crypt-villus "ribbons," indicative of dedifferentiation of enterocyte precursors into Lgr5(+) stems. By single-cell analysis of dedifferentiating enterocytes, we observed the generation of Paneth-like cells and proliferative stem cells. We conclude that the highly proliferative, short-lived enterocyte precursors serve as a large reservoir of potential stem cells during crypt regeneration.

33134178        	Recent Discoveries in the Androgen Receptor Pathway in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.            	The androgen receptor (AR) is the main therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer, because it regulates the growth and progression of prostate cancer cells. Patients may undergo multiple lines of AR-directed treatments, including androgen-deprivation therapy, AR signaling inhibitors (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide), or combinations of these therapies. Yet, tumors inevitably develop resistance to the successive lines of treatment. The diverse mechanisms of resistance include reactivation of the AR and dysregulation of AR cofactors and collaborative transcription factors (TFs). Further elucidating the nexus between the AR and collaborative TFs may reveal new strategies targeting the AR directly or indirectly, such as targeting BET proteins or OCT1. However, appropriate preclinical models will be required to test the efficacy of these approaches. Fortunately, an increasing variety of patient-derived models, such as xenografts and organoids, are being developed for discovery-based research and preclinical drug screening. Here we review the mechanisms of drug resistance in the AR signaling pathway, the intersection with collaborative TFs, and the use of patient-derived models for novel drug discovery.

32792368        	An In Vivo Kras Allelic Series Reveals Distinct Phenotypes of Common Oncogenic Variants.            	KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer, yet there is little understanding of how specific KRAS amino acid changes affect tumor initiation, progression, or therapy response. Using high-fidelity CRISPR-based engineering, we created an allelic series of new LSL-Kras mutant mice, reflecting codon 12 and 13 mutations that are highly prevalent in lung (KRASG12C), pancreas (KRASG12R), and colon (KRASG13D) cancers. Induction of each allele in either the murine colon or pancreas revealed striking quantitative and qualitative differences between KRAS mutants in driving the early stages of transformation. Furthermore, using pancreatic organoid models, we show that KRASG13D mutants are sensitive to EGFR inhibition, whereas KRASG12C-mutant organoids are selectively responsive to covalent G12C inhibitors only when EGFR is suppressed. Together, these new mouse strains provide an ideal platform for investigating KRAS biology in vivo and for developing preclinical precision oncology models of KRAS-mutant pancreas, colon, and lung cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene. Here, we describe new preclinical models that mimic tissue-selective KRAS mutations and show that each mutation has distinct cellular consequences in vivo and carries differential sensitivity to targeted therapeutic agents.See related commentary by Kostyrko and Sweet-Cordero, p. 1626.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1611.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32730753        	Regenerative Reprogramming of the Intestinal Stem Cell State via Hippo Signaling Suppresses Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.            	Although the Hippo transcriptional coactivator YAP is considered oncogenic in many tissues, its roles in intestinal homeostasis and colorectal cancer (CRC) remain controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the Hippo kinases LATS1/2 and MST1/2, which inhibit YAP activity, are required for maintaining Wnt signaling and canonical stem cell function. Hippo inhibition induces a distinct epithelial cell state marked by low Wnt signaling, a wound-healing response, and transcription factor Klf6 expression. Notably, loss of LATS1/2 or overexpression of YAP is sufficient to reprogram Lgr5+ cancer stem cells to this state and thereby suppress tumor growth in organoids, patient-derived xenografts, and mouse models of primary and metastatic CRC. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic deletion of YAP and its paralog TAZ promotes the growth of these tumors. Collectively, our results establish the role of YAP as a tumor suppressor in the adult colon and implicate Hippo kinases as therapeutic vulnerabilities in colorectal malignancies.

32705637        	Generation and Quantitative Imaging of Enteroid Monolayers.            	The intestinal epithelium is a single layer of cells that plays a critical role in digestion, absorbs nutrients from food, and coordinates the delicate interplay between microbes in the gut lumen and the immune system. Epithelial homeostasis is crucial for maintaining health; disruption of homeostasis results in disorders including inflammatory bowel disease and cancer. The advent of 3D intestinal epithelial organoids has greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of epithelial homeostasis and disease. Recently, we developed an enteroid monolayer (2D) culture system that recapitulates important features of 3D organoids and the in vivo intestinal epithelium such as tissue renewal, representation of diverse epithelial cell types, self-organization, and apical-basolateral polarization. Enteroid monolayers are cultured in microtiter plates, enabling high-throughput experiments. Furthermore, their 2D nature makes it easier to distinguish individual cells by fluorescent microscopy, enabling quantitative analysis of single cell behaviors within the epithelial tissue.Here we describe experimental methods for generating enteroid monolayers and computational methods for analyzing immunofluorescence images of enteroid monolayers. We outline experimental methods for generating enteroid monolayers from freshly isolated intestinal crypts, frozen intestinal crypts, and 3D organoids. Fresh crypts are easily obtained from murine or human intestinal samples, and the ability to derive enteroid monolayers from both frozen crypts and 3D organoids enables genetic modification and/or biobanking of patient samples for future studies. We outline computational methods for identifying distinct epithelial cell types (goblet, stem, EdU+) in immunofluorescence images of enteroid monolayers and, importantly, individual nuclei, enabling truly single cell measurements of epithelial cell behaviors to be made. Taken together, these methods will enable detailed studies of epithelial homeostasis and intestinal disease.	
29843359        	Development of an Experimental Model for Analyzing Drug Resistance in Colorectal Cancer.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers, for which combination treatment of chemotherapy is employed. However, most patients develop drug resistance during the course of treatment. To clarify the mechanisms of drug resistance, various research models have been developed. Recently, we established a human CRC patients-derived three-dimensional (3D) culture system using an air-liquid interface organoid method. It contained numerous cancer stem cells and showed resistance to 5-fluorouracil and Irinotecan. In this review, we introduce conventional and our established models for studying drug resistance in CRC.	
29930978        	Human Fetal-Derived Enterospheres Provide Insights on Intestinal Development and a Novel Model to Study Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC).            	Untreated necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) can lead to massive inflammation resulting in intestinal necrosis with a high mortality rate in preterm infants. Limited access to human samples and relevant experimental models have hampered progress in NEC pathogenesis. Earlier evidence has suggested that bacterial colonization of an immature and developing intestine can lead to an abnormally high inflammatory response to bacterial bioproducts. The aim of our study was to use human fetal organoids to gain insights into NEC pathogenesis.                RNA sequencing analysis was performed to compare patterns of gene expression in human fetal-derived enterospheres (FEnS) and adult-derived enterospheres (AEnS). Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using computational techniques for dimensional reduction, clustering, and gene set enrichment. Unsupervised cluster analysis, Gene Ontology, and gene pathway analysis were used to predict differences between gene expression of samples. Cell monolayers derived from FEnS and AEnS were evaluated for epithelium function and responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide and commensal bacteria.                Based on gene expression patterns, FEnS clustered according to their developmental age in 2 distinct groups: early and late FEnS, with the latter more closely resembling AEnS. Genes involved in maturation, gut barrier function, and innate immunity were responsible for these differences. FEnS-derived monolayers exposed to either lipopolysaccharide or commensal Escherichia coli showed that late FEnS activated gene expression of key inflammatory cytokines, whereas early FEnS monolayers did not, owing to decreased expression of nuclear factor-κB-associated machinery.                Our results provide insights into processes underlying human intestinal development and support the use of FEnS as a relevant human preclinical model for NEC.

33184339        	Evaluation of chemotherapy and P2Et extract combination in ex-vivo derived tumor mammospheres from breast cancer patients.            	The main cause of death by cancer is metastasis rather than local complications of primary tumors. Recent studies suggest that breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), retains the ability to self-renew and differentiate to repopulate the entire tumor, also, they have been associated with resistance to chemotherapy and tumor recurrence, even after tumor resection. Chemotherapy has been implicated in the induction of resistant phenotypes with highly metastatic potential. Naturally occurring compounds, especially phytochemicals such as P2Et, can target different populations of cancer cells as well as BCSC, favoring the activation of immune response via immunogenic tumor death. Here, we evaluated the presence of BCSC as well as markers related to drug resistance in tumors obtained from 78 patients who had received (or not) chemotherapy before surgery. We evaluated the ex vivo response of patient tumor-derived organoids (or mammospheres) to chemotherapy alone or in combination with P2Et. A xenotransplant model engrafted with MDA-MB-468 was used to evaluate in vivo the activity of P2Et, in this model P2Et delay tumor growth. We show that patients with luminal and TNBC, and those who received neoadjuvant therapy before surgery have a higher frequency of BCSC. Further, the treatment with P2Et in mammospheres and human breast cancer cell lines improve the in vitro tumor death and decrease its viability and proliferation together with the release of immunogenic signals. P2Et could be a good co-adjuvant in antitumor therapy in patients, retarding the tumor growth by enabling the activation of the immune response.	
31696117        	Cancer Sample Biobanking at the Next Level: Combining Tissue With Living Cell Repositories to Promote Precision Medicine.            	Biorespositories of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or fresh frozen human tissues from malignant diseases generated as integral part of the diagnostic workup in many pathology departments have been pivotal resources for translational cancer studies. However, such tissue biobanks have traditionally contained only non-viable specimens and thus cannot enable functional assays for the discovery and validation of therapeutic targets or the assessment of drug responses and resistance to treatment. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a next-generation comprehensive biobanking platform that includes the generation of patient-derived in vitro cell models from colorectal, pancreatic and kidney cancers among others. As such patient-derived cell (PDC) models retain important features of the original human tumors, they have emerged as relevant tools for more dynamic clinical and experimental analyses of cancer. Here, we describe details of the complex processes of acquisition and processing of patient-derived samples, propagation, annotation, characterization and distribution of resulting cell models and emphasize the requirements of quality assurance, organizational considerations and investment into resources. Taken together, we show how clinical tissue collections can be taken to the next level thus promising major new opportunities for understanding and treating cancer in the context of precision medicine.

31526907        	Loss of Pancreatic E-Cadherin Causes Pancreatitis-Like Changes and Contributes to Carcinogenesis.            	E-cadherin (Cdh1) is a key molecule for adherence required for maintenance of structural homeostasis. Loss of E-cadherin leads to poor prognosis and the development of resistance to chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Here, we evaluated the physiological and pathologic roles of E-cadherin in the pancreas.                We crossbred Ptf1a-Cre mice with Cdh1f/f mice to examine the physiological roles of E-cadherin in the pancreas. In addition, we crossbred these mice with LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice (PKC) to investigate the pathologic roles of E-cadherin. We also generated a tamoxifen-inducible system (Ptf1a-CreERT model). Organoids derived from these models using lentiviral transduction were analyzed for immunohistochemical features. Established cell lines from these organoids were analyzed for migratory and invasive activities as well as gene expression by complementary DNA microarray analyses.                None of the Ptf1a-Cre mice crossbred with Cdh1f/f mice survived for more than 28 days. We observed aberrant epithelial tubules that resembled the structure of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia after postnatal day 6, showing features of pancreatitis. All of the PKC mice died within 10 days. We observed tumorigenicity with increasing stroma-like aggressive tumors. Ptf1a-CreERT models showed that deletion of E-cadherin led to earlier pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm formation. Cells established from PKC organoids had greater migratory and invasive activities, and these allograft tumors showed a poorly differentiated phenotype. Gene expression analysis indicated that Hdac1 was up-regulated in PKC cell lines and a histone deacetylase 1 inhibitor suppressed PKC cell proliferation.                Under physiological conditions, E-cadherin is important for maintaining the tissue homeostasis of the pancreas. Under pathologic conditions with mutational Kras activation, E-cadherin plays an important role in tumor formation via the acquisition of tumorigenic activity.

32064165        	Conditionally reprogrammed colorectal cancer cells combined with mouse avatars identify synergy between EGFR and MEK or CDK4/6 inhibitors.            	Preclinical models, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid and primary cell culture, are essential for studies of cancer cell biology and facilitate translational research and individualization of therapy. We explored the optimum preclinical model by modifying the conventional conditional reprogramming (CR) system followed by screening effective targeted drug combinations against colorectal cancer (CRC). By modifying the ingredients of the culture medium used in a conventional CR system, a novel individualized CR system (termed i-CR) was established. Tumor samples from CRC patients were collected and PDX models were derived followed by high-throughput i-CR drug screening and validation of the effective targeted drug combinations. The i-CR system selectively expanded tumor cells rather than normal epithelial cells and facilitated high-throughput drug screening when combined with high-content imaging and quantitative analysis of cell proliferation. Using inhibitors targeting multiple signaling pathways identified by high-throughput i-CR drug screening, we discovered that inhibition of the EGFR and MEK or CDK4/6 pathways exerted a synergistic inhibitory effect against CRC, and we noted super-synergistic effects when EGFR, MEK, and CDK4/6 inhibitors were used simultaneously. These data were validated using paired PDX models, which showed marked inhibition of tumor growth. The novel i-CR system combined with PDX models will enable individualization of therapy and drug discovery, and strategies combining EGFR, MEK, and CDK4/6 inhibitors warrant clinical validation.

32606358        	CDK5RAP3 as tumour suppressor negatively regulates self-renewal and invasion and is regulated by ERK1/2 signalling in human gastric cancer.            	Toward identifying new strategies to target gastric cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), we evaluated the function of the tumour suppressor CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 3 (CDK5RAP3) in gastric CSC maintenance.                We examined the expression of CDK5RAP3 and CD44 in gastric cancer patients. The function and mechanisms of CDK5RAP3 were checked in human and mouse gastric cancer cell lines and in mouse xenograft.                We show that CDK5RAP3 is weakly expressed in gastric CSCs and is negatively correlated with the gastric CSC marker CD44. CDK5RAP3 overexpression decreased expression of CSC markers, spheroid formation, invasion and migration, and reversed chemoresistance in gastric CSCs in vitro and vivo. CDK5RAP3 expression was found to be regulated by extracellular-related kinase (ERK) signalling. ERK inhibitors decreased spheroid formation, migration and invasion, and the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins in both GA cells and organoids derived from a genetically engineered mouse model of GA. Finally, CDK5RAP3 expression was associated with reduced lymph-node metastasis and better prognosis, even in the presence of high expression of the EMT transcription factor Snail, among patients with CD44-positive GA.                Our results demonstrate that CDK5RAP3 is suppressed by ERK signalling and negatively regulates the self-renewal and EMT of gastric CSCs.	
30211119        	The Mouse Hospital and Its Integration in Ultra-Precision Approaches to Cancer Care.            	Precision medicine holds real promise for the treatment of cancer. Adapting therapeutic strategies so patients receive individualized treatment protocols, will transform how diseases like cancer are managed. Already, molecular profiling technologies have provided unprecedented capacity to characterize tumors, yet the ability to translate this to actionable outcome in the clinic is limited. To enable real time translation of personalized therapeutic approaches to patient care in a co-clinical manner will require the adoption and integration of approaches that facilitate modeling of patient disease. The Mouse Hospital represents an approach that is ideally suited to pre- and co-clinical evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies for clinical care. Patient derived xenograft (PDX) technologies and in situ tumor modeling approaches using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) already have a proven capacity to mimic human tumor responses, and their application can deliver invaluable insights into appropriate clinical approaches for individual patients by mirroring human clinical trials using a Co-Clinical Trial project and Mouse Hospital infrastructure. Additionally, the integration of the Mouse Hospital with other emerging technologies for the application of precision medicines, including organoid technologies, provides a platform that enables medical centers to truly reap the benefits that precision medicine has to offer.	
27447549        	Oncogenic Ras triggers hyperproliferation and impairs polarized colonic morphogenesis by autocrine ErbB3 signaling.            	Here we study the effects of inducible oncogenic K-Ras (G12V) expression on the polarized morphogenesis of colonic epithelial cells. We provide evidence that the autocrine production of heregulins, ligands for the ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase, is responsible for the hyperproliferation and aberrant 3D morphogenesis upon oncogenic K-Ras expression. This is in line with results obtained in primary intestinal organoid cultures, in which exogenous heregulin is shown to interfere with normal tissue architecture. Importantly, ErbB3 inhibition and heregulin gene silencing rescued K-RasG12V-induced features of cell transformation. Together with the increased ErbB3 positivity detected in human high-grade primary colorectal cancers, our findings provide support for an autocrine signaling loop engaged by oncogenic K-Ras involving ErbB3 that contributes to the dedifferentiation of the intestinal epithelium during tumor initiation and progression.

29523594        	Dual inhibition of AKT-mTOR and AR signaling by targeting HDAC3 in PTEN- or SPOP-mutated prostate cancer.            	AKT-mTOR and androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways are aberrantly activated in prostate cancer due to frequent PTEN deletions or SPOP mutations. A clinical barrier is that targeting one of them often activates the other. Here, we demonstrate that HDAC3 augments AKT phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells and its overexpression correlates with AKT phosphorylation in patient samples. HDAC3 facilitates lysine-63-chain polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of AKT, and this effect is mediated by AKT deacetylation at lysine 14 and 20 residues and HDAC3 interaction with the scaffold protein APPL1. Conditional homozygous deletion of Hdac3 suppresses prostate tumorigenesis and progression by concomitant blockade of AKT and AR signaling in the Pten knockout mouse model. Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC3 using a selective HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966 inhibits growth of both PTEN-deficient and SPOP-mutated prostate cancer cells in culture, patient-derived organoids and xenografts in mice. Our study identifies HDAC3 as a common upstream activator of AKT and AR signaling and reveals that dual inhibition of AKT and AR pathways is achievable by single-agent targeting of HDAC3 in prostate cancer.                © 2018 The Authors.

27068235        	Ablating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in CD11c+ cells perturbs intestinal epithelium development and intestinal immunity.            	Diet and microbiome derived indole derivatives are known to activate the ligand induced transcription factor, the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR). While the current understanding of AhR biology has confirmed its role in mucosal lymphocytes, its function in intestinal antigen presenting cells (APCs) is poorly understood. Here, we report that Cre-mediated deletion of AhR in CD11c-expressing cells in C57/BL6 mice is associated with altered intestinal epithelial morphogenesis in vivo. Moreover, when co-cultured with AhR-deficient DCs ex vivo, intestinal organoids showed reduced SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 and increased Mucin 2 expression, which correlates with reduced Paneth cells and increased goblet cell differentiation, similar to the data obtained in vivo. Further, characterization of intestinal APC subsets, devoid of AhR, revealed an expression pattern associated with aberrant intrinsic Wnt pathway regulation. At a functional level, the loss of AhR in APCs resulted in a dysfunctional epithelial barrier, associated with a more aggressive chemically induced colitis compared to wild type animals. Our results are consistent with a model whereby the AhR signalling pathway may participate in the regulation of innate immunity through intestinal epithelium development and mucosal immunity.	
30364132        	Depletion of Lipid Efflux Pump ABCG1 Triggers the Intracellular Accumulation of Extracellular Vesicles and Reduces Aggregation and Tumorigenesis of Metastatic Cancer Cells.            	The ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) is a cholesterol lipid efflux pump whose role in tumor growth has been largely unknown. Our transcriptomics revealed that ABCG1 was powerfully expressed in rapidly metastatic, aggregative colon cancer cells, in all the ABC transporter family members. Coincidently, genetic amplification of ABCG1 is found in 10-35% of clinical samples of metastatic cancer cases. Expression of ABCG1 was further elevated in three-dimensional tumoroids (tumor organoids) within stemness-enhancing tumor milieu, whereas depletion of ABCG1 lowered cellular aggregation and tumoroid growth in vitro as well as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α in cancer cells around the central necrotic areas in tumors in vivo. Notably, depletion of ABCG1 triggered the intracellular accumulation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and regression of tumoroids. Collectively, these data suggest that ABCG1 plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis in metastatic cancer and that depletion of ABCG1 triggers tumor regression with the accumulation of EVs and their derivatives and cargos, implicating a novel ABCG1-targeting therapeutic strategy by which redundant and toxic substances may be accumulated in tumors leading to their regression.	
26026391        	KIT Signaling Promotes Growth of Colon Xenograft Tumors in Mice and Is Up-Regulated in a Subset of Human Colon Cancers.            	Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors have advanced colon cancer treatment. We investigated the role of the RTK KIT in development of human colon cancer.                An array of 137 patient-derived colon tumors and their associated xenografts were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to measure levels of KIT and its ligand KITLG. KIT and/or KITLG was stably knocked down by expression of small hairpin RNAs from lentiviral vectors in DLD1, HT29, LS174T, and COLO320 DM colon cancer cell lines, and in UM-COLON#8 and POP77 xenografts; cells transduced with only vector were used as controls. Cells were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, single-cell gene expression analysis, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical, immunoblot, and functional assays. Xenograft tumors were grown from control and KIT-knockdown DLD1 and UM-COLON#8 cells in immunocompromised mice and compared. Some mice were given the RTK inhibitor imatinib after injection of cancer cells; tumor growth was measured based on bioluminescence. We assessed tumorigenicity using limiting dilution analysis.                KIT and KITLG were expressed heterogeneously by a subset of human colon tumors. Knockdown of KIT decreased proliferation of colon cancer cell lines and growth of xenograft tumors in mice compared with control cells. KIT knockdown cells had increased expression of enterocyte markers, decreased expression of cycling genes, and, unexpectedly, increased expression of LGR5 associated genes. No activating mutations in KIT were detected in DLD1, POP77, or UM-COLON#8 cells. However, KITLG-knockdown DLD1 cells formed smaller xenograft tumors than control cells. Gene expression analysis of single CD44(+) cells indicated that KIT can promote growth via KITLG autocrine and/or paracrine signaling. Imatinib inhibited growth of KIT(+) colon cancer organoids in culture and growth of xenograft tumors in mice. Cancer cells with endogenous KIT expression were more tumorigenic in mice.                KIT and KITLG are expressed by a subset of human colon tumors. KIT signaling promotes growth of colon cancer cells and organoids in culture and xenograft tumors in mice via its ligand, KITLG, in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Patients with KIT-expressing colon tumors can benefit from KIT RTK inhibitors.                Copyright © 2015 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
24197660        	Upregulated WAVE3 expression is essential for TGF-β-mediated EMT and metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer cells.            	Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Metastasis accounts for the death of ~90 % of these patients, yet the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly defined. WAVE3 belongs to the WASP/WAVE family of actin-binding proteins that play essential roles in regulating cell morphology, actin polymerization, cytoskeleton remodeling, cell motility, and invasion. Accordingly, we demonstrated previously that WAVE3 promotes the acquisition of invasive and metastatic phenotypes by human breast cancers. Herein, we show that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) selectively and robustly induced the expression of WAVE3 in metastatic breast cancer cells, but not in their nonmetastatic counterparts. Moreover, the induction of WAVE3 expression in human and mouse triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) by TGF-β likely reflects its coupling to microRNA expression via a Smad2- and β3 integrin-dependent mechanism. We further demonstrate the requirement for WAVE3 expression in mediating the initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs stimulated by TGF-β. Indeed, stable depletion of WAVE3 expression in human TNBC cells prevented TGF-β from inducing EMT programs and from stimulating the proliferation, migration, and the formation of lamellipodia in metastatic TNBC cells. Lastly, we observed WAVE3 deficiency to abrogate the outgrowth of TNBC cell organoids in 3-dimensional organotypic cultures as well as to decrease the growth and metastasis of 4T1 tumors produced in syngeneic Balb/C mice. Indeed, WAVE3 deficiency significantly reduced the presence of sarcomatoid morphologies indicative of EMT phenotypes in pulmonary TNBC tumors as compared to those detected in their parental counterparts. Collectively, these findings indicate the necessity for WAVE3 expression and activity during EMT programs stimulated by TGF-β; they also suggest that measures capable of inactivating WAVE3 may play a role in alleviating metastasis stimulated by TGF-β.	
31212370        	Distinct expression patterns of SULT2B1b in human prostate epithelium.            	SULT2B1b (sulfotransferase family cytosolic 2B member 1b) catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of substrates such as cholesterol and oxysterols. Our laboratory has previously shown that SULT2B1b inhibition modulates androgen receptor signaling and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. However, the functions of SULT2B1b in the prostate remain poorly understood.                We characterized the expression pattern of SULT2B1b in human benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) as well as prostate cancer to determine the relationship between SULT2B1b and prostate diseases, using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, immunoblot, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.                SULT2B1b was strongly detected in the prostate epithelium but was absent in the stroma. Significantly lower SULT2B1b was found in primary cancer cells compared with adjacent normal epithelial cells. SULT2B1b further decreased in metastatic cancer cells. Most interestingly, we found, for the first time, that SULT2B1b was much more concentrated in the luminal layer than in the basal layer in both normal prostate and BPH samples. The stronger presence of SULT2B1b in luminal epithelial cells was confirmed by costaining with luminal and basal markers and in sorted paired luminal and basal cells. SULT2B1b expression was induced with prostate organoid differentiation.                SULT2B1b inversely correlates with prostate cancer status, with the highest level in the normal epithelium and lowest in the advanced metastatic prostate cancer. Furthermore, SULT2B1b is mostly located within the luminal layer of the prostate epithelium, suggesting that it may be implicated in luminal differentiation.                © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
33565799        	Inhibition of Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase Induces the Unfolded Protein Response in Pancreatic Tumors and Suppresses Their Growth.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and there is an urgent need for effective therapies. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is an enzyme localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and generates monounsaturated fatty acid from saturated fatty acid. In this study, we examined the role of SCD in pancreatic cancer.                We isolated epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive pancreatic tumors from the Pdx1Cre;LSL-KrasG12D mouse and formed organoids in Matrigel. Using a SCD inhibitor, A939572, we tested its effects on growth and cell death in tumor organoids, tumors developed in the Pdx1Cre;LSL-KrasG12D mouse, and a human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line, PANC-1.                A939572 treatment rapidly induced degeneration of mouse tumor organoids and activated the unfolded protein response (UPR). Cotreatment of oleic acid, but not stearic acid, reduced the UPR in the organoids and rescued the inhibitory effect of the SCD inhibitor on their growth. Administration of A939572 to Pdx1Cre;LSL-KrasG12D mice caused cell death in early pancreatic tumors, but not in acini or islets. The SCD inhibitor induced the UPR in PANC-1 and suppressed their growth but did not induce cell death.                The inhibition of the SCD enzyme causes an UPR and cell death in early pancreatic tumors.                Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.	
32455578        	Targeting Protein Synthesis in Colorectal Cancer.            	Under physiological conditions, protein synthesis controls cell growth and survival and is strictly regulated. Deregulation of protein synthesis is a frequent event in cancer. The majority of mutations found in colorectal cancer (CRC), including alterations in the WNT pathway as well as activation of RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT and, subsequently, mTOR signaling, lead to deregulation of the translational machinery. Besides mutations in upstream signaling pathways, deregulation of global protein synthesis occurs through additional mechanisms including altered expression or activity of initiation and elongation factors (e.g., eIF4F, eIF2α/eIF2B, eEF2) as well as upregulation of components involved in ribosome biogenesis and factors that control the adaptation of translation in response to stress (e.g., GCN2). Therefore, influencing mechanisms that control mRNA translation may open a therapeutic window for CRC. Over the last decade, several potential therapeutic strategies targeting these alterations have been investigated and have shown promising results in cell lines, intestinal organoids, and mouse models. Despite these encouraging in vitro results, patients have not clinically benefited from those advances so far. In this review, we outline the mechanisms that lead to deregulated mRNA translation in CRC and highlight recent progress that has been made in developing therapeutic strategies that target these mechanisms for tumor therapy.	
20034083        	Systematized organoid epidermal nevus with eccrine differentiation, multiple facial and oral congenital scars, gingival synechiae, and blepharophimosis: a novel epidermal nevus syndrome.            	Epidermal nevus syndrome is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous group of mosaic conditions characterized by the concurrence of extensive epidermal nevus with additional cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations. This term groups together well-characterized clinical entities, as well as dozens of apparently unique associations, which need further delineation. We report on a 23-year-old woman presenting the previously undescribed combination of widespread eccrine proliferation, multiple facial and oral pox-like lesions, gingival synechiae, blepharophimosis, body asymmetry, and mental retardation. The patient has a healthy monozygotic twin. The eccrine proliferation is intermingled with areas of unaffected skin with a linear/segmental distribution on the limbs. The clinical presentation of such a complex phenotype fits well with the genetic mosaicism theory. The histologic findings, consisting of proliferation of immature to well-formed eccrine duct-like structures located in the deep dermis and interspersed with an abundant fibrous stroma constituted of horizontally oriented collagen fibers, seem a possible hallmark of this condition.	
33665254        	Identification of new fisetin analogs as kinase inhibitors: Data on synthesis and anti-skin cancer activities evaluation.            	This article contains supplemental datasets of the recently published related research article "Synthesis, Inverse Docking-Assisted Identification and in vitro Biological Characterization of Flavonol-based Analogs of Fisetin as c-Kit, CDK2 and mTOR Inhibitors against Melanoma and Non-melanoma Skin Cancers" by Roy et al., [1]. It provides in-depth data not included in the original co-submission on the biophysical, molecular docking, and biological characterization of newly synthesized flavonol-based analogs of fisetin, a natural dietary small molecule with anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. These synthetic small molecules were investigated as new, potential single and/or multi-kinase inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2), receptor tyrosine kinases (c-KITs), and mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) targets, potentially active against melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancers. Furthermore, this data-in-brief article comprises additional sets of results on several aspects of the properties of the dual and multiple kinase inhibitor compounds' effects that were not presented in the associated article, including the activated targets that are dysregulated in skin cancers; the effects on markers of apoptosis; on colony formation; and in scratch wound healing assays. The study has identified a panel of novel fisetin analogs that are either single- or multi-kinase inhibitors, which may be further developed as active for the treatment of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. The dataset presented herein will be utilized for additional studies aiming to establish a biological platform to steer for predictive and experimental screening of novel flavonoids and analogs in relevant organoids, humanized animal models and in vivo disease models. The present results should also serve as a key stepping-stone towards enabling target-structure-based design, synthesis and initial testing of novel analogs or derivatives of fisetin. The current study may eventually lead to the development of safe, promising and preclinical candidate entities for treatment of skin and other forms of cancers as well as various other human diseases, which can possibly add to the general armamentarium of promising and safe drugs for health promotion.	
33479180        	A genome-scale CRISPR screen reveals factors regulating Wnt-dependent renewal of mouse gastric epithelial cells.            	An ability to safely harness the powerful regenerative potential of adult stem cells for clinical applications is critically dependent on a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms regulating their activity. Epithelial organoid cultures accurately recapitulate many features of in vivo stem cell-driven epithelial renewal, providing an excellent ex vivo platform for interrogation of key regulatory mechanisms. Here, we employed a genome-scale clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) knockout (KO) screening assay using mouse gastric epithelial organoids to identify modulators of Wnt-driven stem cell-dependent epithelial renewal in the gastric mucosa. In addition to known Wnt pathway regulators, such as Apc, we found that KO of Alk, Bclaf3, or Prkra supports the Wnt independent self-renewal of gastric epithelial cells ex vivo. In adult mice, expression of these factors is predominantly restricted to non-Lgr5-expressing stem cell zones above the gland base, implicating a critical role for these factors in suppressing self-renewal or promoting differentiation of gastric epithelia. Notably, we found that Alk inhibits Wnt signaling by phosphorylating the tyrosine of Gsk3β, while Bclaf3 and Prkra suppress regenerating islet-derived (Reg) genes by regulating the expression of epithelial interleukins. Therefore, Alk, Bclaf3, and Prkra may suppress stemness/proliferation and function as novel regulators of gastric epithelial differentiation.                Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

26630674        	Segmentation of Image Data from Complex Organotypic 3D Models of Cancer Tissues with Markov Random Fields.            	Organotypic, three dimensional (3D) cell culture models of epithelial tumour types such as prostate cancer recapitulate key aspects of the architecture and histology of solid cancers. Morphometric analysis of multicellular 3D organoids is particularly important when additional components such as the extracellular matrix and tumour microenvironment are included in the model. The complexity of such models has so far limited their successful implementation. There is a great need for automatic, accurate and robust image segmentation tools to facilitate the analysis of such biologically relevant 3D cell culture models. We present a segmentation method based on Markov random fields (MRFs) and illustrate our method using 3D stack image data from an organotypic 3D model of prostate cancer cells co-cultured with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The 3D segmentation output suggests that these cell types are in physical contact with each other within the model, which has important implications for tumour biology. Segmentation performance is quantified using ground truth labels and we show how each step of our method increases segmentation accuracy. We provide the ground truth labels along with the image data and code. Using independent image data we show that our segmentation method is also more generally applicable to other types of cellular microscopy and not only limited to fluorescence microscopy.	
25200184        	Induction of integrin α2 in a highly bone metastatic human prostate cancer cell line: roles of RANKL and AR under three-dimensional suspension culture.            	Prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis can be markedly enhanced by increased receptor activator of NF kappa-B ligand (RANKL) expression in PCa cells. Molecular mechanisms that account for the increased predilection of PCa for bone include increased bone turnover, promotion of PCa cell growth and survival in the bone environment, and recruitment of bystander dormant cells to participate in bone metastasis. The current study tests the hypothesis that PCa cells acquire high adhesion to bone matrix proteins, which controls PCa bone colonization, under the RANKL/RANK and AR axes.                We used a highly bone metastatic RANKL-overexpressing LNCaP PCa cell line, LNCaP(RANKL), as a model to pursue the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased adhesion of PCa cells to collagens. A three-dimensional (3-D) suspension PCa organoid model was developed. The functions of integrin α2 in cell adhesion and survival were evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot. AR expression and functionality were compared in 2-D monolayer versus 3-D suspension cultures using AR promoter- and PSA promoter-luciferase activity. AR role in cell adhesion was assessed using an adhesion assay.                LNCaP(RANKL) cells were shown to adhere tightly to ColI matrix through increased α2 integrin expression. This increased adhesion, concomitant with activation of the FAK and Akt pathways, was further enhanced by culturing LNCaP(RANKL) cells in 3-D suspension. Under the influence of 3-D suspension culture, AR was restored in LNCaP(RANKL) cells via downregulation of AP-4 transcription factor, and supported increased α2 integrin expression and adhesion to ColI.                3-D suspension culture and in vivo PCa tumor growth restore AR through downregulation of AP-4, enhancing integrin α2 expression and adhesion to ColI which is rich in bone matrices. The interactions of PCa with ColI, mediated by integrin α2 and AR expression, could be a key molecular event accounting for PCa bone metastasis.	
32133604        	IGF-binding proteins 3 and 4 are regulators of sprouting angiogenesis.            	We have previously identified insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) as essential proteins for tip cell maintenance and sprouting angiogenesis. In this study, we aim to identify other IGF family members involved in endothelial sprouting angiogenesis.                Effects on sprouting were analyzed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using the spheroid-based sprouting model, and were quantified as mean number of sprouts per spheroid and average sprout length. RNA silencing technology was used to knockdown gene expression. Recombinant forms of the ligands (IGF1 and IGF2, insulin) and the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP) 3 and 4 were used to induce excess effects. Effects on the tip cell phenotype were analyzed by measuring the fraction of CD34+ tip cells using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry in a 3D angiogenesis model. Experiments were performed in the presence and absence of serum.                Knockdown of IGF2 inhibited sprouting in HUVECs, in particular when cultured in the absence of serum, suggesting that components in serum influence the signaling of IGF2 in angiogenesis in vitro. We then determined the effects of IGFBP3 and IGFBP4, which are both present in serum, on IGF2-IGF1R signaling in sprouting angiogenesis in the absence of serum: knockdown of IGFBP3 significantly reduced sprouting angiogenesis, whereas knockdown of IGFBP4 resulted in increased sprouting angiogenesis in both flow cytometry analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of the 3D angiogenesis model. Other IGF family members except INSR did not affect IGF2-IGF1R signaling.                Serum components and IGF binding proteins regulate IGF2 effects on sprouting angiogenesis. Whereas IGFBP3 acts as co-factor for IGF2-IGF1R binding, IGFBP4 inhibits IGF2 signaling.	
31196138        	Antitumor activity of dual blockade of PD-L1 and MEK in NSCLC patients derived three-dimensional spheroid cultures.            	Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs are effective as monotherapy in a proportion of NSCLC patients and there is a strong rationale for combining them with targeted therapy. Inhibition of MAPK pathway may have pleiotropic effects on the microenvironment. This work investigates the efficacy of combining MEK and PD-L1 inhibition in pre-clinical and ex-vivo NSCLC models.                We studied the effects of MEK inhibitors (MEK-I) on PD-L1 and MCH-I protein expression and cytokine production in vitro in NSCLC cell lines and in PBMCs from healthy donors and NSCLC patients, the efficacy of combining MEK-I with anti-PD-L1 antibody in ex-vivo human spheroid cultures obtained from fresh biopsies from NSCLC patients in terms of cell growth arrest, cytokine production and T-cell activation by flow cytometry.                MEK-I modulates in-vitro the immune micro-environment through a transcriptionally decrease of PD-L1 expression, enhance of MHC-I expression on tumor cells, increase of the production of several cytokines, like IFNγ, IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα. These effects trigger a more permissive anti-tumor immune reaction, recruiting immune cells to the tumor sites. We confirmed these data on ex-vivo human spheroids, showing a synergism of MEK and PD-L1 inhibition as result of both direct cancer cell toxicity of MEK-I and its immune-stimulatory effect on cytokine secretion profile of cancer cells and PBMCs with the induction of the ones that sustain an immune-reactive and inflammatory micro-environment.                Our work shows the biological rationale for combining immunotherapy with MEK-I in a reproducible ex-vivo 3D-culture model, useful to predict sensitivity of patients to such therapies.	
33359449        	SIRT1 inhibitors mitigate radiation-induced GI syndrome by enhancing intestinal-stem-cell survival.            	High-dose radiation exposure induces gastrointestinal (GI) stem cell death, resulting in denudation of the intestinal mucosa and lethality from GI syndrome, for which there is currently no effective therapy. Studying an intestinal organoid-based functional model, we found that Sirtuin1(SIRT1) inhibition through genetic knockout or pharmacologic inhibition significantly improved mouse and human intestinal organoid survival after irradiation. Remarkably, mice administered with two doseages of SIRT1 inhibitors at 24 and 96 h after lethal irradiation promoted Lgr5+ intestinal stem cell and crypt recovery, with improved mouse survival (88.89% of mice in the treated group vs. 0% of mice in the control group). Moreover, our data revealed that SIRT1 inhibition increased p53 acetylation, resulting in the stabilization of p53 and likely contributing to the survival of intestinal epithelial cells post-radiation. These results demonstrate that SIRT1 inhibitors are effective clinical countermeasures to mitigate GI toxicity from potentially lethal radiation exposure.

24816253        	Whole-genome sequencing and comprehensive molecular profiling identify new driver mutations in gastric cancer.            	Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous disease with diverse molecular and histological subtypes. We performed whole-genome sequencing in 100 tumor-normal pairs, along with DNA copy number, gene expression and methylation profiling, for integrative genomic analysis. We found subtype-specific genetic and epigenetic perturbations and unique mutational signatures. We identified previously known (TP53, ARID1A and CDH1) and new (MUC6, CTNNA2, GLI3, RNF43 and others) significantly mutated driver genes. Specifically, we found RHOA mutations in 14.3% of diffuse-type tumors but not in intestinal-type tumors (P < 0.001). The mutations clustered in recurrent hotspots affecting functional domains and caused defective RHOA signaling, promoting escape from anoikis in organoid cultures. The top perturbed pathways in gastric cancer included adherens junction and focal adhesion, in which RHOA and other mutated genes we identified participate as key players. These findings illustrate a multidimensional and comprehensive genomic landscape that highlights the molecular complexity of gastric cancer and provides a road map to facilitate genome-guided personalized therapy.	
21813469        	Intestinal renin-angiotensin system is stimulated after deletion of Lkb1.            	LKB1 is a serine-threonine kinase, mutation of which can lead to the development of multiple benign intestinal hamartomas (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). In this study, the authors investigate the mechanisms underlying this phenotype by exploring the transcriptional changes associated with Lkb1 deletion in intestinal epithelium.                The authors used mice with Lkb1 deleted in the intestinal epithelium using a Cyp1a1-specific inducible Cre recombinase and used Affymetrix (Santa Clara, California, USA) microarray analysis to examine the transcriptional changes occurring immediately after Lkb1 loss. The authors also generated crypt-villus organoid culture to analyse Lkb1 role in intestinal responses to exogenous stimuli.                Affymetrix analysis identified the most significant change to be in Ren1 expression, a gene encoding a protease involved in angiotensinogen processing. Lkb1 deletion also enhanced ACE expression and subsequently angiotensin II (AngII) production in the mouse intestine. Intestinal apoptosis induced by Lkb1 deficiency was suppressed by ACE inhibitor captopril. Lkb1-deficient intestinal epithelium showed dynamic changes in AngII receptor type 1, suggesting a possible compensatory response to elevated AngII levels. A similar reduction in epithelial AngII receptor type 1 was also observed in human Peutz-Jeghers syndrome tumours contrasting with high expression of the receptor in the tumour stroma. Mechanistically, the authors showed two pieces of data that position Lkb1 in renin expression regulation, and they implied the importance of Lkb1 in linking cell responses with nutrient levels. First, the authors showed that Lkb1 deletion in isolated epithelial organoid culture resulted in renin upregulation only when the organoids were challenged with external cues such as AngII; second, that renin upregulation was dependent upon the MEK/ERK pathway in a circadian fashion and corresponded to active feeding time when nutrient levels were high.                Taken together, these data reveal a novel role for Lkb1 in regulation of the gastrointestinal renin-angiotensin system.	
25387856        	Prediction of individual response to anticancer therapy: historical and future perspectives.            	Since the introduction of chemotherapy for cancer treatment in the early 20th century considerable efforts have been made to maximize drug efficiency and at the same time minimize side effects. As there is a great interpatient variability in response to chemotherapy, the development of predictive biomarkers is an ambitious aim for the rapidly growing research area of personalized molecular medicine. The individual prediction of response will improve treatment and thus increase survival and life quality of patients. In the past, cell cultures were used as in vitro models to predict in vivo response to chemotherapy. Several in vitro chemosensitivity assays served as tools to measure miscellaneous endpoints such as DNA damage, apoptosis and cytotoxicity or growth inhibition. Twenty years ago, the development of high-throughput technologies, e.g. cDNA microarrays enabled a more detailed analysis of drug responses. Thousands of genes were screened and expression levels were correlated to drug responses. In addition, mutation analysis became more and more important for the prediction of therapeutic success. Today, as research enters the area of -omics technologies, identification of signaling pathways is a tool to understand molecular mechanism underlying drug resistance. Combining new tissue models, e.g. 3D organoid cultures with modern technologies for biomarker discovery will offer new opportunities to identify new drug targets and in parallel predict individual responses to anticancer therapy. In this review, we present different currently used chemosensitivity assays including 2D and 3D cell culture models and several -omics approaches for the discovery of predictive biomarkers. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of these assays and biomarkers to predict the clinical outcome of individual patients and future perspectives.	
26701265        	Differentiation of mammary tumors and reduction in metastasis upon Malat1 lncRNA loss.            	Genome-wide analyses have identified thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Malat1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is among the most abundant lncRNAs whose expression is altered in numerous cancers. Here we report that genetic loss or systemic knockdown of Malat1 using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus)-PyMT mouse mammary carcinoma model results in slower tumor growth accompanied by significant differentiation into cystic tumors and a reduction in metastasis. Furthermore, Malat1 loss results in a reduction of branching morphogenesis in MMTV-PyMT- and Her2/neu-amplified tumor organoids, increased cell adhesion, and loss of migration. At the molecular level, Malat1 knockdown results in alterations in gene expression and changes in splicing patterns of genes involved in differentiation and protumorigenic signaling pathways. Together, these data demonstrate for the first time a functional role of Malat1 in regulating critical processes in mammary cancer pathogenesis. Thus, Malat1 represents an exciting therapeutic target, and Malat1 ASOs represent a potential therapy for inhibiting breast cancer progression.                 © 2016 Arun et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
30790075        	Pancreatic Cancer Organotypic Models.            	Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis for patients due to late diagnosis and ineffective treatment options. There is a desperate need for more accurate disease models to enable improved therapies and diagnostic tests to reach the clinic. Pancreatic tumours have a high content of desmoplastic stroma, which forms a stiff, hypoxic tumour mass and contributes significantly to tumour development and metastatic spread. Therefore, 2D cell culture is not sufficient for understanding the complex biology of this disease. 3D in vitro models offer a more representative method of culturing cells for research in the laboratory. There are many different 3D models that can be used in research, organoids formed from patient or murine tumours are grown embedded in collagen or matrigel matrices, giving the potential for screening treatment options and personalised therapy in the future. Also, organotypic models using pancreatic cancer cell lines and stromal cells can be easily manipulated to study different aspects of pancreatic cancer and new therapeutic options in the laboratory. There are new emerging pancreatic cancer 3D models being developed, including microchip technology or synthetic scaffolds instead collagen and matrigel. All of these 3D culturing methods give an advantage over traditional 2D cell culture and could lead to improved understanding of this disease, translating to a better prognosis for patients in the clinic.	
30469504        	2D- and 3D-Based Intestinal Stem Cell Cultures for Personalized Medicine.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers that have high occurrence and death in both males and females. As various factors have been found to contribute to CRC development, personalized therapies are critical for efficient treatment. To achieve this purpose, the establishment of patient-derived tumor models is critical for diagnosis and drug test. The establishment of three-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures and two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures of patient-derived epithelial tissues is a breakthrough for expanding living materials for later use. This review provides an overview of the different types of 2D- and 3D-based intestinal stem cell cultures, their potential benefits, and the drawbacks in personalized medicine in treatment of the intestinal disorders.	
31758842        	Decitabine limits escape from MEK inhibition in uveal melanoma.            	MEK inhibitors (MEKi) demonstrate anti-proliferative activity in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, but responses are short-lived. In the present study, we evaluated the MEKi trametinib alone and in combination with drugs targeting epigenetic regulators, including DOT1L, EZH2, LSD1, DNA methyltransferases, and histone acetyltransferases. The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) decitabine effectively enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of trametinib in cell viability, colony formation, and 3D organoid assays. RNA-Seq analysis showed the MEKi-DNMTi combination primarily affected the expression of genes involved in G1 and G2/2M checkpoints, cell survival, chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle. The DNMTi-MEKi combination did not appear to induce a DNA damage response (as measured by γH2AX foci) or senescence (as measured by β-galactosidase staining) compared to either MEKi or DNMTi alone. Instead, the combination increased expression of the CDK inhibitor p21 and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM. In vivo, the DNMTi-MEKi combination was more effective at suppressing growth of MP41 uveal melanoma xenografts than either drug alone. Our studies indicate that DNMTi may enhance the activity of MEKi in uveal melanoma.                © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	
30573781        	High cortactin expression in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with increased transendothelial migration and bone marrow relapse.            	Cancer is a major cause of death in children worldwide, with B-lineage cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) being the most frequent childhood malignancy. Relapse, treatment failure and organ infiltration worsen the prognosis, warranting a better understanding of the implicated mechanisms. Cortactin is an actin-binding protein involved in cell adhesion and migration that is overexpressed in many solid tumors and in adult B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we investigated cortactin expression and potential impact on infiltration and disease prognosis in childhood B-ALL. B-ALL cell lines and precursor cells from bone marrow (BM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of B-ALL patients indeed overexpressed cortactin. In CXCL12-induced transendothelial migration assays, transmigrated B-ALL cells had highest cortactin expression. In xenotransplantation models, only cortactinhigh-leukemic cells infiltrated lungs, brain, and testis; and they colonized more easily hypoxic BM organoids. Importantly, cortactin-depleted B-ALL cells were significantly less efficient in transendothelial migration, organ infiltration and BM colonization. Clinical data highlighted a significant correlation between high cortactin levels and BM relapse in drug-resistant high-risk B-ALL patients. Our results emphasize the importance of cortactin in B-ALL organ infiltration and BM relapse and its potential as diagnostic tool to identify high-risk patients and optimize their treatments.	
31235935        	R-spondin-3 induces secretory, antimicrobial Lgr5+ cells in the stomach.            	Wnt signalling stimulated by binding of R-spondin (Rspo) to Lgr-family members is crucial for gastrointestinal stem cell renewal. Infection of the stomach with Helicobacter pylori stimulates increased secretion of Rspo by myofibroblasts, leading to an increase in proliferation of Wnt-responsive Axin2+Lgr5- stem cells in the isthmus of the gastric gland and finally gastric gland hyperplasia. Basal Lgr5+ cells are also exposed to Rspo3, but their response remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that-in contrast to its known mitogenic activity-Rspo3 induces differentiation of basal Lgr5+ cells into secretory cells that express and secrete antimicrobial factors, such as intelectin-1, into the lumen. The depletion of Lgr5+ cells or the knockout of Rspo3 in myofibroblasts leads to hypercolonization of the gastric glands with H. pylori, including the stem cell compartment. By contrast, systemic administration or overexpression of Rspo3 in the stroma clears H. pylori from the gastric glands. Thus, the Rspo3-Lgr5 axis simultaneously regulates both antimicrobial defence and mucosal regeneration.	
30205170        	3D in vitro models of tumors expressing EGFR family receptors: a potent tool for studying receptor biology and targeted drug development.            	Carcinomas overexpressing EGFR family receptors are of high clinical importance, because the receptors have prognostic value and are used as molecular targets for anticancer therapy. Insufficient drug efficacy necessitates further in-depth research of the receptor biology and improvement in preclinical stages of drug evaluation. Here, we review the currently used advanced 3D in vitro models of tumors, including tumor spheroids, models in natural and synthetic matrices, tumor organoids and microfluidic-based models, as a potent tool for studying EGFR biology and targeted drug development. We are especially focused on factors that affect the biology of tumor cells, causing modification in the expression and basic phosphorylation of the receptors, crosstalk with other signaling pathways and switch between downstream cascades, resulting ultimately in the resistance to antitumor agents.

22914933        	Functional purification of human and mouse mammary stem cells.            	Normal and tumor stem cells are present in rare quantities in tissues and this has historically represented a major hurdle to in-depth investigations of their biology. In the case of the mammary gland, the relative promiscuity of the immunophenotypical markers described in several studies for the isolation of human and mouse mammary stem cells limits their usefulness, in particular when highly purified mammary stem cell fractions are required for an in-depth molecular and functional characterization (Stingl et al. Nature 439:993-997, 2006; Shackleton et al. Nature 439:84-88, 2006; Liao et al. Cancer Res 67:8131-8138, 2007; Eirew et al. Nat Med 14:1384-1389, 2008; Raouf et al. Cell Stem Cell 3:109-118, 2008; Lim et al. Nat Med 15:907-913, 2009). In fact, most so-called stem cell markers are not selectively expressed by mammary stem cells, but are instead also expressed by terminally differentiated luminal and/or myoepithelial cells or by bipotent progenitors within the mammary gland (Stingl et al. Nature 439:993-997, 2006; Eirew et al. Nat Med 14:1384-1389, 2008; Raouf et al. Cell Stem Cell 3:109-118, 2008; Stingl et al. Differentiation 63:201-213, 1998; Jones et al. Cancer Res 64:3037-3045, 2004). Here, we describe a new methodology that does not require the use of immunophenotypical markers to obtain highly pure populations of mammary stem cells. This approach exploits two functional properties of mammary stem cells: (1) their quiescent or slowly proliferative phenotype, as compared to their progeny; and (2) their ability to survive and proliferate in anchorage-independent conditions, giving rise to clonal spheroids, commonly known as "mammospheres" (Dontu et al. Genes Dev 17:1253-1270, 2003; Pece et al. Cell 140:62-73, 2010; Cicalese et al. Cell 138:1083-1095, 2009). In the context of mammospheres, stem cells, which perform one or two rounds of division and then reenter quiescence, are identified based on their ability to retain a lipophilic fluorescent dye, PKH26, that is by contrast progressively lost by dilution in the actively proliferating progeny of precursors (Pece et al. Cell 140:62-73, 2010; Cicalese et al. Cell 138:1083-1095, 2009). Following mammosphere dissociation, the differential degree of PKH26 epifluorescence displayed by stem cells compared to precursor cells is exploited for their purification by FACS sorting. As a result, the scarcely represented PKH26-labeled mammary stem cells are purified to near homogeneity and can be used for further molecular and biological studies.	
26271103        	Notch signaling regulates gastric antral LGR5 stem cell function.            	The major signaling pathways regulating gastric stem cells are unknown. Here we report that Notch signaling is essential for homeostasis of LGR5(+) antral stem cells. Pathway inhibition reduced proliferation of gastric stem and progenitor cells, while activation increased proliferation. Notch dysregulation also altered differentiation, with inhibition inducing mucous and endocrine cell differentiation while activation reduced differentiation. Analysis of gastric organoids demonstrated that Notch signaling was intrinsic to the epithelium and regulated growth. Furthermore, in vivo Notch manipulation affected the efficiency of organoid initiation from glands and single Lgr5-GFP stem cells, suggesting regulation of stem cell function. Strikingly, constitutive Notch activation in LGR5(+) stem cells induced tissue expansion via antral gland fission. Lineage tracing using a multi-colored reporter demonstrated that Notch-activated stem cells rapidly generate monoclonal glands, suggesting a competitive advantage over unmanipulated stem cells. Notch activation was associated with increased mTOR signaling, and mTORC1 inhibition normalized NICD-induced increases in proliferation and gland fission. Chronic Notch activation induced undifferentiated, hyper-proliferative polyps, suggesting that aberrant activation of Notch in gastric stem cells may contribute to gastric tumorigenesis.                © 2015 The Authors.	
32483423        	Small-molecule activating SIRT6 elicits therapeutic effects and synergistically promotes anti-tumor activity of vitamin D3 in colorectal cancer.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer death; however, targets with broad anti-CRC effects are limited. Sirtuin6 (SIRT6) is a conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase that is widely pathologically downregulated in CRC, but its pharmacological effect in CRC remains undefined due to the lack of small-molecule SIRT6 activators. We searched for a compound activating SIRT6 and investigated its anti-CRC effect in various models. Methods: We identified an allosteric SIRT6 activator, MDL-811. Its ability to enhance SIRT6 deacetylation at protein and cellular levels was evaluated by Fluor de Lys (FDL) and western blots. We assessed the proliferation of 26 CRC cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) treated with MDL-811. In vivo efficacy of MDL-811 was evaluated in HCT116 cell line- and patient-derived xenografts as well as a spontaneous CRC model. RNA sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR assays were performed to analyze gene expression changes in MDL-811-treated HCT116 cells. Along with controls in SIRT6-overexpressing HCT116 cells, the SIRT6-mediated histone H3 deacetylation at the Cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1 (CYP24A1) gene locus was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in MDL-811-treated HCT116 cells. A combination therapy against CRC based on the downstream gene of SIRT6 activation was evaluated in cells and mouse models. Results: MDL-811 significantly activated SIRT6 histone H3 deacetylation (H3K9Ac, H3K18Ac, and H3K56Ac) in vitro and had broad antiproliferative effects on diverse CRC cell lines and PDOs. More importantly, the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of MDL-811 was demonstrated across cell line- and patient-derived xenografts and in the APCmin/+ spontaneous CRC model. Mechanically, we identified a new downstream target gene of SIRT6 in CRC, CYP24A1. Based on these findings, a combination drug strategy with MDL-811 to synergistically enhance the anti-CRC effect of vitamin D3 was validated in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Our data provide proof of concept that targeting SIRT6 using a small-molecule activator is an attractive therapeutic strategy for CRC and that MDL-811 could be a promising lead compound for further preclinical and clinical studies of treatments for CRC.                © The author(s).	
33565332        	Stem cells as therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer.            	Colorectal cancer continues to represent a significant burden on public health as the second highest cause of cancer mortality, when men and women are combined, in the US. About 50% of patients either present with late-stage metastatic disease, or develop metastatic recurrences, and ultimately die. In turn, this mortality largely reflects cancer stem cells, tumor-initiating cells that are responsible for cancer progression, drug resistance, recurrence and metastasis. This review summarizes the unique properties of colorectal cancer stem cells, and the emerging strategies by which they can be selectively targeted as a therapeutic approach to eradicating this disease.	
32284370        	Functional Properties of Helicobacter pylori VacA Toxin m1 and m2 Variants.            	Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa and secretes a pore-forming toxin (VacA). Two main types of VacA, m1 and m2, can be distinguished by phylogenetic analysis. Type m1 forms of VacA have been extensively studied, but there has been relatively little study of m2 forms. In this study, we generated H. pylori strains producing chimeric proteins in which VacA m1 segments of a parental strain were replaced by corresponding m2 sequences. In comparison to the parental m1 VacA protein, a chimeric protein (designated m2/m1) containing m2 sequences in the N-terminal portion of the m region was less potent in causing vacuolation of HeLa cells, AGS gastric cells, and AZ-521 duodenal cells and had reduced capacity to cause membrane depolarization or death of AZ-521 cells. Consistent with the observed differences in activity, the chimeric m2/m1 VacA protein bound to cells at reduced levels compared to the binding levels of the parental m1 protein. The presence of two strain-specific insertions or deletions within or adjacent to the m region did not influence toxin activity. Experiments with human gastric organoids grown as monolayers indicated that m1 and m2/m1 forms of VacA had similar cell-vacuolating activities. Interestingly, both forms of VacA bound preferentially to the basolateral surface of organoid monolayers and caused increased cell vacuolation when interacting with the basolateral surface compared to the apical surface. These data provide insights into functional correlates of sequence variation in the VacA midregion (m region).                Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.	
22344263        	Mammary collective cell migration involves transient loss of epithelial features and individual cell migration within the epithelium.            	Normal mammary morphogenesis involves transitions between simple and multilayered epithelial organizations. We used electron microscopy and molecular markers to determine whether intercellular junctions and apico-basal polarity were maintained in the multilayered epithelium. We found that multilayered elongating ducts had polarized apical and basal tissue surfaces both in three-dimensional culture and in vivo. However, individual cells were only polarized on surfaces in contact with the lumen or extracellular matrix. The basolateral marker scribble and the apical marker atypical protein kinase C zeta localized to all interior cell membranes, whereas PAR3 displayed a cytoplasmic localization, suggesting that the apico-basal polarity was incomplete. Despite membrane localization of E-cadherin and β-catenin, we did not observe a defined zonula adherens connecting interior cells. Instead, interior cells were connected through desmosomes and exhibited complex interdigitating membrane protrusions. Single-cell labeling revealed that individual cells were both protrusive and migratory within the epithelial multilayer. Inhibition of Rho kinase (ROCK) further reduced intercellular adhesion on apical and lateral surfaces but did not disrupt basal tissue organization. Following morphogenesis, segregated membrane domains were re-established and junctional complexes re-formed. We observed similar epithelial organization during mammary morphogenesis in organotypic culture and in vivo. We conclude that mammary epithelial morphogenesis involves a reversible, spatially limited, reduction in polarity and intercellular junctions and active individualistic cell migration. Our data suggest that reductions in polarity and adhesion during breast cancer progression might reflect partial recapitulation of a normal developmental program.	
25242330        	Prox1 promotes expansion of the colorectal cancer stem cell population to fuel tumor growth and ischemia resistance.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation and growth is often attributed to stem cells, yet little is known about the regulation of these cells. We show here that a subpopulation of Prox1-transcription-factor-expressing cells have stem cell activity in intestinal adenomas, but not in the normal intestine. Using in vivo models and 3D ex vivo organoid cultures of mouse adenomas and human CRC, we found that Prox1 deletion reduced the number of stem cells and cell proliferation and decreased intestinal tumor growth via induction of annexin A1 and reduction of the actin-binding protein filamin A, which has been implicated as a prognostic marker in CRC. Loss of Prox1 also decreased autophagy and the survival of hypoxic tumor cells in tumor transplants. Thus, Prox1 is essential for the expansion of the stem cell pool in intestinal adenomas and CRC without being critical for the normal functions of the gut.

32143715        	Small molecule-induced simultaneous destabilization of β-catenin and RAS is an effective molecular strategy to suppress stemness of colorectal cancer cells.            	Cancer stem cells (CSCs), the major driver of tumorigenesis, is a sub-population of tumor cells responsible for poor clinical outcomes. However, molecular mechanism to identify targets for controlling CSCs is poorly understood.                Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of Wnt/β-catenin and RAS signaling pathways in stem-like subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were performed using two gene expression data set. The therapeutic effects of destabilization of β-catenin and RAS were tested by treatment of small molecule KYA1797K using CRC patient derived cells.                Treatment with KYA1797K, a small molecule that destabilizes both β-catenin and RAS via Axin binding, effectively suppresses the stemness of CSCs as shown in CRC spheroids and small intestinal tumors of ApcMin/+/K-RasG12DLA2 mice. Moreover, KYA1797K also suppresses the stemness of cells in CRC patient avatar model systems, such as patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX).                Our results suggest that destabilization of both β-catenin and RAS is a potential therapeutic strategy for controlling stemness of CRC cells. Video abstract.	
32009541        	Proscillaridin A slows the prostate cancer progression through triggering the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress.            	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second commonly diagnosed malignancy in men over the world. Although androgen deprivation therapy for advanced PCa patients has significantly improved their survival, the majority of these patients eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Proscillaridin A (Pro A), a cardiac glycoside that is clinically used to treat various heart failure diseases, has been reported to have anticancer activity in several cancers. However, whether Pro A exerts an inhibitory effect on PCa progression remains unknown. In this study, we determined possible antitumor effects of Pro A on PCa cells and demonstrated the following: firstly, Pro A selectively inhibited androgen-independent PCa (including PC3 and DU145) cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in vitro; secondly, Pro A significantly decreased cell motility and invasion of androgen-independent PCa cells; thirdly, Pro A enhanced the sensitivity of PCa cells to docetaxel; fourthly, Pro A significantly inhibited the growth of PCa xenografts in vivo and patient-derived organoids (PDO). In addition, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the antitumor effects of Pro A on androgen-independent PCa appeared to be achieved via driving the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress. The antitumor effects of Pro A could be ameliorated by reactive oxygen species scavenger and ER stress inhibitors. Therefore, these data suggest that Pro A may provide a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of PCa, particularly CRPC.	
32038993        	Upcoming Revolutionary Paths in Preclinical Modeling of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.            	To date, PDAC remains the cancer having the worst prognosis with mortality rates constantly on the rise. Efficient cures are still absent, despite all attempts to understand the aggressive physiopathology underlying this disease. A major stumbling block is the outdated preclinical modeling strategies applied in assessing effectiveness of novel anticancer therapeutics. Current in vitro preclinical models have a low fidelity to mimic the exact architectural and functional complexity of PDAC tumor found in human set, due to the lack of major components such as immune system and tumor microenvironment with its associated chemical and mechanical signals. The existing PDAC preclinical platforms are still far from being reliable and trustworthy to guarantee the success of a drug in clinical trials. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to innovate novel in vitro preclinical models that mirrors with precision tumor-microenvironment interface, pressure of immune system, and molecular and morphological aspects of the PDAC normally experienced within the living organ. This review outlines the traditional preclinical models of PDAC namely 2D cell lines, genetically engineered mice, and xenografts, and describing the present famous approach of 3D organoids. We offer a detailed narration of the pros and cons of each model system. Finally, we suggest the incorporation of two off-center newly born techniques named 3D bio-printing and organs-on-chip and discuss the potentials of swine models and in silico tools, as powerful new tools able to transform PDAC preclinical modeling to a whole new level and open new gates in personalized medicine.

33042263        	SYTL4 downregulates microtubule stability and confers paclitaxel resistance in triple-negative breast cancer.            	Background: Taxanes are frontline chemotherapeutic drugs for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, chemoresistance reduces their effectiveness. We hypothesized that the molecular profiling of tumor samples before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) would help identify genes associated with drug resistance. Methods: We sequenced 10 samples by RNA-seq from 8 NAC patients with TNBC: 3 patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) and the other 5 with non-pCR. Differentially expressed genes that predicted chemotherapy response were selected for in vitro functional screening via a small-scale siRNAs pool. The clinical and functional significance of the gene of interest in TNBC was further investigated in vitro and in vivo, and biochemical assays and imaging analysis were applied to study the mechanisms. Results: Synaptotagmin-like 4 (SYTL4), a Rab effector in vesicle transport, was identified as a leading functional candidate. High SYTL4 expression indicated a poor prognosis in multiple TNBC cohorts, specifically in taxane-treated TNBCs. SYTL4 was identified as a novel chemoresistant gene as validated in TNBC cells, a mouse model and patient-derived organoids. Mechanistically, downregulating SYTL4 stabilized the microtubule network and slowed down microtubule growth rate. Furthermore, SYTL4 colocalized with microtubules and interacted with microtubules through its middle region containing the linker and C2A domain. Finally, we found that SYTL4 was able to bind microtubules and inhibit the in vitro microtubule polymerization. Conclusion: SYTL4 is a novel chemoresistant gene in TNBC and its upregulation indicates poor prognosis in taxane-treated TNBC. Further, SYTL4 directly binds microtubules and decreases microtubule stability.                © The author(s).	
31913606        	Trehalose-Based Polyethers for Cryopreservation and Three-Dimensional Cell Scaffolds.            	The capability to slow ice growth and recrystallization is compulsory in the cryopreservation of cells and tissues to avoid injuries associated with the physical and chemical responses of freezing and thawing. Cryoprotective agents (CPAs) have been used to restrain cryoinjury and improve cell survival, but some of these compounds pose greater risks for the clinical application of cryopreserved cells due to their inherent toxicity. Trehalose is known for its unique physicochemical properties and its interaction with the phospholipids of the plasma membrane, which can reduce cell osmotic stress and stabilized the cryopreserved cells. Nonetheless, there has been a shortage of relevant studies on the synthesis of trehalose-based CPAs. We hereby report the synthesis and evaluation of a trehalose-based polymer and hydrogel and its use as a cryoprotectant and three-dimensional (3D) cell scaffold for cell encapsulation and organoid production. In vitro cytotoxicity studies with the trehalose-based polymers (poly(Tre-ECH)) demonstrated biocompatibility up to 100 mg/mL. High post-thaw cell membrane integrity and post-thaw cell plating efficiencies were achieved after 24 h of incubation with skin fibroblast, HeLa (cervical), and PC3 (prostate) cancer cell lines under both controlled-rate and ultrarapid freezing protocols. Differential scanning calorimetry and a splat cooling assay for the determination of ice recrystallization inhibition activity corroborated the unique properties of these trehalose-based polyethers as cryoprotectants. Furthermore, the ability to form hydrogels as 3D cell scaffolds encourages the use of these novel polymers in the development of cell organoids and cryopreservation platforms.	
32693086        	Mesenchymal Niche-Derived Neuregulin-1 Drives Intestinal Stem Cell Proliferation and Regeneration of Damaged Epithelium.            	Epidermal growth factor (EGF) maintains intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and is a key component of organoid growth media yet is dispensable for intestinal homeostasis, suggesting roles for multiple EGF family ligands in ISC function. Here, we identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1) as a key EGF family ligand that drives tissue repair following injury. NRG1, but not EGF, is upregulated upon damage and is expressed in mesenchymal stromal cells, macrophages, and Paneth cells. NRG1 deletion reduces proliferation in intestinal crypts and compromises regeneration capacity. NRG1 robustly stimulates proliferation in crypts and induces budding in organoids, in part through elevated and sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT. Consistently, NRG1 treatment induces a proliferative gene signature and promotes organoid formation from progenitor cells and enhances regeneration following injury. These data suggest mesenchymal-derived NRG1 is a potent mediator of tissue regeneration and may inform the development of therapies for enhancing intestinal repair after injury.

33056980        	Cellular senescence contributes to radiation-induced hyposalivation by affecting the stem/progenitor cell niche.            	Radiotherapy for head and neck cancer is associated with impairment of salivary gland function and consequent xerostomia, which has a devastating effect on the quality of life of the patients. The mechanism of radiation-induced salivary gland damage is not completely understood. Cellular senescence is a permanent state of cell cycle arrest accompanied by a secretory phenotype which contributes to inflammation and tissue deterioration. Genotoxic stresses, including radiation-induced DNA damage, are known to induce a senescence response. Here, we show that radiation induces cellular senescence preferentially in the salivary gland stem/progenitor cell niche of mouse models and patients. Similarly, salivary gland-derived organoids show increased expression of senescence markers and pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors after radiation exposure. Clearance of senescent cells by selective removal of p16Ink4a-positive cells by the drug ganciclovir or the senolytic drug ABT263 lead to increased stem cell self-renewal capacity as measured by organoid formation efficiency. Additionally, pharmacological treatment with ABT263 in mice irradiated to the salivary glands mitigates tissue degeneration, thus preserving salivation. Our data suggest that senescence in the salivary gland stem/progenitor cell niche contributes to radiation-induced hyposalivation. Pharmacological targeting of senescent cells may represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent radiotherapy-induced xerostomia.	
33515805        	Intraepithelial Lymphocytes Suppress Intestinal Tumor Growth by Cell-to-Cell Contact via CD103/E-Cadherin Signal.            	The reason why small intestinal cancer is rarer than colorectal cancer is not clear. We hypothesized that intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), which are enriched in the small intestine, are the closest immune cells to epithelial cells, exclude tumor cells via cell-to-cell contact.                We developed DPE-GFP × APCmin mice, which is a T-cell-reporter mouse with spontaneous intestinal tumors. We visualized the dynamics of IELs in the intestinal tumor microenvironment and the interaction between IELs and epithelial cells, and the roles of cell-to-cell contact in anti-intestinal tumor immunity using a novel in vivo live-imaging system and a novel in vitro co-culture system.                In the small intestinal tumor microenvironment, T-cell movement was restricted around blood vessels and the frequency of interaction between IELs and epithelial cells was reduced. Genetic deletion of CD103 decreased the frequency of interaction between IELs and epithelial cells, and increased the number of small intestinal tumors. In the co-culture system, wild-type IELs expanded and infiltrated to intestinal tumor organoids from APCmin mice and reduced the viability of them, which was cell-to-cell contact and the expression of CD103 on IELs dependent.                The abundance of IELs in the small intestine may contribute to a low number of tumors, although this system may not work in the colon because of the sparseness of IELs. Strategies to increase the number of IELs in the colon or enhance cell-to-cell contact between IELs and epithelial cells may be effective for the prevention of intestinal tumors in patients with a high cancer risk.

30787442        	The centrosome protein AKNA regulates neurogenesis via microtubule organization.            	The expansion of brain size is accompanied by a relative enlargement of the subventricular zone during development. Epithelial-like neural stem cells divide in the ventricular zone at the ventricles of the embryonic brain, self-renew and generate basal progenitors1 that delaminate and settle in the subventricular zone in enlarged brain regions2. The length of time that cells stay in the subventricular zone is essential for controlling further amplification and fate determination. Here we show that the interphase centrosome protein AKNA has a key role in this process. AKNA localizes at the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole in specific subtypes of neural stem cells, and in almost all basal progenitors. This protein is necessary and sufficient to organize centrosomal microtubules, and promote their nucleation and growth. These features of AKNA are important for mediating the delamination process in the formation of the subventricular zone. Moreover, AKNA regulates the exit from the subventricular zone, which reveals the pivotal role of centrosomal microtubule organization in enabling cells to both enter and remain in the subventricular zone. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is also regulated by AKNA in other epithelial cells, demonstrating its general importance for the control of cell delamination.	
33667368        	An expanded universe of cancer targets.            	The characterization of cancer genomes has provided insight into somatically altered genes across tumors, transformed our understanding of cancer biology, and enabled tailoring of therapeutic strategies. However, the function of most cancer alleles remains mysterious, and many cancer features transcend their genomes. Consequently, tumor genomic characterization does not influence therapy for most patients. Approaches to understand the function and circuitry of cancer genes provide complementary approaches to elucidate both oncogene and non-oncogene dependencies. Emerging work indicates that the diversity of therapeutic targets engendered by non-oncogene dependencies is much larger than the list of recurrently mutated genes. Here we describe a framework for this expanded list of cancer targets, providing novel opportunities for clinical translation.                Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
29720906        	Development of Preclinical Models to Understand and Treat Colorectal Cancer.            	The establishment and validation of preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate the pathogenesis and treatment response of human colorectal cancer (CRC) is critical to expedient therapeutic advances in the clinical management of this disease. Integral to the application of precision medicine for patients diagnosed with metastatic CRC is the need to understand the molecular determinants of response for a given therapy. Preclinical models of CRC have proven invaluable in answering many of our basic questions relating to the molecular aberrations that drive colorectal tumor progression. This review will address the comparative merits and limitations of the broad spectrum of in vitro and in vivo models available for study of colorectal tumors and their response to experimental therapies.	
25965345        	Optimization of Invasion-Specific Effects of Betulin Derivatives on Prostate Cancer Cells through Lead Development.            	The anti-invasive and anti-proliferative effects of betulins and abietane derivatives was systematically tested using an organotypic model system of advanced, castration-resistant prostate cancers. A preliminary screen of the initial set of 93 compounds was performed in two-dimensional (2D) growth conditions using non-transformed prostate epithelial cells (EP156T), an androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP), and the castration-resistant, highly invasive cell line PC-3. The 25 most promising compounds were all betulin derivatives. These were selected for a focused secondary screen in three-dimensional (3D) growth conditions, with the goal to identify the most effective and specific anti-invasive compounds. Additional sensitivity and cytotoxicity tests were then performed using an extended cell line panel. The effects of these compounds on cell cycle progression, mitosis, proliferation and unspecific cytotoxicity, versus their ability to specifically interfere with cell motility and tumor cell invasion was addressed. To identify potential mechanisms of action and likely compound targets, multiplex profiling of compound effects on a panel of 43 human protein kinases was performed. These target de-convolution studies, combined with the phenotypic analyses of multicellular organoids in 3D models, revealed specific inhibition of AKT signaling linked to effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton as the most likely driver of altered cell morphology and motility.	
32227170        	Gut Microbiota-Derived Propionate Regulates the Expression of Reg3 Mucosal Lectins and Ameliorates Experimental Colitis in Mice.            	Regenerating islet-derived protein type 3 [Reg3] lectins are antimicrobial peptides at mucosal surfaces of the gut, whose expression is regulated by pathogenic gut microbes via interleukin-22- or Toll-like receptor signalling. In addition to antimicrobial effects, tissue protection is hypothesized, but has been poorly investigated in the gut.                We applied antibiotic-induced microbiota perturbations, gnotobiotic approaches and a dextran-sodium sulfate [DSS] colitis model to assess microbial Reg3 regulation in the intestines and its role in colitis. We also used an intestinal organoid model to investigate this axis in vitro.                First, we studied whether gut commensals are involved in Reg3 expression in mice, and found that antibiotic-mediated reduction of Clostridia downregulated intestinal Reg3B. A loss in Clostridia was accompanied by a significant reduction of short-chain fatty acids [SCFAs], and knock-out [KO] mice for SCFA receptors GPR43 and GPR109 expressed less intestinal Reg3B/-G. Propionate was found to induce Reg3 in intestinal organoids and in gnotobiotic mice colonized with a defined, SCFA-producing microbiota. Investigating the role of Reg3B as a protective factor in colitis, we found that Reg3B-KO mice display increased inflammation and less crypt proliferation in the DSS colitis model. Propionate decreased colitis and increased proliferation. Treatment of organoids exposed to DSS with Reg3B or propionate reversed the chemical injury with a loss of expression of the stem-cell marker Lgr5 and Olfm4.                Our results suggest that Clostridia can regulate Reg3-associated epithelial homeostasis through propionate signalling. We also provide evidence that the Reg3-propionate axis may be an important mediator of gut epithelial regeneration in colitis.                © The Author(s) 2020.

32555344        	WNT and inflammatory signaling distinguish human Fallopian tube epithelial cell populations.            	Many high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs) likely originate in the distal region of the Fallopian tube's epithelium (TE) before metastasizing to the ovary. Unfortunately, molecular mechanisms promoting malignancy in the distal TE are obfuscated, largely due to limited primary human TE gene expression data. Here we report an in depth bioinformatic characterization of 34 primary TE mRNA-seq samples. These samples were prepared from proximal and distal TE regions of 12 normal Fallopian tubes. Samples were segregated based on their aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. Distal cells form organoids with higher frequency and larger size during serial organoid formation assays when compared to proximal cells. Consistent with enrichment for stem/progenitor cells, ALDH+ cells have greater WNT signaling. Comparative evaluation of proximal and distal TE cell population's shows heightened inflammatory signaling in distal differentiated (ALDH-) TE. Furthermore, comparisons of proximal and distal TE cell populations finds that the distal ALDH+ TE cells exhibit pronounced expression of gene sets characteristic of HGSC sub-types. Overall, our study indicates increased organoid forming capacity, WNT/inflammatory signaling, and HGSC signatures underlie differences between distal and proximal regions of the human TE. These findings provide the basis for further mechanistic studies of distal TE susceptibility to the malignant transformation.	
32684087        	Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis induces the stemness in colorectal cancer via upregulating histone demethylase JMJD2B.            	The enrichment of Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) has been identified in CRC patients and associated with worse prognosis. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play essential roles in CRC development. However, whether ETBF is involved in CSCs regulation is unknown. To clarify the role of ETBF in CSCs properties, we performed extreme limited dilution assays (ELDA) in nude mice injected with ETBF-treated or untreated CRC cells subcutaneously, tumor organoids culture in azoxymethane (AOM) mouse model after gavaging with or without ETBF, and cell sphere formation assay after incubating CRC cell lines with or without ETBF. The results indicated that ETBF increased the stemness of CRC cells in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, ETBF enhanced the expression of core stemness transcription factors Nanog homeobox (NANOG) and sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2). Histone H3 Lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) is critical in regulating CSCs properties. As an epigenetic and transcriptional regulator, JmjC-domain containing histone demethylase 2B (JMJD2B) is essential for embryonic stem cell (ESC) transformation and H3K9me3 demethylation. Mechanistically, ETBF infection significantly upregulated JMJD2B levels in CRC cell lines and nude mice xenograft model. JMJD2B epigenetically upregulated NANOG expression via demethylating its promoter H3K9me3, to mediate ETBF-induced stemness of CRC cells. Subsequently, we found that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway, activated by ETBF, contributed to the enhanced expression of JMJD2B via nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5). Finally, in human CRC samples, the amount of ETBF positively correlated with nuclear NFAT5, JMJD2B, and NANOG expression levels. In summary, ETBF upregulated JMJD2B levels in a TLR4-NFAT5-dependent pathway, and played an important role in stemness regulation, which promoted colorectal carcinogenesis.	
31853059        	Somatic inflammatory gene mutations in human ulcerative colitis epithelium.            	With ageing, normal human tissues experience an expansion of somatic clones that carry cancer mutations1-7. However, whether such clonal expansion exists in the non-neoplastic intestine remains unknown. Here, using whole-exome sequencing data from 76 clonal human colon organoids, we identify a unique pattern of somatic mutagenesis in the inflamed epithelium of patients with ulcerative colitis. The affected epithelium accumulates somatic mutations in multiple genes that are related to IL-17 signalling-including NFKBIZ, ZC3H12A and PIGR, which are genes that are rarely affected in colon cancer. Targeted sequencing validates the pervasive spread of mutations that are related to IL-17 signalling. Unbiased CRISPR-based knockout screening in colon organoids reveals that the mutations confer resistance to the pro-apoptotic response that is induced by IL-17A. Some of these genetic mutations are known to exacerbate experimental colitis in mice8-11, and somatic mutagenesis in human colon epithelium may be causally linked to the inflammatory process. Our findings highlight a genetic landscape that adapts to a hostile microenvironment, and demonstrate its potential contribution to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.	
31174415        	Nerve Growth Factor Induces Proliferation and Aggressiveness In Prostate Cancer Cells.            	Resistance to hormone therapy and disease progression is the major challenge in clinical management of prostate cancer (PC). Drugs currently used in PC therapy initially show a potent antitumor effects, but PC gradually develops resistance, relapses and spreads. Most patients who fail primary therapy and have recurrences eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is almost incurable. The nerve growth factor (NGF) acts on a variety of non-neuronal cells by activating the NGF tyrosine-kinase receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). NGF signaling is deregulated in PC. In androgen-dependent PC cells, TrkA mediates the proliferative action of NGF through its crosstalk with the androgen receptor (AR). Epithelial PC cells, however, acquire the ability to express NGF and TrkA, as the disease progresses, indicating a role for NGF/TrkA axis in PC progression and androgen-resistance. We here report that once activated by NGF, TrkA mediates proliferation, invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in various CRPC cells. NGF promotes organoid growth in 3D models of CRPC cells, and specific inhibition of TrkA impairs all these responses. Thus TrkA represents a new biomarker to target in CRPC.	
31494779        	The Eleventh ENBDC Workshop: Advances in Technology Help to Unveil Mechanisms of Mammary Gland Development and Cancerogenesis.            	The eleventh annual workshop of the European Network for Breast Development and Cancer, Methods in mammary gland biology and breast cancer, took place on the 16th to 18th of May 2019 in Weggis, Switzerland. The main topics of the meeting were high resolution genomics and proteomics for the study of mammary gland development and cancer, breast cancer signaling, tumor microenvironment, preclinical models of breast cancer, and tissue morphogenesis. Exciting novel findings in, or highly relevant to, mammary gland biology and breast cancer field were presented, with insights into the methods used to obtain them. Among others, the discussed methods included single-cell RNA sequencing, genetic barcoding, lineage tracing, spatial transcriptomics, optogenetics, genetic mouse models and organoids.	
32601394        	Three-dimensional single-cell imaging for the analysis of RNA and protein expression in intact tumour biopsies.            	Microscopy analysis of tumour samples is commonly performed on fixed, thinly sectioned and protein-labelled tissues. However, these examinations do not reveal the intricate three-dimensional structures of tumours, nor enable the detection of aberrant transcripts. Here, we report a method, which we name DIIFCO (for diagnosing in situ immunofluorescence-labelled cleared oncosamples), for the multimodal volumetric imaging of RNAs and proteins in intact tumour volumes and organoids. We used DIIFCO to spatially profile the expression of diverse coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs at the single-cell resolution in a variety of cancer tissues. Quantitative single-cell analysis revealed spatial niches of cancer stem-like cells, and showed that the niches were present at a higher density in triple-negative breast cancer tissue. The improved molecular phenotyping and histopathological diagnosis of cancers may lead to new insights into the biology of tumours of patients.	
31175877        	IL-13-induced intestinal secretory epithelial cell antigen passages are required for IgE-mediated food-induced anaphylaxis.            	Food-induced anaphylaxis (FIA) is an IgE-dependent immune response that can affect multiple organs and lead to life-threatening complications. The processes by which food allergens cross the mucosal surface and are delivered to the subepithelial immune compartment to promote the clinical manifestations associated with food-triggered anaphylaxis are largely unexplored.                We sought to define the processes involved in the translocation of food allergens across the mucosal epithelial surface to the subepithelial immune compartment in FIA.                Two-photon confocal and immunofluorescence microscopy was used to visualize and trace food allergen passage in a murine model of FIA. A human colon cancer cell line, RNA silencing, and pharmacologic approaches were used to identify the molecular regulation of intestinal epithelial allergen uptake and translocation. Human intestinal organoid transplants were used to demonstrate the conservation of these molecular processes in human tissues.                Food allergens are sampled by using small intestine (SI) epithelial secretory cells (termed secretory antigen passages [SAPs]) that are localized to the SI villous and crypt region. SAPs channel food allergens to lamina propria mucosal mast cells through an IL-13-CD38-cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR)-dependent process. Blockade of IL-13-induced CD38/cADPR-dependent SAP antigen passaging in mice inhibited induction of clinical manifestations of FIA. IL-13-CD38-cADPR-dependent SAP sampling of food allergens was conserved in human intestinal organoids.                We identify that SAPs are a mechanism by which food allergens are channeled across the SI epithelium mediated by the IL-13/CD38/cADPR pathway, regulate the onset of FIA reactions, and are conserved in human intestine.

33039466        	Targeting DNA Damage Response and Replication Stress in Pancreatic Cancer.            	Continuing recalcitrance to therapy cements pancreatic cancer (PC) as the most lethal malignancy, which is set to become the second leading cause of cancer death in our society. The study aim was to investigate the association between DNA damage response (DDR), replication stress, and novel therapeutic response in PC to develop a biomarker-driven therapeutic strategy targeting DDR and replication stress in PC.                We interrogated the transcriptome, genome, proteome, and functional characteristics of 61 novel PC patient-derived cell lines to define novel therapeutic strategies targeting DDR and replication stress. Validation was done in patient-derived xenografts and human PC organoids.                Patient-derived cell lines faithfully recapitulate the epithelial component of pancreatic tumors, including previously described molecular subtypes. Biomarkers of DDR deficiency, including a novel signature of homologous recombination deficiency, cosegregates with response to platinum (P < .001) and PARP inhibitor therapy (P < .001) in vitro and in vivo. We generated a novel signature of replication stress that predicts response to ATR (P < .018) and WEE1 inhibitor (P < .029) treatment in both cell lines and human PC organoids. Replication stress was enriched in the squamous subtype of PC (P < .001) but was not associated with DDR deficiency.                Replication stress and DDR deficiency are independent of each other, creating opportunities for therapy in DDR-proficient PC and after platinum therapy.                Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

25406584        	Non-enzymatic, serum-free tissue culture of pre-invasive breast lesions for spontaneous generation of mammospheres.            	Breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), by definition, is proliferation of neoplastic epithelial cells within the confines of the breast duct, without breaching the collagenous basement membrane. While DCIS is a non-obligate precursor to invasive breast cancers, the molecular mechanisms and cell populations that permit progression to invasive cancer are not fully known. To determine if progenitor cells capable of invasion existed within the DCIS cell population, we developed a methodology for collecting and culturing sterile human breast tissue at the time of surgery, without enzymatic disruption of tissue. Sterile breast tissue containing ductal segments is harvested from surgically excised breast tissue following routine pathological examination. Tissue containing DCIS is placed in nutrient rich, antibiotic-containing, serum free medium, and transported to the tissue culture laboratory. The breast tissue is further dissected to isolate the calcified areas. Multiple breast tissue pieces (organoids) are placed in a minimal volume of serum free medium in a flask with a removable lid and cultured in a humidified CO₂ incubator. Epithelial and fibroblast cell populations emerge from the organoid after 10 - 14 days. Mammospheres spontaneously form on and around the epithelial cell monolayer. Specific cell populations can be harvested directly from the flask without disrupting neighboring cells. Our non-enzymatic tissue culture system reliably reveals cytogenetically abnormal, invasive progenitor cells from fresh human DCIS lesions.	
33189893        	A Novel PAK1-Notch1 Axis Regulates Crypt Homeostasis in Intestinal Inflammation.            	p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1) belongs to a family of serine-threonine kinases and contributes to cellular pathways such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), and Wingless-related integration site(Wnt)/β-catenin, all of which are involved in intestinal homeostasis. Overexpression of PAK1 is linked to inflammatory bowel disease as well as colitis-associated cancer (CAC), and similarly was observed in interleukin (IL)10 knockout (KO) mice, a model of colitis and CAC. Here, we tested the effects of PAK1 deletion on intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis in IL10 KO mice.                IL10/PAK1 double-knockout (DKO) mice were generated and development of colitis and CAC was analyzed. Large intestines were measured and prepared for histology or RNA isolation. Swiss rolls were stained with H&E and periodic acid-Schiff. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were performed using intestinal organoids, SW480, and normal human colon epithelial cells 1CT.                When compared with IL10 KO mice, DKOs showed longer colons and prolonged crypts, despite having higher inflammation and numbers of dysplasia. Crypt hyperproliferation was associated with Notch1 activation and diminished crypt differentiation, indicated by a reduction of goblet cells. Gene expression analysis indicated up-regulation of the Notch1 target hairy and enhancer of split-1 and the stem cell receptor leucin-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 in DKO mice. Interestingly, the stem cell marker olfactomedin-4 was present in colonic tissue. Increased β-catenin messenger RNA and cytoplasmic accumulation indicated aberrant Wnt signaling. Co-localization and direct interaction of Notch1 and PAK1 was found in colon epithelial cells. Notch1 activation abrogated this effect whereas silencing of PAK1 led to Notch1 activation.                PAK1 contributes to the regulation of crypt homeostasis under inflammatory conditions by controlling Notch1. This identifies a novel PAK1-Notch1 axis in intestinal pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease and CAC.                Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

33199632        	Unbiased in vivo preclinical evaluation of anticancer drugs identifies effective therapy for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, which limits surgical options and portends a dismal prognosis. Current oncologic PDAC therapies confer marginal benefit and, thus, a significant unmet clinical need exists for new therapeutic strategies. To identify effective PDAC therapies, we leveraged a syngeneic orthotopic PDAC transplant mouse model to perform a large-scale, in vivo screen of 16 single-agent and 41 two-drug targeted therapy combinations in mice. Among 57 drug conditions screened, combined inhibition of heat shock protein (Hsp)-90 and MEK was found to produce robust suppression of tumor growth, leading to an 80% increase in the survival of PDAC-bearing mice with no significant toxicity. Mechanistically, we observed that single-agent MEK inhibition led to compensatory activation of resistance pathways, including components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis, which was overcome with the addition of HSP90 inhibition. The combination of HSP90(i) + MEK(i) was also active in vitro in established human PDAC cell lines and in vivo in patient-derived organoid PDAC transplant models. These findings encourage the clinical development of HSP90(i) + MEK(i) combination therapy and highlight the power of clinically relevant in vivo model systems for identifying cancer therapies.

33652749        	Short-Form Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (sfTSLP) Is the Predominant Isoform Expressed by Gynaecologic Cancers and Promotes Tumour Growth.            	Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial cell derived cytokine belonging to the IL-7 family and a key initiator of allergic inflammation. Two main isoforms of TSLP, classified as long- (lfTSLP) and short-form (sfTSLP), have been reported in human, but their expression patterns and role(s) in cancers are not yet clear. mRNA expression was examined by isoform-specific RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridisation. Epigenetic regulation was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Tumour progression was investigated by gene overexpression, cell viability assay, cancer organoid culture and transwell invasion. Signals were investigated by proteome profiler protein array and RNA-sequencing. With the use of isoform-specific primers and probes, we uncovered that only sfTSLP was expressed in the cell lines and tumour tissues of human ovarian and endometrial cancers. We also showed the epigenetic regulation of sfTSLP: sfTSLP transcription was regulated by histone acetylation at promoters in ovarian cancer cells, whereas silencing of the sfTSLP transcripts was regulated by promoter DNA methylation in endometrial cancer cells. In vitro study showed that ectopically overexpressing sfTSLP promoted tumour growth but not invasion. Human phosphokinase array application demonstrated that the sfTSLP overexpression activated phosphorylation of multiple intracellular kinases (including GSK3α/β, AMPKα1, p53, AKT1/2, ERK1/2 and Src) in ovarian cancer cells in a context-dependent manner. We further investigated the impact of sfTSLP overexpression on transcriptome by RNA-sequencing and found that EFNB2 and PBX1 were downregulated in ovarian and endometrial cancer cells, suggesting their role in sfTSLP-mediated tumour growth. In conclusion, sfTSLP is predominantly expressed in ovarian and endometrial cancers and promotes tumour growth.	
32714605        	Preclinical models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma for a basic understanding of cancer biology and its translation into efficient therapies.            	Comprehensive molecular characterization of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has led to the identification of distinct molecular subgroups with fundamental differences in biological properties and clinical behavior. Despite improvements in tumor classification and increased understanding about the signaling pathways involved in neoplastic transformation and disease progression, current standard-of-care treatment for HNSCC mostly remains to be based on a stage-dependent strategy whereby all patients at the same stage receive the same treatment. Preclinical models that closely resemble molecular HNSCC subgroups that can be exploited for dissecting the biological function of genetic variants and/or altered gene expression will be highly valuable for translating molecular findings into improved clinical care. In the present review, we merge and discuss existing and new information on established cell lines, primary two- and three-dimensional ex vivo tumor cultures from HNSCC patients, and animal models. We review their value in elucidating the basic biology of HNSCC, molecular mechanisms of treatment resistance and their potential for the development of novel molecularly stratified treatment.                © The Author(s) 2020.	
33299656        	NK cells in pancreatic cancer demonstrate impaired cytotoxicity and a regulatory IL-10 phenotype.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most common tumor subtypes and remains associated with very poor survival. T cell infiltration into tumor tissue is associated with improved clinical outcome but little is known regarding the potential role of NK cells in disease control. Here we analyze the phenotype and function of NK cells in the blood and tumor tissue from patients with PDAC. Peripheral NK cells are present in normal numbers but display a CD16hiCD57hi phenotype with marked downregulation of NKG2D. Importantly, these cells demonstrate reduced cytotoxic activity and low levels of IFN-γ expression but instead produce high levels of intracellular IL-10, an immunoregulatory cytokine found at increased levels in the blood of PDAC patients. In contrast, NK cells are largely excluded from tumor tissue where they display strong downregulation of both CD16 and CD57, a phenotype that was recapitulated in primary NK cells following co-culture with PDAC organoids. Moreover, expression of activatory proteins, including DNAM-1 and NKP30, was markedly suppressed and the DNAM-1 ligand PVR was strongly expressed on tumor cells. As such, in situ and peripheral NK cells display differential features in patients with PDAC and indicate local and systemic mechanisms by which the tumor can evade immune control. These findings offer a number of potential options for NK-based immunotherapy in the management of patients with PDAC.                © 2020 The Author(s).

32912900        	SMARCB1 loss interacts with neuronal differentiation state to block maturation and impact cell stability.            	Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) are challenging pediatric brain cancers that are predominantly associated with inactivation of the gene SMARCB1, a conserved subunit of the chromatin remodeling BAF complex, which has known contributions to developmental processes. To identify potential interactions between SMARCB1 loss and the process of neural development, we introduced an inducible SMARCB1 loss-of-function system into human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that were subjected to either directed neuronal differentiation or differentiation into cerebral organoids. Using this system, we identified substantial differences in the downstream effects of SMARCB1 loss depending on differentiation state and identified an interaction between SMARCB1 loss and neural differentiation pressure that causes a resistance to terminal differentiation and a defect in maintenance of a normal cell state. Our results provide insight into how SMARCB1 loss might interact with neural development in the process of ATRT tumorigenesis.                © 2020 Parisian et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
29599208        	Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells reside in an unlicensed G1 phase.            	During late mitosis and the early G1 phase, the origins of replication are licensed by binding to double hexamers of MCM2-7. In this study, we investigated how licensing and proliferative commitment are coupled in the epithelium of the small intestine. We developed a method for identifying cells in intact tissue containing DNA-bound MCM2-7. Interphase cells above the transit-amplifying compartment had no DNA-bound MCM2-7, but still expressed the MCM2-7 protein, suggesting that licensing is inhibited immediately upon differentiation. Strikingly, we found most proliferative Lgr5+ stem cells are in an unlicensed state. This suggests that the elongated cell-cycle of intestinal stem cells is caused by an increased G1 length, characterized by dormant periods with unlicensed origins. Significantly, the unlicensed state is lost in Apc-mutant epithelium, which lacks a functional restriction point, causing licensing immediately upon G1 entry. We propose that the unlicensed G1 phase of intestinal stem cells creates a temporal window when proliferative fate decisions can be made.                © 2018 Carroll et al.	
26748848        	A Designed Inhibitor of p53 Aggregation Rescues p53 Tumor Suppression in Ovarian Carcinomas.            	Half of all human cancers lose p53 function by missense mutations, with an unknown fraction of these containing p53 in a self-aggregated amyloid-like state. Here we show that a cell-penetrating peptide, ReACp53, designed to inhibit p53 amyloid formation, rescues p53 function in cancer cell lines and in organoids derived from high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC), an aggressive cancer characterized by ubiquitous p53 mutations. Rescued p53 behaves similarly to its wild-type counterpart in regulating target genes, reducing cell proliferation and increasing cell death. Intraperitoneal administration decreases tumor proliferation and shrinks xenografts in vivo. Our data show the effectiveness of targeting a specific aggregation defect of p53 and its potential applicability to HGSOCs.                 Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
25705626        	Intestinal tumor in a dish.            	Predicting the response of colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors to novel chemotherapeutic agents is significantly complicated by their underlying genetic and epigenetic diversity. Large-scale clinical trials involving thousands of patients are often necessary in order to accurately determine efficacy during drug development. Recent advances in genetic sequencing has allowed us to improve the prediction of drug response through genetic stratification of patients into smaller populations, yet the complexity of the cancer genome still often confounds accuracy of drug response prediction. Ultimately, we may need to replicate patient's own tumor in a dish in order to test drug responses so that the optimal treatment can be identified. We recently developed highly efficient and tractable organoid culture system for intestinal stem cells, in which single stem cells form 3D structures recapitulating original tissue architecture. This technology has also been applied to colorectal tumors and enables us to monitor the growth and response of the patient's own tumors. In this review, we provide an overview focusing on CRC organoid culture and its perspective for clinical applications.	
28754000        	The Role of Tumor Microenvironment in Chemoresistance: To Survive, Keep Your Enemies Closer.            	Chemoresistance is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer and it continues to be a challenge in cancer treatment. Chemoresistance is influenced by genetic and epigenetic alterations which affect drug uptake, metabolism and export of drugs at the cellular levels. While most research has focused on tumor cell autonomous mechanisms of chemoresistance, the tumor microenvironment has emerged as a key player in the development of chemoresistance and in malignant progression, thereby influencing the development of novel therapies in clinical oncology. It is not surprising that the study of the tumor microenvironment is now considered to be as important as the study of tumor cells. Recent advances in technological and analytical methods, especially 'omics' technologies, has made it possible to identify specific targets in tumor cells and within the tumor microenvironment to eradicate cancer. Tumors need constant support from previously 'unsupportive' microenvironments. Novel therapeutic strategies that inhibit such microenvironmental support to tumor cells would reduce chemoresistance and tumor relapse. Such strategies can target stromal cells, proteins released by stromal cells and non-cellular components such as the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the tumor microenvironment. Novel in vitro tumor biology models that recapitulate the in vivo tumor microenvironment such as multicellular tumor spheroids, biomimetic scaffolds and tumor organoids are being developed and are increasing our understanding of cancer cell-microenvironment interactions. This review offers an analysis of recent developments on the role of the tumor microenvironment in the development of chemoresistance and the strategies to overcome microenvironment-mediated chemoresistance. We propose a systematic analysis of the relationship between tumor cells and their respective tumor microenvironments and our data show that, to survive, cancer cells interact closely with tumor microenvironment components such as mesenchymal stem cells and the extracellular matrix.	
32917713        	LSD1 represses a neonatal/reparative gene program in adult intestinal epithelium.            	Intestinal epithelial homeostasis is maintained by adult intestinal stem cells, which, alongside Paneth cells, appear after birth in the neonatal period. We aimed to identify regulators of neonatal intestinal epithelial development by testing a small library of epigenetic modifier inhibitors in Paneth cell-skewed organoid cultures. We found that lysine-specific demethylase 1A (Kdm1a/Lsd1) is absolutely required for Paneth cell differentiation. Lsd1-deficient crypts, devoid of Paneth cells, are still able to form organoids without a requirement of exogenous or endogenous Wnt. Mechanistically, we find that LSD1 enzymatically represses genes that are normally expressed only in fetal and neonatal epithelium. This gene profile is similar to what is seen in repairing epithelium, and we find that Lsd1-deficient epithelium has superior regenerative capacities after irradiation injury. In summary, we found an important regulator of neonatal intestinal development and identified a druggable target to reprogram intestinal epithelium toward a reparative state.

33528867        	Enhancing cancer-associated fibroblast fatty acid catabolism within a metabolically challenging tumor microenvironment drives colon cancer peritoneal metastasis.            	Most cancer-related deaths result from the progressive growth of metastases. Patients with peritoneal metastatic (PM) colorectal cancer have reduced overall survival. Currently, it is still unclear why colorectal cancer (CRC) cells home to and proliferate inside the peritoneal cavity, and there is no effective consolidation therapy for improved survival. Using a proteomic approach, we found that key enzymes of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) were decreased in patients with PM colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we confirmed that carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA (CPT1A), a rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, was expressed at significantly low levels in patients with PM colorectal cancer, as determined by RT-qPCR, IHC, and GEO dataset analysis. However, lipidomics revealed no difference in FFA levels between PM and non-PM primary tumors. Here, we showed that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of colon cancer cells via upregulating CPT1A to actively oxidize FAs and conduct minimal glycolysis. In addition, coculture-induced glycolysis increased in cancer cells while fatty acid catabolism decreased with lower adiponectin levels. Importantly, inhibition of glycolysis significantly reduced the survival of CRC cells after incubation with conditioned medium from CAFsCPT1A-OE in vitro and impaired the survival and growth of organoids derived from CRC-PM. Finally, we found that directly blocking FAO in CAFsCPT1A-OE with etomoxir inhibits migration and invasion in vitro and decreases tumor growth and intraperitoneal dissemination in vivo, revealing a role for CAF CPT1A in promoting tumor growth and invasion. In conclusion, our results suggest the possibility of testing FAO inhibition as a novel approach and clinical strategy against CAF-induced colorectal cancer with peritoneal dissemination/metastases.                © 2021 The Authors.

33002892        	A consensus developed morphological re-evaluation of 196 high-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms and its clinical correlations.            	High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NEN) are classified according to morphology as well differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NET) G3 or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). Little data exist concerning which morphological criteria this subdivision should be based on. Uncertainty exists if the NEC group should be further subdivided according to proliferation rate. Clinical data on NET G3 and NEC with a lower Ki-67 range are limited. 213 patients with high-grade GEP-NEN (Ki-67>20%) were included from the Nordic NEC Registries. Four experienced NET pathologists re-evaluated the cases to develop the best morphological criteria to separate NET G3 from NEC, assuming longer survival in NET G3. Organoid growth pattern, capillary network in direct contact to tumour cells and absence of desmoplastic stroma were found to best separate NET G3 from NEC. Of 196 patients with metastatic disease, NET G3 was found in 12.3%, NEC with a Ki-67<55% (NEC <55) in 29.6%, and NEC with a Ki-67≥55% (NEC ≥55) in 56.6%. Only in 1.5% the morphology was ambiguous. Of 164 patients receiving 1-line chemotherapy, 88% received platinum/etoposide treatment. Response-rate was higher for NEC ≥55 (44%) compared to NEC <55 (25%) and NET G3 (24%) (P=0.025 and P=0.026). Median progression free survival was 5 months for all groups. Median overall survival was 33 months for NET G3 compared to 11 months for both NEC <55 and NEC ≥55 (P=0.004 and 0.003).                © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.	
27941881        	The NADPH oxidase NOX4 represses epithelial to amoeboid transition and efficient tumour dissemination.            	Epithelial to mesenchymal transition is a common event during tumour dissemination. However, direct epithelial to amoeboid transition has not been characterized to date. Here we provide evidence that cells from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a highly metastatic cancer, undergo epithelial to amoeboid transition in physiological environments, such as organoids or three-dimensional complex matrices. Furthermore, the NADPH oxidase NOX4 inhibits this transition and therefore suppresses efficient amoeboid bleb-based invasion. Moreover, NOX4 expression is associated with E-cadherin levels and inversely correlated with invasive features. NOX4 is necessary to maintain parenchymal structures, increase cell-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion, and impair actomyosin contractility and amoeboid invasion. Importantly, NOX4 gene deletions are frequent in HCC patients, correlating with higher tumour grade. Contrary to that observed in mesenchymal cell types, here NOX4 suppresses Rho and Cdc42 GTPase expression and downstream actomyosin contractility. In HCC patients, NOX4 expression inversely correlates with RhoC and Cdc42 levels. Moreover, low expression of NOX4 combined with high expression of either RhoC or Cdc42 is associated with worse prognosis. Therefore, loss of NOX4 increases actomyosin levels and favours an epithelial to amoeboid transition contributing to tumour aggressiveness.	
25725293        	Helicobacter pylori Activates and Expands Lgr5(+) Stem Cells Through Direct Colonization of the Gastric Glands.            	Helicobacter pylori infection is the main risk factor for gastric cancer. We characterized the interactions of H pylori with gastric epithelial progenitor and stem cells in humans and mice and investigated how these interactions contribute to H pylori-induced pathology.                We used quantitative confocal microscopy and 3-dimensional reconstruction of entire gastric glands to determine the localizations of H pylori in stomach tissues from humans and infected mice. Using lineage tracing to mark cells derived from leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5-positive (Lgr5(+)) stem cells (Lgr5-eGFP-IRES-CreERT2/Rosa26-TdTomato mice) and in situ hybridization, we analyzed gastric stem cell responses to infection. Isogenic H pylori mutants were used to determine the role of specific virulence factors in stem cell activation and pathology.                H pylori grow as distinct bacterial microcolonies deep in the stomach glands and interact directly with gastric progenitor and stem cells in tissues from mice and humans. These gland-associated bacteria activate stem cells, increasing the number of stem cells, accelerating Lgr5(+) stem cell proliferation, and up-regulating expression of stem cell-related genes. Mutant bacteria with defects in chemotaxis that are able to colonize the stomach surface but not the antral glands in mice do not activate stem cells. In addition, bacteria that are unable to inject the contact-dependent virulence factor CagA into the epithelium colonized stomach glands in mice, but did not activate stem cells or produce hyperplasia to the same extent as wild-type H pylori.                H pylori colonize and manipulate the progenitor and stem cell compartments, which alters turnover kinetics and glandular hyperplasia. Bacterial ability to alter the stem cells has important implications for gastrointestinal stem cell biology and H pylori-induced gastric pathology.                Copyright © 2015 AGA Institute.

31486581        	Estimation of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy.            	Monitoring of cell metabolism represents an important application area for fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). In particular, assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in complex three-dimensional multicellular in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models would enable improved segmentation and functional discrimination of cell types, directly report on the mitochondrial function and complement the quenched-phosphorescence detection of cellular O2 and two-photon excited FLIM of endogenous NAD(P)H. Here, we report the green and orange-emitting fluorescent dyes SYTO and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) as potential FLIM probes for MMP. In addition to nuclear, SYTO 16 and 24 dyes also display mitochondrial accumulation. FLIM with the culture of human colon cancer HCT116 cells allowed observation of the heterogeneity of mitochondrial polarization during the cell cycle progression. The dyes also demonstrated good performance with 3D cultures of Lgr5-GFP mouse intestinal organoids, providing efficient and quick cell staining and compatibility with two-photon excitation. Multiplexed imaging of Lgr5-GFP, proliferating cells (Hoechst 33342-aided FLIM), and TMRM-FLIM allowed us to identify the population of metabolically active cells in stem cell niche. TMRM-FLIM enabled to visualize the differences in membrane potential between Lgr5-positive and other proliferating and differentiated cell types. Altogether, SYTO 24 and TMRM dyes represent promising markers for advanced FLIM-based studies of cell bioenergetics with complex 3D and in vivo models. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.                © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.	
26978773        	Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Bioavailability Regulates Angiogenesis and Intestinal Stem and Progenitor Cell Proliferation during Postnatal Small Intestinal Development.            	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a highly conserved, master regulatory molecule required for endothelial cell proliferation, organization, migration and branching morphogenesis. Podocoryne carnea and drosophila, which lack endothelial cells and a vascular system, express VEGF homologs, indicating potential roles beyond angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. The role of VEGF in the development and homeostasis of the postnatal small intestine is unknown. We hypothesized regulating VEGF bioavailability in the postnatal small intestine would exhibit effects beyond the vasculature and influence epithelial cell stem/progenitor populations.                VEGF mutant mice were created that overexpressed VEGF in the brush border of epithelium via the villin promotor following doxycycline treatment. To decrease VEGF bioavailability, sFlt-1 mutant mice were generated that overexpressed the soluble VEGF receptor sFlt-1 upon doxycycline administration in the intestinal epithelium. Mice were analyzed after 21 days of doxycycline administration.                Increased VEGF expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR and ELISA in the intestine of the VEGF mutants compared to littermates. The VEGF mutant duodenum demonstrated increased angiogenesis and vascular leak as compared to littermate controls. The VEGF mutant duodenum revealed taller villi and increased Ki-67-positive cells in the transit-amplifying zone with reduced Lgr5 expression. The duodenum of sFlt-1 mutants revealed shorter villi and longer crypts with reduced proliferation in the transit-amplifying zone, reduced expression of Dll1, Bmp4 and VE-cadherin, and increased expression of Sox9 and EphB2.                Manipulating VEGF bioavailability leads to profound effects on not only the intestinal vasculature, but epithelial stem and progenitor cells in the intestinal crypt. Elucidation of the crosstalk between VEGF signaling in the vasculature, mesenchyme and epithelial stem/progenitor cell populations may direct future cell therapies for intestinal dysfunction or disease.	
33328632        	Creation of bladder assembloids mimicking tissue regeneration and cancer.            	Current organoid models are limited by their inability to mimic mature organ architecture and associated tissue microenvironments1,2. Here we create multilayer bladder 'assembloids' by reconstituting tissue stem cells with stromal components to represent an organized architecture with an epithelium surrounding stroma and an outer muscle layer. These assembloids exhibit characteristics of mature adult bladders in cell composition and gene expression at the single-cell transcriptome level, and recapitulate in vivo tissue dynamics of regenerative responses to injury. We also develop malignant counterpart tumour assembloids to recapitulate the in vivo pathophysiological features of urothelial carcinoma. Using the genetically manipulated tumour-assembloid platform, we identify tumoural FOXA1, induced by stromal bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), as a master pioneer factor that drives enhancer reprogramming for the determination of tumour phenotype, suggesting the importance of the FOXA1-BMP-hedgehog signalling feedback axis between tumour and stroma in the control of tumour plasticity.	
25594015        	A novel role for the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 in cancer metastasis.            	Tumor metastasis contributes to the grave morbidity and mortality of cancer, but the mechanisms underlying tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that expression of the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 suppresses TGFβ-induced activation of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP2 in human breast cancer cells. We also find that knockdown of endogenous PIAS1 or inhibition of its SUMO E3 ligase activity stimulates the ability of TGFβ to induce an aggressive phenotype in three-dimensional breast cancer cell organoids. Importantly, inhibition of the SUMO E3-ligase activity of PIAS1 in breast cancer cells promotes metastases in mice in vivo. Collectively, our findings define a novel and critical role for the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 in the regulation of the invasive and metastatic potential of malignant breast cancer cells. These findings advance our understanding of cancer invasiveness and metastasis with potential implications for the development of biomarkers and therapies in breast cancer.	
33113379        	In Vitro Recapitulation of Murine Thymopoiesis from Single Hematopoietic Stem Cells.            	We report a serum-free, 3D murine artificial thymic organoid (M-ATO) system that mimics normal murine thymopoiesis with the production of all T cell stages, from early thymic progenitors to functional single-positive (CD8SP and CD4SP) TCRαβ and TCRγδ cells. RNA sequencing aligns M-ATO-derived populations with phenotypically identical primary thymocytes. M-ATOs initiated with Rag1-/- marrow produce the same differentiation block as seen in the endogenous thymus, and Notch signaling patterns in M-ATOs mirror primary thymopoiesis. M-ATOs initiated with defined hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and lymphoid progenitors from marrow and thymus generate each of the downstream differentiation stages, allowing the kinetics of T cell differentiation to be tracked. Remarkably, single HSCs deposited into each M-ATO generate the complete trajectory of T cell differentiation, producing diverse TCR repertoires across clones that largely match endogenous thymus. M-ATOs represent a highly reproducible and efficient experimental platform for the interrogation of clonal thymopoiesis from HSCs.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

33385163        	CDC25B partners with PP2A to induce AMPK activation and tumor suppression in triple negative breast cancer.            	Cell division cycle 25 (CDC25) dual specificity phosphatases positively regulate the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinase/cyclin complexes. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, CDC25B functions as a regulator of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major cellular Ser/Thr phosphatase, through its direct interaction with PP2A catalytic subunit. Importantly, CDC25B alters the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling (AMPK) by PP2A, increasing AMPK activity by inhibiting PP2A to dephosphorylate AMPK. CDC25B depletion leads to metformin resistance by inhibiting metformin-induced AMPK activation. Furthermore, dual inhibition of CDC25B and PP2A further inhibits growth of 3D organoids isolated from patient derived xenograft model of breast cancer compared to CDC25B inhibition alone. Our study identifies CDC25B as a regulator of PP2A, and uncovers a mechanism of controlling the activity of a key energy metabolism marker, AMPK.                © The Author(s) 2020.

28955710        	Human Organ Culture: Updating the Approach to Bridge the Gap from In Vitro to In Vivo in Inflammation, Cancer, and Stem Cell Biology.            	Human studies, critical for developing new diagnostics and therapeutics, are limited by ethical and logistical issues, and preclinical animal studies are often poor predictors of human responses. Standard human cell cultures can address some of these concerns but the absence of the normal tissue microenvironment can alter cellular responses. Three-dimensional cultures that position cells on synthetic matrices, or organoid or organ-on-a-chip cultures, in which different cell spontaneously organize contacts with other cells and natural matrix only partly overcome this limitation. Here, we review how human organ cultures (HOCs) can more faithfully preserve in vivo tissue architecture and can better represent disease-associated changes. We will specifically describe how HOCs can be combined with both traditional and more modern morphological techniques to reveal how anatomic location can alter cellular responses at a molecular level and permit comparisons among different cells and different cell types within the same tissue. Examples are provided involving use of HOCs to study inflammation, cancer, and stem cell biology.	
30805885        	Quantitative Imaging of Morphometric and Metabolic Signatures Reveals Heterogeneity in Drug Response of Three-Dimensional Mammary Tumor Spheroids.            	In order to monitor the drug responses of three-dimensional mammary tumor spheroids and to elucidate the role of inter- and intra-spheroid heterogeneity in determining drug sensitivity in the spheroids, an integrated image analysis framework was developed for morphometric and metabolic characterization of the three-dimensional tumor spheroids.                Three-dimensional spheroid cultures of primary mammary tumor epithelial cells isolated from freshly excised tumors from a transgenic mouse model of adenocarcinoma (MMTV-PyMT) were imaged by using vital dyes and mitochondrial membrane potential markers. Custom-developed java and python program codes facilitated image processing, numerical computation, and graphical analysis of large datasets generated from the experiments. A panel of cancer drugs (rapamycin, BEZ235, MK2206, and flavopiridol) was tested to determine the degree of drug sensitivity as well as heterogeneity in drug response.                A new quantitative metric (growth/toxicity) was developed based on morphometric parameters that were found to track the growth and apoptotic cell populations. Further, this study identified two parameters, namely, skew and kurtosis-which report the spatial heterogeneity in mitochondrial metabolism within the spheroids. The results of this study show that three-dimensional tumor spheroids selectively respond to cancer drugs depending on the specific metabolic pathways (AKT inhibition pathway in the present study), and there exists significant heterogeneity in the untreated tumor spheroids. Drug sensitivity of the spheroids was found to be associated with significant alterations in mitochondrial heterogeneity within the spheroids.                In conclusion, the quantitative imaging of morphometric and metabolic analysis in large image datasets can serve as an excellent tool box for characterizing tumor heterogeneity in three-dimensional tumor spheroids and potentially, in intact tumors as well.	
32613271        	Characterizing caspase-1 involvement during esophageal disease progression.            	Barrett's esophagus (BE) is an inflammatory condition and a neoplastic precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Inflammasome signaling, which contributes to acute and chronic inflammation, results in caspase-1 activation leading to the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis). This study aimed to characterize caspase-1 expression, and its functional importance, during disease progression to BE and EAC. Three models of disease progression (Normal-BE-EAC) were employed to profile caspase-1 expression: (1) a human esophageal cell line model; (2) a murine model of BE; and (3) resected tissue from BE-associated EAC patients. BE patient biopsies and murine BE organoids were cultured ex vivo in the presence of a caspase-1 inhibitor, to determine the importance of caspase-1 for inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion.Epithelial caspase-1 expression levels were significantly enhanced in BE (p < 0.01). In contrast, stromal caspase-1 levels correlated with histological inflammation scores during disease progression (p < 0.05). Elevated secretion of IL-1β from BE explanted tissue, compared to adjacent normal tissue (p < 0.01), confirmed enhanced activity of caspase-1 in BE tissue. Caspase-1 inhibition in LPS-stimulated murine BE organoids caused a significant reduction in IL-1β (p < 0.01) and CXCL1 (p < 0.05) secretion, confirming the importance of caspase-1 in the production of cytokines and chemokines associated with disease progression from BE to EAC. Targeting caspase-1 activity in BE patients should therefore be tested as a novel strategy to prevent inflammatory complications associated with disease progression.

31142540        	Lgr5+ stem and progenitor cells reside at the apex of a heterogeneous embryonic hepatoblast pool.            	During mouse embryogenesis, progenitors within the liver known as hepatoblasts give rise to adult hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Hepatoblasts, which are specified at E8.5-E9.0, have been regarded as a homogeneous progenitor population that initiate differentiation from E13.5. Recently, scRNA-seq analysis has identified sub-populations of transcriptionally distinct hepatoblasts at E11.5. Here, we show that hepatoblasts are not only transcriptionally but also functionally heterogeneous, and that a subpopulation of E9.5-E10.0 hepatoblasts exhibit a previously unidentified early commitment to cholangiocyte fate. Importantly, we also identify a subpopulation constituting 2% of E9.5-E10.0 hepatoblasts that express the adult stem cell marker Lgr5, and generate both hepatocyte and cholangiocyte progeny that persist for the lifespan of the mouse. Combining lineage tracing and scRNA-seq, we show that Lgr5 marks E9.5-E10.0 bipotent liver progenitors residing at the apex of a hepatoblast hierarchy. Furthermore, isolated Lgr5+ hepatoblasts can be clonally expanded in vitro into embryonic liver organoids, which can commit to either hepatocyte or cholangiocyte fates. Our study demonstrates functional heterogeneity within E9.5 hepatoblasts and identifies Lgr5 as a marker for a subpopulation of bipotent liver progenitors.                © 2019.

32032585        	Identification of Subtypes of Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Based on DNA Methylation Profiles and Integration of Transcriptome and Genome Data.            	Esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) are heterogeneous and often preceded by Barrett's esophagus (BE). Many genomic changes have been associated with development of BE and EAC, but little is known about epigenetic alterations. We performed epigenetic analyses of BE and EAC tissues and combined these data with transcriptome and genomic data to identify mechanisms that control gene expression and genome integrity.                In a retrospective cohort study, we collected tissue samples and clinical data from 150 BE and 285 EAC cases from the Oesophageal Cancer Classification and Molecular Stratification consortium in the United Kingdom. We analyzed methylation profiles of all BE and EAC tissues and assigned them to subgroups using non-negative matrix factorization with k-means clustering. Data from whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome studies were then incorporated; we performed integrative methylation and RNA-sequencing analyses to identify genes that were suppressed with increased methylation in promoter regions. Levels of different immune cell types were computed using single-sample gene set enrichment methods. We derived 8 organoids from 8 EAC tissues and tested their sensitivity to different drugs.                BE and EAC samples shared genome-wide methylation features, compared with normal tissues (esophageal, gastric, and duodenum; controls) from the same patients and grouped into 4 subtypes. Subtype 1 was characterized by DNA hypermethylation with a high mutation burden and multiple mutations in genes in cell cycle and receptor tyrosine signaling pathways. Subtype 2 was characterized by a gene expression pattern associated with metabolic processes (ATP synthesis and fatty acid oxidation) and lack methylation at specific binding sites for transcription factors; 83% of samples of this subtype were BE and 17% were EAC. The third subtype did not have changes in methylation pattern, compared with control tissue, but had a gene expression pattern that indicated immune cell infiltration; this tumor type was associated with the shortest time of patient survival. The fourth subtype was characterized by DNA hypomethylation associated with structure rearrangements, copy number alterations, with preferential amplification of CCNE1 (cells with this gene amplification have been reported to be sensitive to CDK2 inhibitors). Organoids with reduced levels of MGMT and CHFR expression were sensitive to temozolomide and taxane drugs.                In a comprehensive integrated analysis of methylation, transcriptome, and genome profiles of more than 400 BE and EAC tissues, along with clinical data, we identified 4 subtypes that were associated with patient outcomes and potential responses to therapy.

31731200        	Genomic Profiling of Biliary Tract Cancer Cell Lines Reveals Molecular Subtypes and Actionable Drug Targets.            	Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) currently have no approved targeted therapies. Although genomic profiling of primary BTCs has identified multiple potential drug targets, accurate models are needed for their evaluation. Genomic profiling of 22 BTC cell lines revealed they harbor similar mutational signatures, recurrently mutated genes, and genomic alterations to primary tumors. Transcriptomic profiling identified two major subtypes, enriched for epithelial and mesenchymal genes, which were also evident in patient-derived organoids and primary tumors. Interrogating these models revealed multiple mechanisms of MAPK signaling activation in BTC, including co-occurrence of low-activity BRAF and MEK mutations with receptor tyrosine kinase overexpression. Finally, BTC cell lines with altered ERBB2 or FGFRs were exquisitely sensitive to specific targeted agents, whereas surprisingly, IDH1-mutant lines did not respond to IDH1 inhibitors in vitro. These findings establish BTC cell lines as robust models of primary disease, reveal specific molecular disease subsets, and highlight specific molecular vulnerabilities in these cancers.

26165838        	Deregulated hepsin protease activity confers oncogenicity by concomitantly augmenting HGF/MET signalling and disrupting epithelial cohesion.            	Hepsin belongs to a family of cell-surface serine proteases, which have sparked interest as therapeutic targets because of the accessibility of extracellular protease domain for inhibitors. Hepsin is frequently amplified and/or overexpressed in epithelial cancers, but it is not clear how enhanced hepsin expression confers a potential for oncogenicity. We show that hepsin is consistently overexpressed in more than 40% of examined breast cancers, including all major biological subtypes. The effects of doxycycline-induced hepsin overexpression were examined in mammary epithelial organoids, and we found that induced hepsin acutely downmodulates its cognate inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1). Hepsin-induced depletion of cellular HAI-1 led to a sharp increase in pericellular serine protease activity. The derepressed hepsin proteolytically activated downstream serine proteases, augmented HGF/MET signalling and caused deterioration of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes; structures important for cell cohesion and cell-basement membrane interaction. Moreover, chronic induction of hepsin considerably shortened the latency of Myc-dependent tumourigenesis in the mouse mammary gland. The serine protease and uPA system inhibitor WX-UK1, identified as a micromolar range hepsin inhibitor, prevented hepsin from augmenting HGF/MET signalling and disrupting desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. The findings suggest that the oncogenic activity of hepsin arises not only from elevated expression level but also from depletion of HAI-1, events which together trigger gain-of-function activity impacting HGF/MET signalling and epithelial cohesion. Thus, hepsin overexpression is a major oncogenic conferrer to a serine protease activity involved in breast cancer dissemination.	
32113114        	Repair and regeneration of small intestine: A review of current engineering approaches.            	The small intestine (SI) is difficult to regenerate or reconstruct due to its complex structure and functions. Recent developments in stem cell research, advanced engineering technologies, and regenerative medicine strategies bring new hope of solving clinical problems of the SI. This review will first summarize the structure, function, development, cell types, and matrix components of the SI. Then, the major cell sources for SI regeneration are introduced, and state-of-the-art biofabrication technologies for generating engineered SI tissues or models are overviewed. Furthermore, in vitro models and in vivo transplantation, based on intestinal organoids and tissue engineering, are highlighted. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed to help direct future applications for SI repair and regeneration.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

27796955        	A 3D Fibroblast-Epithelium Co-culture Model for Understanding Microenvironmental Role in Branching Morphogenesis of the Mammary Gland.            	The mammary gland consists of numerous tissue compartments, including mammary epithelium, an array of stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Bidirectional interactions between the epithelium and its surrounding stroma are essential for proper mammary gland development and homeostasis, whereas their deregulation leads to developmental abnormalities and cancer. To study the relationships between the epithelium and the stroma, development of models that could recapitulate essential aspects of these interacting systems in vitro has become necessary. Here we describe a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture assay and show that the addition of fibroblasts to mammary organoid cultures promotes the epithelium to undergo branching morphogenesis, thus allowing the role of the stromal microenvironment to be examined in this essential developmental process.	
31099450        	Interleukin-13 and its signaling pathway is associated with obesity-related colorectal tumorigenesis.            	The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been on the rise, which is linked to the increasing prevalence of obesity, based on global epidemiological evidence. Although chronic inflammation is implicated in tumor development, the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated CRC remain unknown. Here, we sought to identify the inflammatory cytokines and their roles in obesity-related colorectal tumorigenesis using cytokine array analyses in a mouse model. Colorectal tumorigenesis was induced through i.p. injection of azoxymethane once a week for 6 weeks in 6-week-old female WT C57Black/6J mice and the obesity diabetes model mouse KK/TaJcl, KK-Ay/TaJcl. The formation of aberrant crypt foci and colorectal tumors were more frequent in obese mice compared with WT mice, and both serum interleukin (IL)-13 and IL-13 receptor (R) expression in the normal intestinal mucosal epithelium were significantly increased in the obese mice. Furthermore, addition of IL-13 to a human CRC cell line and a human colon organoid culture altered the phenotype of intestinal epithelial cells. Knockdown experiments further revealed that IL-13Rα1 dominantly induced mucosal proliferation. Collectively, These results suggest an association between anti-inflammatory cytokines and colorectal carcinogenesis, and provide new research directions for cancer prevention strategies. In particular, inflammation provoked by obesity, notably by increased expression of the cytokine IL-13, could play an important role in the carcinogenesis of obesity-related CRC.                © 2019 The Authors.

23776211        	Genetic reconstitution of tumorigenesis in primary intestinal cells.            	Animal models for human colorectal cancer recapitulate multistep carcinogenesis that is typically initiated by activation of the Wnt pathway. Although potential roles of both genetic and environmental modifiers have been extensively investigated in vivo, it remains elusive whether epithelial cells definitely require interaction with stromal cells or microflora for tumor development. Here we show that tumor development could be simply induced independently of intestinal microenvironment, even with WT murine primary intestinal cells alone. We developed an efficient method for lentiviral transduction of intestinal organoids in 3D culture. Despite seemingly antiproliferative effects by knockdown of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), we managed to reproducibly induce APC-inactivated intestinal organoids. As predicted, these organoids were constitutively active in the Wnt signaling pathway and proved tumorigenic when injected into nude mice, yielding highly proliferative tubular epithelial glands accompanied by prominent stromal tissue. Consistent with cellular transformation, tumor-derived epithelial cells acquired sphere formation potential, gave rise to secondary tumors on retransplantation, and highly expressed cancer stem cell markers. Inactivation of p53 or phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10, or activation of Kras, promoted tumor development only in the context of APC suppression, consistent with earlier genetic studies. These findings clearly indicated that genetic cooperation for intestinal tumorigenesis could be essentially recapitulated in intestinal organoids without generating gene-modified mice. Taken together, this in vitro model for colon cancer described herein could potentially provide unique opportunities for carcinogenesis studies by serving as a substitute or complement to the currently standard approaches.	
29333526        	Next-Generation Rapid Autopsies Enable Tumor Evolution Tracking and Generation of Preclinical Models.            	Patients with cancer who graciously consent for autopsy represent an invaluable resource for the study of cancer biology. To advance the study of tumor evolution, metastases, and resistance to treatment, we developed a next-generation rapid autopsy program integrated within a broader precision medicine clinical trial that interrogates pre- and postmortem tissue samples for patients of all ages and cancer types.                One hundred twenty-three (22%) of 554 patients who consented to the clinical trial also consented for rapid autopsy. This report comprises the first 15 autopsies, including patients with metastatic carcinoma (n = 10), melanoma (n = 1), and glioma (n = 4). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on frozen autopsy tumor samples from multiple anatomic sites and on non-neoplastic tissue. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on a subset of frozen samples. Tissue was also used for the development of preclinical models, including tumor organoids and patient-derived xenografts.                Three hundred forty-six frozen samples were procured in total. WES was performed on 113 samples and RNA-Seq on 72 samples. Successful cell strain, tumor organoid, and/or patient-derived xenograft development was achieved in four samples, including an inoperable pediatric glioma. WES data were used to assess clonal evolution and molecular heterogeneity of tumors in individual patients. Mutational profiles of primary tumors and metastases yielded candidate mediators of metastatic spread and organotropism including CUL9 and PIGM in metastatic ependymoma and ANKRD52 in metastatic melanoma to the lung. RNA-Seq data identified novel gene fusion candidates.                A next-generation sequencing-based autopsy program in conjunction with a pre-mortem precision medicine pipeline for diverse tumors affords a valuable window into clonal evolution, metastasis, and alterations underlying treatment. Moreover, such an autopsy program yields robust preclinical models of disease.	
25658601        	CD44 plays a functional role in Helicobacter pylori-induced epithelial cell proliferation.            	The cytotoxin-associated gene (Cag) pathogenicity island is a strain-specific constituent of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) that augments cancer risk. CagA translocates into the cytoplasm where it stimulates cell signaling through the interaction with tyrosine kinase c-Met receptor, leading cellular proliferation. Identified as a potential gastric stem cell marker, cluster-of-differentiation (CD) CD44 also acts as a co-receptor for c-Met, but whether it plays a functional role in H. pylori-induced epithelial proliferation is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that CD44 plays a functional role in H. pylori-induced epithelial cell proliferation. To assay changes in gastric epithelial cell proliferation in relation to the direct interaction with H. pylori, human- and mouse-derived gastric organoids were infected with the G27 H. pylori strain or a mutant G27 strain bearing cagA deletion (∆CagA::cat). Epithelial proliferation was quantified by EdU immunostaining. Phosphorylation of c-Met was analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis for expression of CD44 and CagA. H. pylori infection of both mouse- and human-derived gastric organoids induced epithelial proliferation that correlated with c-Met phosphorylation. CagA and CD44 co-immunoprecipitated with phosphorylated c-Met. The formation of this complex did not occur in organoids infected with ∆CagA::cat. Epithelial proliferation in response to H. pylori infection was lost in infected organoids derived from CD44-deficient mouse stomachs. Human-derived fundic gastric organoids exhibited an induction in proliferation when infected with H. pylori that was not seen in organoids pre-treated with a peptide inhibitor specific to CD44. In the well-established Mongolian gerbil model of gastric cancer, animals treated with CD44 peptide inhibitor Pep1, resulted in the inhibition of H. pylori-induced proliferation and associated atrophic gastritis. The current study reports a unique approach to study H. pylori interaction with the human gastric epithelium. Here, we show that CD44 plays a functional role in H. pylori-induced epithelial cell proliferation.	
23142137        	Troy, a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member, interacts with lgr5 to inhibit wnt signaling in intestinal stem cells.            	The Wnt signaling pathway is required for maintenance of the intestinal epithelia; blocking this pathway reduces the proliferative capacity of the intestinal stem cells. However, aberrant Wnt signaling leads to intestinal cancer. We investigated the roles of the Wnt pathway in homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium and during malignant transformation in human cells and mice.                We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with DNA microarray analysis (ChIP-on-chip) to identify genes regulated by Wnt signaling in human colorectal cancer cells Colo320, DLD1, LS174T, and SW480. Formation of intestinal tumor was induced in C57BL/6J mice using azoxymethane and dextran sulfate. Intestinal tissues from these mice, as well as Apc(+/Min) and Apc(CKO/CKO)/Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 mice, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.                We identified promoter regions of 960 genes that interacted with the Wnt pathway nuclear effector T-cell factor 4 in 4 different human colorectal cancer-derived cell lines; 18 of these promoters were present in all chromatin precipitates. Wnt signaling up-regulated a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily called TROY. Levels of TROY messenger RNA were increased in human cells with deficiencies in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and in cells stimulated with the Wnt3a ligand. Expression of Troy was significantly up-regulated in neoplastic tissues from mice during intestinal tumorigenesis. Lineage tracing experiments revealed that Troy is produced specifically by fast-cycling intestinal stem cells. TROY associated with a unique marker of these cells, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor (LGR) 5. In organoids established from the intestinal crypts, Troy suppressed signaling mediated by R-spondin, a Wnt agonist.                TROY is up-regulated in human colorectal cancer cell lines and in intestinal tumors in mice. It functions as a negative modulator of the Wnt pathway in LGR5-positive stem cells.

25894653        	Perturbation-expression analysis identifies RUNX1 as a regulator of human mammary stem cell differentiation.            	The search for genes that regulate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation has been hindered by a paucity of markers that uniquely label stem cells and early progenitors. To circumvent this difficulty we have developed a method that identifies cell-state regulators without requiring any markers of differentiation, termed Perturbation-Expression Analysis of Cell States (PEACS). We have applied this marker-free approach to screen for transcription factors that regulate mammary stem cell differentiation in a 3D model of tissue morphogenesis and identified RUNX1 as a stem cell regulator. Inhibition of RUNX1 expanded bipotent stem cells and blocked their differentiation into ductal and lobular tissue rudiments. Reactivation of RUNX1 allowed exit from the bipotent state and subsequent differentiation and mammary morphogenesis. Collectively, our findings show that RUNX1 is required for mammary stem cells to exit a bipotent state, and provide a new method for discovering cell-state regulators when markers are not available.	
31207547        	Telomere Maintenance-Associated PML Is a Potential Specific Therapeutic Target of Human Colorectal Cancer.            	Telomere length maintenance is essential for cell proliferation, which is particularly prominent in cancer. We validate that the primary colorectal tumors exhibit heterogeneous telomere lengths but mostly (90%) short telomeres relative to normal tissues. Intriguingly, relatively short telomeres are associated with tumor malignancy as indicated by poorly differentiated state, and these tumors contain more cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) identified by several commonly used markers CD44, EPHB2 or LGR5. Moreover, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and ALT-associated PML nuclear bodies (APBs) are frequently found in tumors with short telomeres and high proliferation. In contrast, distant normal tissues rarely or only minimally express PML. Inhibition of PML and APBs by an ATR inhibitor decreases proliferation of CSLCs and organoids, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to progressive colorectal tumors. Together, telomere maintenance underling tumor progression is connected with CSLCs.                Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
27951586        	NLRC3 is an inhibitory sensor of PI3K-mTOR pathways in cancer.            	NLRs (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeats) belong to a large family of cytoplasmic sensors that regulate an extraordinarily diverse range of biological functions. One of these functions is to contribute to immunity against infectious diseases, but dysregulation of their functional activity leads to the development of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Cytoplasmic innate immune sensors, including NLRs, are central regulators of intestinal homeostasis. NLRC3 (also known as CLR16.2 or NOD3) is a poorly characterized member of the NLR family and was identified in a genomic screen for genes encoding proteins bearing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and nucleotide-binding domains. Expression of NLRC3 is drastically reduced in the tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer compared to healthy tissues, highlighting an undefined potential function for this sensor in the development of cancer. Here we show that mice lacking NLRC3 are hyper-susceptible to colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis. The effect of NLRC3 is most dominant in enterocytes, in which it suppresses activation of the mTOR signalling pathways and inhibits cellular proliferation and stem-cell-derived organoid formation. NLRC3 associates with PI3Ks and blocks activation of the PI3K-dependent kinase AKT following binding of growth factor receptors or Toll-like receptor 4. These findings reveal a key role for NLRC3 as an inhibitor of the mTOR pathways, mediating protection against colorectal cancer.	
33562088        	Gel-Free 3D Tumoroids with Stem Cell Properties Modeling Drug Resistance to Cisplatin and Imatinib in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.            	Researchers have developed several three-dimensional (3D) culture systems, including spheroids, organoids, and tumoroids with increased properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs), also called cancer-initiating cells (CICs). Drug resistance is a crucial issue involving recurrence in cancer patients. Many studies on anti-cancer drugs have been reported using 2D culture systems, whereas 3D cultured tumoroids have many advantages for assessing drug sensitivity and resistance. Here, we aimed to investigate whether Cisplatin (a DNA crosslinker), Imatinib (a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU: an antimetabolite) alter the tumoroid growth of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Gene expression signatures of highly metastatic aggregative CRC (LuM1 cells) vs. low-metastatic, non-aggregative CRC (Colon26 and NM11 cells) were analyzed using microarray. To establish a 3D culture-based multiplexing reporter assay system, LuM1 was stably transfected with the Mmp9 promoter-driven ZsGreen fluorescence reporter gene, which was designated as LuM1/m9 cells and cultured in NanoCulture Plate®, a gel-free 3D culture device. LuM1 cells highly expressed mRNA encoding ABCG2 (a drug resistance pump, i.e., CSC/CIC marker), other CSC/CIC markers (DLL1, EpCAM, podoplanin, STAT3/5), pluripotent stem cell markers (Sox4/7, N-myc, GATA3, Nanog), and metastatic markers (MMPs, Integrins, EGFR), compared to the other two cell types. Hoechst efflux stem cell-like side population was increased in LuM1 (7.8%) compared with Colon26 (2.9%), both of which were markedly reduced by verapamil treatment, an ABCG2 inhibitor. Smaller cell aggregates of LuM1 were more sensitive to Cisplatin (at 10 μM), whereas larger tumoroids with increased ABCG2 expression were insensitive. Notably, Cisplatin (2 μM) and Imatinib (10 μM) at low concentrations significantly promoted tumoroid formation (cell aggregation) and increased Mmp9 promoter activity in mCRC LuM1/m9, while not cytotoxic to them. On the other hand, 5-FU significantly inhibited tumoroid growth, although not completely. Thus, drug resistance in cancer with increased stem cell properties was modeled using the gel-free 3D cultured tumoroid system. The tumoroid culture is useful and easily accessible for the assessment of drug sensitivity and resistance.	
27819675        	Induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress by deletion of Grp78 depletes Apc mutant intestinal epithelial stem cells.            	Intestinal epithelial stem cells are highly sensitive to differentiation induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Colorectal cancer develops from mutated intestinal epithelial stem cells. The most frequent initiating mutation occurs in Apc, which results in hyperactivated Wnt signalling. This causes hyperproliferation and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy, but whether these mutated stem cells are sensitive to ER stress induced differentiation remains unknown. Here we examined this by generating mice in which both Apc and ER stress repressor chaperone Grp78 can be conditionally deleted from the intestinal epithelium. For molecular studies, we used intestinal organoids derived from these mice. Homozygous loss of Apc alone resulted in crypt elongation, activation of the Wnt signature and accumulation of intestinal epithelial stem cells, as expected. This phenotype was however completely rescued on activation of ER stress by additional deletion of Grp78. In these Apc-Grp78 double mutant animals, stem cells were rapidly lost and repopulation occurred by non-mutant cells that had escaped recombination, suggesting that Apc-Grp78 double mutant stem cells had lost self-renewal capacity. Although in Apc-Grp78 double mutant mice the Wnt signature was lost, these intestines exhibited ubiquitous epithelial presence of nuclear β-catenin. This suggests that ER stress interferes with Wnt signalling downstream of nuclear β-catenin. In conclusion, our findings indicate that ER stress signalling results in loss of Apc mutated intestinal epithelial stem cells by interference with the Wnt signature. In contrast to many known inhibitors of Wnt signalling, ER stress acts downstream of β-catenin. Therefore, ER stress poses a promising target in colorectal cancers, which develop as a result of Wnt activating mutations.	
30108106        	KMT2C Mutations in Diffuse-Type Gastric Adenocarcinoma Promote Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.            	Lauren diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinomas (DGAs) are generally genomically stable. We identified lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) as a frequently mutated gene and examined its role in DGA progression.                We performed whole exome sequencing on tumor samples of 27 patients with DGA who underwent gastrectomy. Lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) was analyzed in DGA cell lines and in patient tumors.                KMT2C was the most frequently mutated gene (11 of 27 tumors [41%]). KMT2C expression by immunohistochemistry in tumors from 135 patients with DGA undergoing gastrectomy inversely correlated with more advanced tumor stage (P = 0.023) and worse overall survival (P = 0.017). KMT2C shRNA knockdown in non-transformed HFE-145 gastric epithelial cells promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as demonstrated by increased expression of EMT-related proteins N-cadherin and Slug. Migration and invasion in gastric epithelial cells following KMT2C knockdown increased by 47- to 88-fold. In the DGA cell lines MKN-45 and SNU-668, which have lost KMT2C expression, KMT2C re-expression decreased expression of EMT-related proteins, reduced cell migration by 52% to 60%, and reduced cell invasion by 50% to 74%. Flank xenografts derived from KMT2C-expressing DGA organoids, compared with wild-type organoids, grew more slowly and lost their infiltrative leading edge. EMT can lead to the acquisition of cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotypes. KMT2C re-expression in DGA cell lines reduced spheroid formation by 77% to 78% and reversed CSC resistance to chemotherapy via promotion of DNA damage and apoptosis.                KMT2C is frequently mutated in certain populations with DGA. KMT2C loss in DGA promotes EMT and is associated with worse overall survival.                ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.	
33500430        	Farnesyl dimethyl chromanol targets colon cancer stem cells and prevents colorectal cancer metastasis.            	The activation and growth of tumour-initiating cells with stem-like properties in distant organs characterize colorectal cancer (CRC) growth and metastasis. Thus, inhibition of colon cancer stem cell (CCSC) growth holds promise for CRC growth and metastasis prevention. We and others have shown that farnesyl dimethyl chromanol (FDMC) inhibits cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We provide the first demonstration that FDMC inhibits CCSC viability, survival, self-renewal (spheroid formation), pluripotent transcription factors (Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2) expression, organoids formation, and Wnt/β-catenin signalling, as evidenced by comparisons with vehicle-treated controls. In addition, FDMC inhibits CCSC migration, invasion, inflammation (NF-kB), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), and metastasis (MMP9), which are critical tumour metastasis processes. Moreover, FDMC induced apoptosis (TUNEL, Annexin V, cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved PARP) in CCSCs and CCSC-derived spheroids and organoids. Finally, in an orthotopic (cecum-injected CCSCs) xenograft metastasis model, we show that FDMC significantly retards CCSC-derived tumour growth (Ki-67); inhibits inflammation (NF-kB), angiogenesis (VEGF and CD31), and β-catenin signalling; and induces apoptosis (cleaved PARP) in tumour tissues and inhibits liver metastasis. In summary, our results demonstrate that FDMC inhibits the CCSC metastatic phenotype and thereby supports investigating its ability to prevent CRC metastases.	
30458137        	Oxidative Stress in Cells with Extra Centrosomes Drives Non-Cell-Autonomous Invasion.            	Centrosomal abnormalities, in particular centrosome amplification, are recurrent features of human tumors. Enforced centrosome amplification in vivo plays a role in tumor initiation and progression. However, centrosome amplification occurs only in a subset of cancer cells, and thus, partly due to this heterogeneity, the contribution of centrosome amplification to tumors is unknown. Here, we show that supernumerary centrosomes induce a paracrine-signaling axis via the secretion of proteins, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), which leads to non-cell-autonomous invasion in 3D mammary organoids and zebrafish models. This extra centrosomes-associated secretory phenotype (ECASP) promotes invasion of human mammary cells via HER2 signaling activation. Further, we demonstrate that centrosome amplification induces an early oxidative stress response via increased NOX-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn mediates secretion of pro-invasive factors. The discovery that cells with extra centrosomes can manipulate the surrounding cells highlights unexpected and far-reaching consequences of these abnormalities in cancer.

33334906        	Attenuation of SRC Kinase Activity Augments PARP Inhibitor-mediated Synthetic Lethality in BRCA2-altered Prostate Tumors.            	Alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway genes occur in 20%-25% of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Although PARP inhibitors (PARPis) have been shown to benefit men with mCRPC harboring DDR defects due to mutations in BRCA1/2 and ATM, additional treatments are necessary because the effects are not durable.                We performed transcriptomic analysis of publicly available mCRPC cases, comparing BRCA2 null with BRCA2 wild-type. We generated BRCA2-null prostate cancer cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and treated these cells with PARPis and SRC inhibitors. We also assessed the antiproliferative effects of combination treatment in 3D prostate cancer organoids.                We observed significant enrichment of the SRC signaling pathway in BRCA2-altered mCRPC. BRCA2-null prostate cancer cell lines had increased SRC phosphorylation and higher sensitivity to SRC inhibitors (e.g., dasatinib, bosutinib, and saracatinib) relative to wild-type cells. Combination treatment with PARPis and SRC inhibitors was antiproliferative and had a synergistic effect in BRCA2-null prostate cancer cells, mCRPC organoids, and Trp53/Rb1-null prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of SRC signaling by dasatinib augmented DNA damage in BRCA2-null prostate cancer cells. Moreover, SRC knockdown increased PARPi sensitivity in BRCA2-null prostate cancer cells.                This work suggests that SRC activation may be a potential mechanism of PARPi resistance and that treatment with SRC inhibitors may overcome this resistance. Our preclinical study demonstrates that combining PARPis and SRC inhibitors may be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with BRCA2-null mCRPC.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
27979841        	Modeling Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma Unveils Novel Mechanisms of Metastasis.            	Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a slowly growing, but highly metastatic, sarcoma that affects adolescents and young adults. Its characteristic alveolar structure is constituted by tumor cell nests and an abundant vascular network that is responsible for metastatic activities at the initial stage. Here, we have generated a new ex vivo mouse model for ASPS that well recapitulates associated angiogenic and metastatic phenotypes. In mouse ASPS, the tumor cells frequently showed tumor intravasation, with the intravascular tumor cells presenting as organoid structures covered with hemangiopericytes, which is also observed in human ASPS. High expression of glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB), a transcriptional target of ASPSCR1-TFE3, was observed at the sites of intravasation. ASPS tumor cells also demonstrated enhanced transendothelial migration activity, which was inhibited by silencing of Gpnmb, indicating that GPNMB plays an important role in tumor intravasation, a key step in cancer metastasis. The present model also enabled the evaluation of TFE/MITF family transcription factor function, which demonstrated that ASPSCR1-TFEB possessed definitive albeit less marked oncogenic activity than that of ASPSCR1-TFE3. Collectively, our mouse model provides a tool to understand oncogenic, angiogenic, and metastatic mechanisms of ASPS. It also identifies important motifs within the ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion protein and provides a platform for developing novel therapeutic strategies for this disorder.

30354275        	Calcifying Nested Stromal-Epithelial Tumor of the Liver: An Update and Literature Review.            	Calcifying nested stromal-epithelial tumor is a rare entity that has gone by a variety of names in the literature: ossifying malignant mixed epithelial and stromal tumor, ossifying stromal-epithelial tumor, and desmoplastic nested spindle cell tumor of the liver. To our knowledge, approximately 38 cases have been reported in the literature. The histogenesis is still largely unknown but histopathologically is characterized by nests of spindle and epithelioid cells in an organoid arrangement surrounded by a prominent dense myofibroblastic stroma with occasional psammomatous calcification and focal heterotopic ossification. Vascular invasion is rare and tumoral recurrence is uncommon with only a single reported case of metastasis leading to death. Treatment is mainly by surgical intervention with the role of chemotherapy seeming limited, but lack of data hinders a true recommendation. It is important to rule out other processes such as hepatoblastoma, calcified hemangioma, synovial sarcoma, metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, among others, which appear similar radiographically and histopathologically.	
24788003        	Na+,HCO3- -cotransport is functionally upregulated during human breast carcinogenesis and required for the inverted pH gradient across the plasma membrane.            	Metabolic and biochemical changes during breast carcinogenesis enhance cellular acid production. Extrusion of the acid load from the cancer cells raises intracellular pH, while it decreases extracellular pH creating an inverted pH gradient across the plasma membrane compared to normal cells and promoting cancer cell metabolism, proliferation, migration, and invasion. We investigated the effects of breast carcinogenesis on the mechanisms of cellular pH control using multicellular epithelial organoids freshly isolated from human primary breast carcinomas and matched normal breast tissue. Intracellular pH was measured by fluorescence microscopy, while protein expression was investigated by immunofluorescence imaging and immunoblotting. We found that cellular net acid extrusion increased during human breast carcinogenesis due to enhanced Na(+),HCO3 (-)-cotransport, which created an alkaline shift (~0.3 units of magnitude) in steady-state intracellular pH of human primary breast carcinomas compared to normal breast tissue. Na(+)/H(+)-exchange activity and steady-state intracellular pH in the absence of CO2/HCO3 (-) were practically unaffected by breast carcinogenesis. These effects were evident under both acidic (pH 6.8, representative of the tumor microenvironment) and physiological (pH 7.4) extracellular conditions. Protein expression of the Na(+),HCO3 (-)-cotransporter NBCn1 (SLC4A7), which has been linked to breast cancer susceptibility in multiple genome-wide association studies, was twofold higher in human breast carcinomas compared to matched normal breast tissue. Protein expression of the Na(+)/H(+)-exchanger NHE1 (SLC9A1) was markedly less affected. We propose that upregulated NBCn1 during human breast carcinogenesis contributes to the characteristic acid distribution within human breast carcinomas and thereby plays a pathophysiological role for breast cancer development and progression.	
31671735        	Models for Understanding Resistance to Chemotherapy in Liver Cancer.            	The lack of response to pharmacological treatment constitutes a substantial limitation in the handling of patients with primary liver cancers (PLCs). The existence of active mechanisms of chemoresistance (MOCs) in hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatoblastoma hampers the usefulness of chemotherapy. A better understanding of MOCs is needed to develop strategies able to overcome drug refractoriness in PLCs. With this aim, several experimental models are commonly used. These include in vitro cell-free assays using subcellular systems; studies with primary cell cultures; cancer cell lines or heterologous expression systems; multicellular models, such as spheroids and organoids; and a variety of in vivo models in rodents, such as subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts or chemically or genetically induced liver carcinogenesis. Novel methods to perform programmed genomic edition and more efficient techniques to isolate circulating microvesicles offer new opportunities for establishing useful experimental tools for understanding the resistance to chemotherapy in PLCs. In the present review, using three criteria for information organization: (1) level of research; (2) type of MOC; and (3) type of PLC, we have summarized the advantages and limitations of the armamentarium available in the field of pharmacological investigation of PLC chemoresistance.	
29394953        	BCN057 induces intestinal stem cell repair and mitigates radiation-induced intestinal injury.            	Radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (RIGS) results from the acute loss of intestinal stem cells (ISC), impaired epithelial regeneration, and subsequent loss of the mucosal barrier, resulting in electrolyte imbalance, diarrhea, weight loss, sepsis, and mortality. The high radiosensitivity of the intestinal epithelium limits effective radiotherapy against abdominal malignancies and limits the survival of victims of nuclear accidents or terrorism. Currently, there is no approved therapy to mitigate radiation toxicity in the intestine. Here we demonstrate that BCN057, an anti-neoplastic small molecular agent, induces ISC proliferation and promotes intestinal epithelial repair against radiation injury.                BCN057 (90 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously) was injected into C57Bl6 male mice (JAX) at 24 h following abdominal irradiation (AIR) and was continued for 8 days post-irradiation. BCN057-mediated rescue of Lgr5-positive ISC was validated in Lgr5-EGFP-Cre-ERT2 mice exposed to AIR. The regenerative response of Lgr5-positive ISC was examined by lineage tracing assay using Lgr5-EGFP-ires-CreERT2-TdT mice with tamoxifen administration to activate Cre recombinase and thereby marking the ISC and their respective progeny. Ex vivo three-dimensional organoid cultures were developed from surgical specimens of human colon or from mice jejunum and were used to examine the radio-mitigating role of BCN057 on ISC ex vivo. Organoid growth was determined by quantifying the budding crypt/total crypt ratio. Statistical analysis was performed using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and paired two-tail t test.                Treatment with BCN057 24 h after a lethal dose of AIR rescues ISC, promotes regeneration of the intestinal epithelium, and thereby mitigates RIGS. Irradiated mice without BCN057 treatment suffered from RIGS, resulting in 100% mortality within 15 days post-radiation. Intestinal organoids developed from mice jejunum or human colon demonstrated a regenerative response with BCN057 treatment and mitigated radiation toxicity. However, BCN057 did not deliver radio-protection to mouse or human colon tumor tissue.                BCN057 is a potential mitigator against RIGS and may be useful for improving the therapeutic ratio of abdominal radiotherapy. This is the first report demonstrating that a small molecular agent mitigates radiation-induced intestinal injury by inducing ISC self-renewal and proliferation.	
25109331        	Transgenic expression of oncogenic BRAF induces loss of stem cells in the mouse intestine, which is antagonized by β-catenin activity.            	Colon cancer cells frequently carry mutations that activate the β-catenin and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. Yet how oncogenic alterations interact to control cellular hierarchies during tumor initiation and progression is largely unknown. We found that oncogenic BRAF modulates gene expression associated with cell differentiation in colon cancer cells. We therefore engineered a mouse with an inducible oncogenic BRAF transgene, and analyzed BRAF effects on cellular hierarchies in the intestinal epithelium in vivo and in primary organotypic culture. We demonstrate that transgenic expression of oncogenic BRAF in the mouse strongly activated MAPK signal transduction, resulted in the rapid development of generalized serrated dysplasia, but unexpectedly also induced depletion of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) pool. Histological and gene expression analyses indicate that ISCs collectively converted to short-lived progenitor cells after BRAF activation. As Wnt/β-catenin signals encourage ISC identity, we asked whether β-catenin activity could counteract oncogenic BRAF. Indeed, we found that intestinal organoids could be partially protected from deleterious oncogenic BRAF effects by Wnt3a or by small-molecule inhibition of GSK3β. Similarly, transgenic expression of stabilized β-catenin in addition to oncogenic BRAF partially prevented loss of stem cells in the mouse intestine. We also used BRAF(V637E) knock-in mice to follow changes in the stem cell pool during serrated tumor progression and found ISC marker expression reduced in serrated hyperplasia forming after BRAF activation, but intensified in progressive dysplastic foci characterized by additional mutations that activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our study suggests that oncogenic alterations activating the MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin pathways must be consecutively and coordinately selected to assure stem cell maintenance during colon cancer initiation and progression. Notably, loss of stem cell identity upon induction of BRAF/MAPK activity may represent a novel fail-safe mechanism protecting intestinal tissue from oncogene activation.	
32041849        	The stress polarity signaling (SPS) pathway serves as a marker and a target in the leaky gut barrier: implications in aging and cancer.            	The gut barrier separates trillions of microbes from the largest immune system in the body; when compromised, a "leaky" gut barrier fuels systemic inflammation, which hastens the progression of chronic diseases. Strategies to detect and repair the leaky gut barrier remain urgent and unmet needs. Recently, a stress-polarity signaling (SPS) pathway has been described in which the metabolic sensor, AMP-kinase acts via its effector, GIV (also known as Girdin) to augment epithelial polarity exclusively under energetic stress and suppresses tumor formation. Using murine and human colon-derived organoids, and enteroid-derived monolayers (EDMs) that are exposed to stressors, we reveal that the SPS-pathway is active in the intestinal epithelium and requires a catalytically active AMP-kinase. Its pharmacologic augmentation resists stress-induced collapse of the epithelium when challenged with microbes or microbial products. In addition, the SPS-pathway is suppressed in the aging gut, and its reactivation in enteroid-derived monolayers reverses aging-associated inflammation and loss of barrier function. It is also silenced during progression of colorectal cancers. These findings reveal the importance of the SPS-pathway in the gut and highlights its therapeutic potential for treating gut barrier dysfunction in aging, cancer, and dysbiosis.                © 2020 Ghosh et al.	
30575780        	Expression of the human antimicrobial peptide β-defensin-1 is repressed by the EGFR-ERK-MYC axis in colonic epithelial cells.            	The human β-defensin-1 (HBD1) is an antimicrobial peptide constitutively expressed by epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces. In addition to its microbicidal properties, the loss of HBD1 expression in several cancers suggests that it may also have an anti-tumor activity. Here, we investigated the link between HBD1 expression and cancer signaling pathways in the human colon cancer cell lines TC7 and HT-29, and in normal human colonic primary cells, using a mini-gut organoid model. Using available datasets from patient cohorts, we found that HBD1 transcription is decreased in colorectal cancer. We demonstrated that inhibiting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) increased HBD1 expression, whereas activating EGFR repressed HBD1 expression, through the MEKK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway that ultimately regulates MYC. We finally present evidences supporting a role of MYC, together with the MIZ1 coregulator, in HBD1 regulation. Our work uncovers the role and deciphers the function of the EGFR-ERK-MYC axis as a repressor of HBD1 expression and contributes to the understanding of HBD1 suppression observed in colorectal cancer.	
31598369        	Clinical Implementation of Precision Medicine in Gastric Cancer.            	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the deadliest malignancies in the world. Currently, clinical treatment decisions are mostly made based on the extent of the tumor and its anatomy, such as tumor-node-metastasis staging. Recent advances in genome-wide molecular technology have enabled delineation of the molecular characteristics of GC. Based on this, efforts have been made to classify GC into molecular subtypes with distinct prognosis and therapeutic response. Simplified algorithms based on protein and RNA expressions have been proposed to reproduce the GC classification in the clinical field. Furthermore, a recent study established a single patient classifier (SPC) predicting the prognosis and chemotherapy response of resectable GC patients based on a 4-gene real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. GC patient stratification according to SPC will enable personalized therapeutic strategies in adjuvant settings. At the same time, patient-derived xenografts and patient-derived organoids are now emerging as novel preclinical models for the treatment of GC. These models recapitulate the complex features of the primary tumor, which is expected to facilitate both drug development and clinical therapeutic decision making. An integrated approach applying molecular patient stratification and patient-derived models in the clinical realm is considered a turning point in precision medicine in GC.

33429148        	CDK12 inhibition enhances sensitivity of HER2+ breast cancers to HER2-tyrosine kinase inhibitor via suppressing PI3K/AKT.            	Alhtough anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have radically prolonged survival and improved prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, resistance to these therapies is a constant obstacle leading to TKIs treatment failure and tumour progression.                To develop new strategies to enhance TKIs efficiency by combining synergistic gene targets, we performed panel library screening using the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout technique based on data mining across TCGA data sets and verified the candidate target in preclinical models and breast cancer high-throughput sequencing data sets.                We identified that CDK12, co-amplified with HER2 in a high frequency, is powerful to sensitise or resensitise HER2-positive breast cancer to anti-HER2 TKIs lapatinib, evidenced by patient-derived organoids in vitro and cell-derived xenograft or patient-derived xenograft in vivo. Exploring mechanisms, we found that inhibition of CDK12 attenuated PI3K/AKT signal, which usually serves as an oncogenic driver and is reactivated when HER2-positive breast cancers develop resistance to lapatinib. Combining CDK12 inhibition exerted additional suppression on p-AKT activation induced by anti-HER2 TKIs lapatinib treatment. Clinically, via DNA sequencing data for tumour tissue and peripheral blood ctDNA, we found that HER2-positive breast cancer patients with CDK12 amplification responded more insensitively to anti-HER2 treatment than those without accompanying CDK12 amplification by harbouring a markedly shortened progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS: 4.3 months versus 6.9 months; hazards ratio [HR] = 2.26 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-3.86]; P = 0.0028).                Dual inhibition of HER2/CDK12 will prominently benefit the outcomes of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer by sensitising or resensitising the tumours to anti-HER2 TKIs treatment.

30753828        	Aging-like Spontaneous Epigenetic Silencing Facilitates Wnt Activation, Stemness, and BrafV600E-Induced Tumorigenesis.            	We addressed the precursor role of aging-like spontaneous promoter DNA hypermethylation in initiating tumorigenesis. Using mouse colon-derived organoids, we show that promoter hypermethylation spontaneously arises in cells mimicking the human aging-like phenotype. The silenced genes activate the Wnt pathway, causing a stem-like state and differentiation defects. These changes render aged organoids profoundly more sensitive than young ones to transformation by BrafV600E, producing the typical human proximal BRAFV600E-driven colon adenocarcinomas characterized by extensive, abnormal gene-promoter CpG-island methylation, or the methylator phenotype (CIMP). Conversely, CRISPR-mediated simultaneous inactivation of a panel of the silenced genes markedly sensitizes to BrafV600E-induced transformation. Our studies tightly link aging-like epigenetic abnormalities to intestinal cell fate changes and predisposition to oncogene-driven colon tumorigenesis.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

29423618        	Organotypic Models of Lung Cancer.            	Human lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with nearly 2 million of new cases diagnosed each year, often too late for a successful therapeutic intervention. In this chapter, organotypic models of lung cancer will be reviewed. Ex vivo tissue explants, spheroids, organoids, and novel bioengineering approaches are currently being used to study human lung cancer. Although there is no ideal method that will fully recapitulate the complex human lung architecture, the three-dimensional (3D) organotypic models described here represent a major advance from classical two-dimensional (2D) tissue culture models. Organotypic tissue cultures are better at predicting in vivo tissue responses to anticancer drugs or carcinogenic toxins. In addition, there is also a possibility to use these systems as part of personalized medicine (e.g., to assist clinicians in selecting appropriate therapeutic choices based on individual patient-derived tissue responses to drugs in vitro). There is still a need for improvement in the 3D culture systems, such as automation for high-throughput testing and reduction of costs. However, given the large number of failed clinical trials due to safety or efficacy reasons, more attention should be given to these more physiologically relevant 3D organotypic tissue culture models.	
25043003        	Genome sequencing of normal cells reveals developmental lineages and mutational processes.            	The somatic mutations present in the genome of a cell accumulate over the lifetime of a multicellular organism. These mutations can provide insights into the developmental lineage tree, the number of divisions that each cell has undergone and the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we describe whole genomes of clonal lines derived from multiple tissues of healthy mice. Using somatic base substitutions, we reconstructed the early cell divisions of each animal, demonstrating the contributions of embryonic cells to adult tissues. Differences were observed between tissues in the numbers and types of mutations accumulated by each cell, which likely reflect differences in the number of cell divisions they have undergone and varying contributions of different mutational processes. If somatic mutation rates are similar to those in mice, the results indicate that precise insights into development and mutagenesis of normal human cells will be possible.	
33513027        	Developing models of cholangiocarcinoma to close the translational gap in cancer research.            	Introduction: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive primary liver malignancy with abysmal prognosis and increasing global incidence. Individuals afflicted with CCA often remain asymptomatic until late stages of disease, resulting in very limited possibilities for therapeutic intervention. The emergence of numerous preclinical models in vitro and in vivo has expanded the tool kit for CCA researchers; nonetheless, how these tools can be best applied to understand CCA biology and accelerate drug development requires further scrutiny. Areas covered: The paper reviews the literature on animal and organoid models of CCA (available through PubMed between September 2020 and January 2021) and examines their investigational role in CCA therapeutics. Finally, the potential of these systems for screening therapeutics to improve CCA patient outcomes is illuminated. Expert Opinion: The expansion of CCA models has yielded a diverse and interesting tool kit for preclinical research. However, investigators should consider which tools are best suited to answer key preclinical questions for real progress. A combination of advanced in vitro cell systems and in vivo testing will be necessary to accelerate translational medicine in cholangiocarcinoma.	
29438729        	Hyaluronan chemistries for three-dimensional matrix applications.            	Hyaluronan is a ubiquitous constituent of mammalian extracellular matrices and, because of its excellent intrinsic biocompatibility and chemical modification versatility, has been widely employed in a multitude of biomedical applications. In this article, we will survey the approaches used to tailor hyaluronan to specific needs of tissue engineering, regenerative and reconstructive medicine and overall biomedical research. We will also describe recent examples of applications in these broader areas, such as 3D cell culture, bioprinting, organoid biofabrication, and precision medicine that are facilitated by the use of hyaluronan as a biomaterial.

29930985        	Interleukin-17A Promotes Parietal Cell Atrophy by Inducing Apoptosis.            	Atrophic gastritis caused by chronic inflammation in the gastric mucosa leads to the loss of gastric glandular cells, including acid-secreting parietal cells. Parietal cell atrophy in a setting of chronic inflammation induces spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia, a critical step in gastric carcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which inflammation causes parietal cell atrophy and spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia are not well defined. We investigated the role of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in causing parietal cell atrophy.                A mouse model of autoimmune atrophic gastritis was used to examine IL-17A production during early and late stages of disease. Organoids derived from corpus glands were used to determine the direct effects of IL-17A on gastric epithelial cells. Immunofluorescent staining was used to examine IL-17A receptors and the direct effect of signaling on parietal cells. Mice were infected with an IL-17A-producing adenovirus to determine the effects of IL-17A on parietal cells in vivo. Finally, IL-17A neutralizing antibodies were administered to mice with active atrophic gastritis to evaluate the effects on parietal cell atrophy and metaplasia.                Increased IL-17A correlated with disease severity in mice with chronic atrophic gastritis. IL-17A caused caspase-dependent gastric organoid degeneration, which could not be rescued with a necroptosis inhibitor. Parietal cells expressed IL-17A receptors and IL-17A treatment induced apoptosis in parietal cells. Overexpressing IL-17A in vivo induced caspase-3 activation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling staining in parietal cells. Finally, IL-17A neutralizing antibody decreased parietal cell atrophy and metaplasia in mice with chronic atrophic gastritis.                These data identify IL-17A as a cytokine that promotes parietal cell apoptosis during atrophic gastritis, a precursor lesion for gastric cancer.	
33035223        	Evaluation of deacetylase inhibition in metaplastic breast carcinoma using multiple derivations of preclinical models of a new patient-derived tumor.            	Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a clinically aggressive and rare subtype of breast cancer, with similar features to basal-like breast cancers. Due to rapid growth rates and characteristic heterogeneity, MBC is often unresponsive to standard chemotherapies; and novel targeted therapeutic discovery is urgently needed. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (DACi) suppress tumor growth and metastasis through regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition axis in various cancers, including basal-like breast cancers. We utilized a new MBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) to examine the effect of DACi therapy on MBC. Cell morphology, cell cycle-associated gene expressions, transwell migration, and metastasis were evaluated in patient-derived cells and tumors after treatment with romidepsin and panobinostat. Derivations of our PDX model, including cells, spheres, organoids, explants, and in vivo implanted tumors were treated. Finally, we tested the effects of combining DACi with approved chemotherapeutics on relative cell biomass. DACi significantly suppressed the total number of lung metastasis in vivo using our PDX model, suggesting a role for DACi in preventing circulating tumor cells from seeding distal tissue sites. These data were supported by our findings that DACi reduced cell migration, populations, and expression of mesenchymal-associated genes. While DACi treatment did affect cell cycle-regulating genes in vitro, tumor growth was not affected compared to controls. Importantly, gene expression results varied depending on the cellular or tumor system used, emphasizing the importance of using multiple derivations of cancer models in preclinical therapeutic discovery research. Furthermore, DACi sensitized and produced a synergistic effect with approved oncology therapeutics on inherently resistant MBC. This study introduced a role for DACi in suppressing the migratory and mesenchymal phenotype of MBC cells through regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition axis and suppression of the CTC population. Preliminary evidence that DACi treatment in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors exerts a synergistic effect on MBC cells was also demonstrated.	
33221681        	A `one-two punch' therapy strategy to target chemoresistance in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.            	Cancer cell phenotypes evolve during a tumor's treatment. In some cases, tumor cells acquire cancer stem cell-like (CSL) traits such as resistance to chemotherapy and diminished differentiation; therefore, targeting these cells may be therapeutically beneficial. In this study we show that in progressive estrogen receptor positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancer tumors, resistant subclones that emerge following chemotherapy have increased CSL abundance. Further, in vitro organoid growth of ER+ patient cancer cells also shows that chemotherapy treatment leads to increased abundance of ALDH+/CD44+ CSL cells. Chemotherapy induced CSL abundance is blocked by treatment with a pan-HDAC inhibitor, belinostat. Belinostat treatment diminished both mammosphere formation and size following chemotherapy, indicating a decrease in progenitor CSL traits. HDAC inhibitors specific to class IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5) and IIb (HDAC6) were shown to primarily reverse the chemo-resistant CSL state. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis with patient samples showed that HDAC targets and MYC signaling were promoted by chemotherapy and inhibited upon HDAC inhibitor treatment. In summary, HDAC inhibition can block chemotherapy-induced drug resistant phenotypes with 'one-two punch' strategy in refractory breast cancer cells.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

33503832        	Preclinical Models of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Their Utility in Immunotherapy Studies.            	The advent of immunotherapy has transformed the treatment landscape for several human malignancies. Antibodies against immune checkpoints, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4, demonstrate durable clinical benefits in several cancer types. However, checkpoint blockade has failed to elicit effective anti-tumor responses in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which remains one of the most lethal malignancies with a dismal prognosis. As a result, there are significant efforts to identify novel immune-based combination regimens for PDAC, which are typically first tested in preclinical models. Here, we discuss the utility and limitations of syngeneic and genetically-engineered mouse models that are currently available for testing immunotherapy regimens. We also discuss patient-derived xenograft mouse models, human PDAC organoids, and ex vivo slice cultures of human PDAC tumors that can complement murine models for a more comprehensive approach to predict response and resistance to immunotherapy regimens.	
32213541        	Loss of Apc Rapidly Impairs DNA Methylation Programs and Cell Fate Decisions in Lgr5+ Intestinal Stem Cells.            	Colorectal cancer initiation and progression result from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Although aberrant gene expression and DNA methylation profiles are considered hallmarks of colorectal cancer development, the precise timing at which these are produced during tumor establishment remains elusive. Here we investigated the early transcriptional and epigenetic changes induced by adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) inactivation in intestinal crypts. Hyperactivation of the Wnt pathway via Apc inactivation in crypt base columnar intestinal stem cells (ISC) led to their rapid accumulation driven by an impaired molecular commitment to differentiation, which was associated with discrete alterations in DNA methylation. Importantly, inhibiting the enzymes responsible for de novo DNA methylation restored the responsiveness of Apc-deficient intestinal organoids to stimuli regulating the proliferation-to-differentiation transition in ISC.

29378905        	Overt Increase of Oxidative Stress and DNA Damage in Murine and Human Colitis and Colitis-Associated Neoplasia.            	Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a higher risk of developing colitis-associated-cancer (CAC); however, the underlying processes of disease progression are not completely understood. Here, the molecular processes of inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis were investigated using IL10-deficient mice (IL10 KO). IL10 KO mice were euthanized after development of colitis and dysplasia. IHC was performed for markers of colitis-induced DNA damage (CIDD): oxidative DNA lesions (8-oxoG), double-strand breaks (DSB; γH2AX). and DSB repair. MSI, LOH (Trp53, Apc), and global methylation (CIMP) were assessed on microdissected tissue. Comet assay for DNA damage, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting were performed on intestinal organoids from wild-type (WT) and IL10 KO mice. Sequential biopsies and surgical specimens from IBD and CAC patients were used for IHC analysis. Severity of inflammation correlated with number of dysplasia. 8-oxoG and γH2AX-positive cells were significantly increased in inflamed and dysplastic areas along with activation of DSB repair. The amount of positively stained cells strongly correlated with degree of inflammation (8-oxoG: R = 0.923; γH2AX: R = 0.858). Neither CIMP, MSI nor LOH was observed. Enhanced DSBs in IL10 KO organoids were confirmed by comet assay and increased expression of γH2AX. Human clinical specimens exhibited significantly higher γH2AX and 8-oxoG in IBD, dysplasia, and CAC compared with normal mucosa. These data indicate that inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis in IL10 KO mice and IBD patients is associated with oxidative DNA damage and overt presence of DSB.

30338036        	Isolation of cancer cells with augmented spheroid-forming capability using a novel tool equipped with removable filter.            	Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems have been used to obtain multicellular spheroidal cell aggregates, or spheroids, from cancer cells. However, it is difficult to efficiently prepare large tumor-derived spheroids from cancer cells. To circumvent this problem, we here used a tool equipped with removal membrane, called Spheroid Catch, for the selection and enrichment of large-sized and/or size-matched spheroids from human squamous cell carcinoma (SAS cells) without loss of recovery. After a five-round process of selection and enrichment, we successfully isolated a subpopulation of SAS cells with augmented spheroid-forming capability, named eSAS: the efficiency of spheroid formation is 28.5% (eSAS) vs 16.8% (parental SAS). Notably, we found that some of eSAS cells survived after exposure of high doses of cisplatin in 3D culture. Moreover, orthotopic implantation by injecting eSAS cells into the tongues of nude mice showed reduced survival rate and increased tumor growth compared with those of nude mice injected with SAS cells. These results suggest that spheroids exhibiting properties of higher spheroid forming capacity can be efficiently collected by using Spheroid Catch. Indeed, genome-wide cDNA microarray and western blot analyses demonstrated higher mRNA and protein levels of hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT), which is associated with stem maintenance in cell carcinoma by catalysing the N-palmitoylation of Hedgehog proteins, in eSAS cells than in SAS cells. We propose that Spheroid Catch could be useful for the study of spheroids, and potentially organoids, in the basic and clinical sciences, as an alternative method to other type of cell strainers.	
29897330        	Cellular aspect ratio and cell division mechanics underlie the patterning of cell progeny in diverse mammalian epithelia.            	Cell division is essential to expand, shape, and replenish epithelia. In the adult small intestine, cells from a common progenitor intermix with other lineages, whereas cell progeny in many other epithelia form contiguous patches. The mechanisms that generate these distinct patterns of progeny are poorly understood. Using light sheet and confocal imaging of intestinal organoids, we show that lineages intersperse during cytokinesis, when elongated interphase cells insert between apically displaced daughters. Reducing the cellular aspect ratio to minimize the height difference between interphase and mitotic cells disrupts interspersion, producing contiguous patches. Cellular aspect ratio is similarly a key parameter for division-coupled interspersion in the early mouse embryo, suggesting that this physical mechanism for patterning progeny may pertain to many mammalian epithelia. Our results reveal that the process of cytokinesis in elongated mammalian epithelia allows lineages to intermix and that cellular aspect ratio is a critical modulator of the progeny pattern.                © 2018, McKinley et al.	
32055386        	Bifunctional ligand design for modulating mutant p53 aggregation in cancer.            	Protein misfolding and aggregation contributes to the development of a wide range of diseases. In cancer, over 50% of diagnoses are attributed to p53 malfunction due to missense mutations, many of which result in protein misfolding and accelerated aggregation. p53 mutations also frequently result in alteration or loss of zinc at the DNA-binding site, which increases aggregation via nucleation with zinc-bound p53. Herein, we designed two novel bifunctional ligands, LI and LH , to modulate mutant p53 aggregation and restore zinc binding using a metallochaperone approach. Interestingly, only the incorporation of iodine function in LI resulted in modulation of mutant p53 aggregation, both in recombinant and cellular environments. Native mass spectrometry shows a protein-ligand interaction for LI , as opposed to LH , which is hypothesized to lead to the distinct difference in the p53 aggregation profile for the two ligands. Incorporation of a di-2-picolylamine binding unit into the ligand design provided efficient intracellular zinc uptake, resulting in metallochaperone capability for both LI and LH . The ability of LI to reduce mutant p53 aggregation results in increased restoration of p53 transcriptional function and mediates both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death pathways. We further demonstrate that LI exhibits minimal toxicity in non-cancerous organoids, and that it is well tolerated in mice. These results demonstrate that iodination of our ligand framework restores p53 function by interacting with and inhibiting mutant p53 aggregation and highlights LI as a suitable candidate for comprehensive in vivo anticancer preclinical evaluations.

26351325        	Effective Inhibition of Bone Morphogenetic Protein Function by Highly Specific Llama-Derived Antibodies.            	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) have important but distinct roles in tissue homeostasis and disease, including carcinogenesis and tumor progression. A large number of BMP inhibitors are available to study BMP function; however, as most of these antagonists are promiscuous, evaluating specific effects of individual BMPs is not feasible. Because the oncogenic role of the different BMPs varies for each neoplasm, highly selective BMP inhibitors are required. Here, we describe the generation of three types of llama-derived heavy chain variable domains (VHH) that selectively bind to either BMP4, to BMP2 and 4, or to BMP2, 4, 5, and 6. These generated VHHs have high affinity to their targets and are able to inhibit BMP signaling. Epitope binning and docking modeling have shed light into the basis for their BMP specificity. As opposed to the wide structural reach of natural inhibitors, these small molecules target the grooves and pockets of BMPs involved in receptor binding. In organoid experiments, specific inhibition of BMP4 does not affect the activation of normal stem cells. Furthermore, in vitro inhibition of cancer-derived BMP4 noncanonical signals results in an increase of chemosensitivity in a colorectal cancer cell line. Therefore, because of their high specificity and low off-target effects, these VHHs could represent a therapeutic alternative for BMP4(+) malignancies.                ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

32968068        	Multiplatform genomic profiling and magnetic resonance imaging identify mechanisms underlying intratumor heterogeneity in meningioma.            	Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors, but the molecular drivers of meningioma tumorigenesis are poorly understood. We hypothesized that investigating intratumor heterogeneity in meningiomas would elucidate biologic drivers and reveal new targets for molecular therapy. To test this hypothesis, here we perform multiplatform molecular profiling of 86 spatially-distinct samples from 13 human meningiomas. Our data reveal that regional alterations in chromosome structure underlie clonal transcriptomic, epigenomic, and histopathologic signatures in meningioma. Stereotactic co-registration of sample coordinates to preoperative magnetic resonance images further suggest that high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) distinguishes meningioma regions with proliferating cells enriched for developmental gene expression programs. To understand the function of these genes in meningioma, we develop a human cerebral organoid model of meningioma and validate the high ADC marker genes CDH2 and PTPRZ1 as potential targets for meningioma therapy using live imaging, single cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR interference, and pharmacology.	
31906080        	Nanoformulated Zoledronic Acid Boosts the Vδ2 T Cell Immunotherapeutic Potential in Colorectal Cancer.            	Aminobisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid (ZA), have shown potential in the treatment of different malignancies, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Yet, their clinical exploitation is limited by their high bone affinity and modest bioavailability. Here, ZA is encapsulated into the aqueous core of spherical polymeric nanoparticles (SPNs), whose size and architecture resemble that of biological vesicles. On Vδ2 T cells, derived from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and CRC patients, ZA-SPNs induce proliferation and trigger activation up to three orders of magnitude more efficiently than soluble ZA. These activated Vδ2 T cells kill CRC cells and tumor spheroids, and are able to migrate toward CRC cells in a microfluidic system. Notably, ZA-SPNs can also stimulate the proliferation of Vδ2 T cells from the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of CRC patients and boost their cytotoxic activity against patients' autologous tumor organoids. These data represent a first step toward the use of nanoformulated ZA for immunotherapy in CRC patients.	
21042974        	Organotypic and 3D reconstructed cultures of the human bladder and urinary tract.            	Three-dimensional organotypic cultures of human urinary tract tissue have been established as intact and reconstituted tissues, with the latter generated by combining cultured normal human urothelial (NHU) cells with an appropriate stroma. Organoids may be maintained at an air-liquid interface in static culture for periods of up to 20 weeks, with analysis by immunohistology for expression of urothelial differentiation-associated markers providing a qualitative, but objective assessment criterion. Where reconstructed using bladder cancer cell lines, the resultant organoids recapitulate the invasive characteristics of the originating tumour, but the need to use authenticated cell line stocks is emphasised. The organoid approach represents an important tool for investigating urothelial-stromal cell interactions during homeostasis and disease, and for testing bladder tissue engineering and reconstructive strategies. Potential future developments of the technique are discussed and include genetic manipulation of the urothelial cells to generate disease models and incorporation of biomaterial scaffolds to support artificial stroma development.	
30718768        	Pharmacophore-guided discovery of CDC25 inhibitors causing cell cycle arrest and tumor regression.            	CDC25 phosphatases play a key role in cell cycle transitions and are important targets for cancer therapy. Here, we set out to discover novel CDC25 inhibitors. Using a combination of computational methods, we defined a minimal common pharmacophore in established CDC25 inhibitors and performed virtual screening of a proprietary library. Based on the availability of crystal structures for CDC25A and CDC25B, we implemented a molecular docking strategy and carried out hit expansion/optimization. Enzymatic assays revealed that naphthoquinone scaffolds were the most promising CDC25 inhibitors among selected hits. At the molecular level, the compounds acted through a mixed-type mechanism of inhibition of phosphatase activity, involving reversible oxidation of cysteine residues. In 2D cell cultures, the compounds caused arrest of the cell cycle at the G1/S or at the G2/M transition. Mitotic markers analysis and time-lapse microscopy confirmed that CDK1 activity was impaired and that mitotic arrest was followed by death. Finally, the compounds induced differentiation, accompanied by decreased stemness properties, in intestinal crypt stem cell-derived Apc/K-Ras-mutant mouse organoids, and led to tumor regression and reduction of metastatic potential in zebrafish embryo xenografts used as in vivo model.	
30489554        	Primary cutaneous apocrine carcinoma arising within a nevus sebaceus.            	Nevus sebaceus (NS)(organoid nevus) is a benign follicular neoplasm that commonly occurs on the scalp, face, or neck. With time, it may give rise to benign or malignant tumors such as trichoblastoma, syringocystadenoma papilliferum, and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Rarely, other types of neoplasms may develop. We present a 76-year-old woman with several trichoblastomas as well as a primary cutaneous apocrine carcinoma arising within a preexisting NS that was treated with frozen section excision.

Barrett's esophagus (BE) is clinically significant, as it is the only known precursor lesion for esophageal adenocarcinoma. To develop improved therapies for the treatment of BE, a greater understanding of the disease process at the molecular genetic level is needed. However, achieving a greater understanding will require improved preclinical models so that the disease process can be more closely studied and novel therapies can be tested. Our concise review highlights progress in the development of preclinical models for the study of BE and identifies the most suitable model in which to test novel therapies.                © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.	
33582561        	METTL3/IGF2BP1/CD47 contributes to the sublethal heat treatment induced mesenchymal transition in HCC.            	Microwave ablation is a first-line treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while incomplete ablation induces recurrence and metastasis. However, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here we reported that sublethal heat treatment (46 °C) strongly promoted migration and EMT transition in HCC cells. Mechanistic investigation revealed that compared with 37 °C, HCC cells treated with 46 °C expressed higher level of CD47. Knockdown of CD47 significantly attenuated sublethal heat treatment stimulated migration and EMT transition. In addition, METTL3 which is the key enzyme of m6A modification was also induced by 46 °C treatment and triggered CD47 expression in HCC cells. Moreover, CD47 mRNA degradation was further proved to be stabled in the IGF2BP1-dependent manner. Importantly, sublethal heat treatment stimulated CD47 expression and EMT transition were also confirmed in patient-derived organoid. Taken together, our study suggests that METTL3/IGF2BP1/CD47 mediated EMT transition contributes to the incomplete ablation induced metastasis in HCC cells. Moreover, these findings identify the METTL3/IGF2BP1/CD47 axis as a potential therapeutic target for the microwave ablation and shed new lights on the crosstalk between incomplete heat ablation and RNA methylation.

27240165        	Secretion of protein disulphide isomerase AGR2 confers tumorigenic properties.            	The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an instrumental role in determining the spatial orientation of epithelial polarity and the formation of lumens in glandular tissues during morphogenesis. Here, we show that the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-resident protein anterior gradient-2 (AGR2), a soluble protein-disulfide isomerase involved in ER protein folding and quality control, is secreted and interacts with the ECM. Extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2) is a microenvironmental regulator of epithelial tissue architecture, which plays a role in the preneoplastic phenotype and contributes to epithelial tumorigenicity. Indeed, eAGR2, is secreted as a functionally active protein independently of its thioredoxin-like domain (CXXS) and of its ER-retention domain (KTEL), and is sufficient, by itself, to promote the acquisition of invasive and metastatic features. Therefore, we conclude that eAGR2 plays an extracellular role independent of its ER function and we elucidate this gain-of-function as a novel and unexpected critical ECM microenvironmental pro-oncogenic regulator of epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis.	
33521594        	Dysfunctional EGFR and oxidative stress-induced PKD1 signaling drive formation of DCLK1+ pancreatic stem cells.            	Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1)-positive pancreatic cancer stem cells develop at a precancerous stage and may contribute to the lack of efficacy of pancreatic cancer therapy. Although PanIN cells express oncogenic KRas and have an increased activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we demonstrate that, in DCLK1+ PanIN cells, EGFR signaling is not propagated to the nucleus. Mimicking blockage of EGFR with erlotinib in PanIN organoid culture or in p48cre;KrasG12D mice led to a significant increase in DCLK1+ PanIN cells. As a mechanism of how EGFR inhibition leads to formation of DCLK1+ cells, we identify an increase in hydrogen peroxide contributing to activation of Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1). Active PKD1 then drives stemness and abundance of DCLK1+ cells in lesions. Our data suggest a signaling mechanism that leads to the development of DCLK1+ pancreatic cancer stem cells, which can be exploited to target this population in potential therapeutic approaches.                © 2020 The Author(s).	
33340365        	Fabrication Method of a High-Density Co-Culture Tumor-Stroma Platform to Study Cancer Progression.            	Cancer has now been established as one of the most common chronic diseases due to high mortality rate. The early stage of non-invasive tumors can now be successfully treated leading to have high survival rates; however, the late stage invasive and metastatic tumors still suffer from poor treatment outcomes. Among multiple contributing factors, the role of tumor microenvironment and its complexities has been well recognized in cancer progression. Stromal cells including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, adipocytes, immune cells as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) continuously interact with malignant cells and regulate various hallmarks of cancer including tumor growth, invasion, and intravasation. To better understand the role of the interaction between tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment, numerous model systems ranging from two-dimensional (2D) assays to 3D hydrogels and in vivo murine xenografts have been utilized. While each one of these model systems exhibit certain advantages in studying biological facets of tumor progression, they are often limited to perform well-controlled mechanistic studies due to various factors including lack of tumor-stroma organotypic organization and presence of confounding biochemical and biophysical factors within the tumor microenvironment. In this regard, in the past few years, 3D in vitro microengineered model systems are becoming instrumental to precisely mimic the complexities of the native tumor microenvironment to conduct fundamental and well-designed studies for multiple purposes ranging from biological discovery to therapeutic screening. These model systems include microfluidics, micro-patterned features, and 3D organoids. In this chapter, we will outline the fabrication strategy of our microengineered 3D co-culture tumor-stromal model which comprises high-density array of tumor seeded microwells surrounded by stromal cells, such as CAFs encapsulated within collagen-based hydrogel. The developed platform provides excellent spatial organization of tumor and stromal entities with designated initial architecture and cellular positioning, therefore enabling to study the specific role of cell-cell and cell-ECM interaction on tumor proliferation/expansion, cancer cell migration as well as stromal activation. The developed platform is compatible with standard biological assays enabling gene and protein expression analyses across different types of cancer and co-culture of tumor and stromal cells.	
21508962        	Lgr4 is required for Paneth cell differentiation and maintenance of intestinal stem cells ex vivo.            	Gene inactivation of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor LGR4, a paralogue of the epithelial-stem-cell marker LGR5, results in a 50% decrease in epithelial cell proliferation and an 80% reduction in terminal differentiation of Paneth cells in postnatal mouse intestinal crypts. When cultured ex vivo, LGR4-deficient crypts or progenitors, but not LGR5-deficient progenitors, die rapidly with marked downregulation of stem-cell markers and Wnt target genes, including Lgr5. Partial rescue of this phenotype is achieved by addition of LiCl to the culture medium, but not Wnt agonists. Our results identify LGR4 as a permissive factor in the Wnt pathway in the intestine and, as such, as a potential target for intestinal cancer therapy.

33145282        	Regulation of the regeneration of intestinal stem cells after irradiation.            	Radiation enteritis is common in cancer patients with abdominal and pelvic malignant tumors that have received radiotherapy. Regeneration of intestinal stem cells is a critical process for intestine self-repairing post-irradiation. In this study, we attempted to find out the molecules that promote the regeneration of intestinal stem cells to repair the irradiation damage.                Male C57BL/6 mice were given a single dose of 12 Gy irradiation, and in vitro cultured organoids were given 6 Gy X-rays to construct the regeneration of intestinal stem cells. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for morphological observation. In situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of Lgr5, and immunofluorescence staining was adopted to detect the expression of CD44. FACS was used to sort CD44 positive cells of crypts. RNA was then extracted, and RNA-Seq was performed. The Wnt11 over-expression cell line was constructed to collect the Wnt11 conditioned medium (CM).                The results showed both Lgr5 and CD44 located at the bottom of normal crypts. The expression of Lgr5 was lower at day 3.5, 5, but recovered at day 10 post-irradiation compared with the control. However, the expression of CD44 was higher at day 3.5, 5, but recovered at day 10 post-irradiation compared with the control group. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay showed consistent results. RNA-Seq results showed that Wnt11 was over-expressed in the irradiation group. After irradiation adding Wnt11 condition medium to culture, the intestinal organoids resulted in a bigger size and more buddings of the newborn organoids compared with the control group.                The expression of CD44 increases during the radiation-induced regeneration of intestinal stem cells while Lgr5 decreases, adding Wnt11 CM can facilitate the proliferation of the newborn organoids after irradiation. Wnt11 is a potential target to promote the regeneration of intestinal stem cells to repair the radiation injury.                2020 Annals of Translational Medicine. All rights reserved.	
26527802        	Elp3 drives Wnt-dependent tumor initiation and regeneration in the intestine.            	Tumor initiation in the intestine can rapidly occur from Lgr5(+) crypt columnar stem cells. Dclk1 is a marker of differentiated Tuft cells and, when coexpressed with Lgr5, also marks intestinal cancer stem cells. Here, we show that Elp3, the catalytic subunit of the Elongator complex, is required for Wnt-driven intestinal tumor initiation and radiation-induced regeneration by maintaining a subpool of Lgr5(+)/Dclk1(+)/Sox9(+) cells. Elp3 deficiency dramatically delayed tumor appearance in Apc-mutated intestinal epithelia and greatly prolonged mice survival without affecting the normal epithelium. Specific ablation of Elp3 in Lgr5(+) cells resulted in marked reduction of polyp formation upon Apc inactivation, in part due to a decreased number of Lgr5(+)/Dclk1(+)/Sox9(+) cells. Mechanistically, Elp3 is induced by Wnt signaling and promotes Sox9 translation, which is needed to maintain the subpool of Lgr5(+)/Dclk1(+) cancer stem cells. Consequently, Elp3 or Sox9 depletion led to similar defects in Dclk1(+) cancer stem cells in ex vivo organoids. Finally, Elp3 deficiency strongly impaired radiation-induced intestinal regeneration, in part because of decreased Sox9 protein levels. Together, our data demonstrate the crucial role of Elp3 in maintaining a subpopulation of Lgr5-derived and Sox9-expressing cells needed to trigger Wnt-driven tumor initiation in the intestine.                © 2015 Ladang et al.	
28550196        	IL-6 Signaling Regulates Small Intestinal Crypt Homeostasis.            	Gut homeostasis is a tightly regulated process requiring finely tuned complex interactions between different cell types, growth factors, or cytokines and their receptors. Previous work has implicated a role for IL-6 and mucosal immune cells in intestinal regeneration following injury and in promoting inflammation and cancer. We hypothesized that IL-6 signaling could also modulate crypt homeostasis. Using mouse in vitro crypt organoid and in vivo models, this study first demonstrated that exogenous IL-6 promoted crypt organoid proliferation and increased stem cell numbers through pSTAT3 activation in Paneth cells. Immunolabeling studies showed that the IL-6 receptor was restricted to the basal membrane of Paneth cells both in vitro and in vivo and that the crypt epithelium also expressed IL-6. Either a blocking Ab to the IL-6 receptor or a neutralizing Ab to IL-6 significantly reduced in vitro basal crypt organoid proliferation and budding, and in vivo significantly reduced the number of nuclei and the number of Lgr5EGFP-positive stem cells per crypt compared with IgG-treated mice, with the number of Paneth cells per crypt also significantly reduced. Functional studies demonstrated that IL-6-induced in vitro crypt organoid proliferation and crypt budding was abrogated by the Wnt inhibitor IWP2. This work demonstrates that autocrine IL-6 signaling in the gut epithelium regulates crypt homeostasis through the Paneth cells and the Wnt signaling pathway.

31116824        	Squamous cell carcinoma with perineural involvement in nevus sebaceus.            	Nevus sebaceus (NS), also known as an organoid nevus, is a congenital skin hamartoma involving the pilosebaceous unit, epidermis, and adnexa, frequently occurring in the scalp area. During childhood, the lesion remains unchanged but may subsequently increase in size during puberty in response to hormonal release, with possible tumor development. We report a case of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) development in an NS with histologic evidence of perineural involvement on the anterior central scalp of a 13-year-old adolescent girl. We also review the management and prognosis.	
33511136        	Mitochondrial Function and Dysfunction in Dilated Cardiomyopathy.            	Cardiac tissue requires a persistent production of energy in order to exert its pumping function. Therefore, the maintenance of this function relies on mitochondria that represent the "powerhouse" of all cardiac activities. Mitochondria being one of the key players for the proper functioning of the mammalian heart suggests continual regulation and organization. Mitochondria adapt to cellular energy demands via fusion-fission events and, as a proof-reading ability, undergo mitophagy in cases of abnormalities. Ca2+ fluxes play a pivotal role in regulating all mitochondrial functions, including ATP production, metabolism, oxidative stress balance and apoptosis. Communication between mitochondria and others organelles, especially the sarcoplasmic reticulum is required for optimal function. Consequently, abnormal mitochondrial activity results in decreased energy production leading to pathological conditions. In this review, we will describe how mitochondrial function or dysfunction impacts cardiac activities and the development of dilated cardiomyopathy.

29604056        	CRIPTO promotes an aggressive tumour phenotype and resistance to treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma.            	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite increasing treatment options for this disease, prognosis remains poor. CRIPTO (TDGF1) protein is expressed at high levels in several human tumours and promotes oncogenic phenotype. Its expression has been correlated to poor prognosis in HCC. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the basis for the effects of CRIPTO in HCC. We investigated CRIPTO expression levels in three cohorts of clinical cirrhotic and HCC specimens. We addressed the role of CRIPTO in hepatic tumourigenesis using Cre-loxP-controlled lentiviral vectors expressing CRIPTO in cell line-derived xenografts. Responses to standard treatments (sorafenib, doxorubicin) were assessed directly on xenograft-derived ex vivo tumour slices. CRIPTO-overexpressing patient-derived xenografts were established and used for ex vivo drug response assays. The effects of sorafenib and doxorubicin treatment in combination with a CRIPTO pathway inhibitor were tested in ex vivo cultures of xenograft models and 3D cultures. CRIPTO protein was found highly expressed in human cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma specimens but not in those of healthy participants. Stable overexpression of CRIPTO in human HepG2 cells caused epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, increased expression of cancer stem cell markers, and enhanced cell proliferation and migration. HepG2-CRIPTO cells formed tumours when injected into immune-compromised mice, whereas HepG2 cells lacking stable CRIPTO overexpression did not. High-level CRIPTO expression in xenograft models was associated with resistance to sorafenib, which could be modulated using a CRIPTO pathway inhibitor in ex vivo tumour slices. Our data suggest that a subgroup of CRIPTO-expressing HCC patients may benefit from a combinatorial treatment scheme and that sorafenib resistance may be circumvented by inhibition of the CRIPTO pathway.

25128731        	Kidney stem cells in development, regeneration and cancer.            	The generation of nephrons during development depends on differentiation via a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) of self-renewing, tissue-specific stem cells confined to a specific anatomic niche of the nephrogenic cortex. These cells may transform to generate oncogenic stem cells and drive pediatric renal cancer. Once nephron epithelia are formed the view of post-MET tissue renal growth and maintenance by adult tissue-specific epithelial stem cells becomes controversial. Recently, genetic lineage tracing that followed clonal evolution of single kidney cells showed that the need for new cells is constantly driven by fate-restricted unipotent clonal expansions in varying kidney segments arguing against a multipotent adult stem cell model. Lineage-restriction was similarly maintained in kidney organoids grown in culture. Importantly, kidney cells in which Wnt was activated were traced to give significant clonal progeny indicating a clonogenic hierarchy. In vivo nephron epithelia may be endowed with the capacity akin to that of unipotent epithelial stem/progenitor such that under specific stimuli can clonally expand/self renew by local proliferation of mature differentiated cells. Finding ways to ex vivo preserve and expand the observed in vivo kidney-forming capacity inherent to both the fetal and adult kidneys is crucial for taking renal regenerative medicine forward. Some of the strategies used to achieve this are sorting human fetal nephron stem/progenitor cells, growing adult nephrospheres or reprogramming differentiated kidney cells toward expandable renal progenitors.

Extracellular signals such as TGF-β can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancers of epithelial origin, promoting molecular and phenotypical changes resulting in pro-metastatic characteristics. We identified C/EBPα as one of the most TGF-β-mediated downregulated transcription factors in human mammary epithelial cells. C/EBPα expression prevents TGF-β-driven EMT by inhibiting expression of known EMT factors. Depletion of C/EBPα is sufficient to induce mesenchymal-like morphology and molecular features, while cells that had undergone TGF-β-induced EMT reverted to an epithelial-like state upon C/EBPα re-expression. In vivo, mice injected with C/EBPα-expressing breast tumor organoids display a dramatic reduction of metastatic lesions. Collectively, our results show that C/EBPα is required for maintaining epithelial homeostasis by repressing the expression of key mesenchymal markers, thereby preventing EMT-mediated tumorigenesis. These data suggest that C/EBPα is a master epithelial "gatekeeper" whose expression is required to prevent unwarranted mesenchymal transition, supporting an important role for EMT in mediating breast cancer metastasis.	
27803029        	Prkar1a gene knockout in the pancreas leads to neuroendocrine tumorigenesis.            	Carney complex (CNC) is a rare disease associated with multiple neoplasias, including a predisposition to pancreatic tumors; it is caused most frequently by the inactivation of the PRKAR1A gene, a regulator of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent kinase (PKA). The method used was to create null alleles of prkar1a in mouse cells expressing pdx1 (Δ-Prkar1a). We found that these mice developed endocrine or mixed endocrine/acinar cell carcinomas with 100% penetrance by the age of 4-5 months. Malignant behavior of the tumors was seen as evidenced by stromal invasion and metastasis to locoregional lymph nodes. Histologically, most tumors exhibited an organoid pattern as seen in the islet-cell tumors. Biochemically, the lesions exhibited high PKA activity, as one would expect from deleting prkar1a The primary neuroendocrine nature of these tumor cells was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy, the latter revealing the characteristic granules. Although the Δ-Prkar1a mice developed hypoglycemia after overnight fasting, insulin and glucagon levels in the plasma were normal. Negative immunohistochemical staining for the most commonly produced peptides (insulin, c-peptide, glucagon, gastrin and somatostatin) suggested that these tumors were non-functioning. We hypothesize that the recently identified multipotent pdx1+/insulin- cell in adult pancreas, gives rise to endocrine or mixed endocrine/acinar pancreatic malignancies with complete prkar1a deficiency. In conclusion, this mouse model supports the role of prkar1a as a tumor suppressor gene in the pancreas and points to the PKA pathway as a possible therapeutic target for these lesions.                © 2017 Society for Endocrinology.	
31782844        	Biomaterials as Tools to Decode Immunity.            	The immune system has remarkable capabilities to combat disease with exquisite selectivity. This feature has enabled vaccines that provide protection for decades and, more recently, advances in immunotherapies that can cure some cancers. Greater control over how immune signals are presented, delivered, and processed will help drive even more powerful options that are also safe. Such advances will be underpinned by new tools that probe how immune signals are integrated by immune cells and tissues. Biomaterials are valuable resources to support this goal, offering robust, tunable properties. The growing role of biomaterials as tools to dissect immune function in fundamental and translational contexts is highlighted. These technologies can serve as tools to understand the immune system across molecular, cellular, and tissue length scales. A common theme is exploiting biomaterial features to rationally direct how specific immune cells or organs encounter a signal. This precision strategy, enabled by distinct material properties, allows isolation of immunological parameters or processes in a way that is challenging with conventional approaches. The utility of these capabilities is demonstrated through examples in vaccines for infectious disease and cancer immunotherapy, as well as settings of immune regulation that include autoimmunity and transplantation.                © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

29483153        	Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) ablation promotes tissue fibrosis and hypoxia to induce aggressive basal-like breast cancers.            	The discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is overexpressed in breast carcinoma cells. Low DDR1 expression is associated with worse relapse-free survival, reflecting its controversial role in cancer progression. We detected DDR1 on luminal cells but not on myoepithelial cells of DDR1+/+ mice. We found that DDR1 loss compromises cell adhesion, consistent with data that older DDR1-/- mammary glands had more basal/myoepithelial cells. Basal cells isolated from older mice exerted higher traction forces than the luminal cells, in agreement with increased mammary branches observed in older DDR1-/- mice and higher branching by their isolated organoids. When we crossed DDR1-/- mice with MMTV-PyMT mice, the PyMT/DDR1-/- mammary tumors grew faster and had increased epithelial tension and matricellular fibrosis with a more basal phenotype and increased lung metastases. DDR1 deletion induced basal differentiation of CD90+CD24+ cancer cells, and the increase in basal cells correlated with tumor cell mitoses. K14+ basal cells, including K8+K14+ cells, were increased adjacent to necrotic fields. These data suggest that the absence of DDR1 provides a growth and adhesion advantage that favors the expansion of basal cells, potentiates fibrosis, and enhances necrosis/hypoxia and basal differentiation of transformed cells to increase their aggression and metastatic potential.                © 2018 Takai et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.	
31811055        	T cell-derived interferon-γ programs stem cell death in immune-mediated intestinal damage.            	Despite the importance of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) for epithelial maintenance, there is limited understanding of how immune-mediated damage affects ISCs and their niche. We found that stem cell compartment injury is a shared feature of both alloreactive and autoreactive intestinal immunopathology, reducing ISCs and impairing their recovery in T cell-mediated injury models. Although imaging revealed few T cells near the stem cell compartment in healthy mice, donor T cells infiltrating the intestinal mucosa after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) primarily localized to the crypt region lamina propria. Further modeling with ex vivo epithelial cultures indicated ISC depletion and impaired human as well as murine organoid survival upon coculture with activated T cells, and screening of effector pathways identified interferon-γ (IFNγ) as a principal mediator of ISC compartment damage. IFNγ induced JAK1- and STAT1-dependent toxicity, initiating a proapoptotic gene expression program and stem cell death. BMT with IFNγ-deficient donor T cells, with recipients lacking the IFNγ receptor (IFNγR) specifically in the intestinal epithelium, and with pharmacologic inhibition of JAK signaling all resulted in protection of the stem cell compartment. In addition, epithelial cultures with Paneth cell-deficient organoids, IFNγR-deficient Paneth cells, IFNγR-deficient ISCs, and purified stem cell colonies all indicated direct targeting of the ISCs that was not dependent on injury to the Paneth cell niche. Dysregulated T cell activation and IFNγ production are thus potent mediators of ISC injury, and blockade of JAK/STAT signaling within target tissue stem cells can prevent this T cell-mediated pathology.

30376595        	The tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 confers resistance to colonic inflammation by driving goblet cell function and crypt regeneration.            	The Src homology-2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) regulates many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and survival. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding SHP-2 are associated with an increased susceptibility to develop ulcerative colitis. We recently reported that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of Shp-2 in mice (Shp-2IEC-KO ) leads to chronic colitis and colitis-associated cancer. This suggests that SHP-2-dependent signaling protects the colonic epithelium against inflammation and colitis-associated cancer development. To verify this hypothesis, we generated mice expressing the Shp-2 E76K activated form specifically in IEC. Our results showed that sustained Shp-2 activation in IEC increased intestine and crypt length, correlating with increased cell proliferation and migration. Crypt regeneration capacity was also markedly enhanced, as revealed by ex vivo organoid culture. Shp-2 activation alters the secretory cell lineage, as evidenced by increased goblet cell numbers and mucus secretion. Notably, these mice also demonstrated elevated ERK signaling in IEC and exhibited resistance against both chemical- and Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis. In contrast, mice with IEC-specific Shp-2 deletion displayed reduced ERK signaling and rapidly developed chronic colitis. Remarkably, expression of an activated form of Braf in Shp-2-deficient mice restored ERK activation, goblet cell production and prevented colitis. Altogether, our results indicate that chronic activation of Shp-2/ERK signaling in the colonic epithelium confers resistance to mucosal erosion and colitis. © 2018 The Authors.

29627364        	Animal models of cholangiocarcinoma.            	Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive biliary tract malignancy with a poor overall prognosis. There is a critical need to develop effective targeted therapies for the treatment of this lethal disease. In an effort to address this challenge, preclinical in vivo studies have become paramount in understanding CCA carcinogenesis, progression, and therapy. Various CCA animal models exist including carcinogen-based models in which animals develop CCA after exposure to a carcinogen, genetically engineered mouse models in which genetic changes are induced in mice leading to CCA, murine syngeneic orthotopic models, as well as xenograft tumors derived from xenotransplantation of CCA cells, organoids, and patient-derived tissue. Each type has distinct advantages as well as shortcomings. In the ideal animal model of CCA, the tumor arises from the biliary tract in an immunocompetent host with a species-matched tumor microenvironment. Such a model would also be time-efficient, recapitulate the genetic and histopathological features of human CCA, and predict therapeutic response in humans. Recently developed biliary tract transduction and orthotopic syngeneic transplant mouse models encompass several of these elements. Herein, we review the different animal models of CCA, their advantages and deficiencies, as well as features which mimic human CCA.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
23152864        	Longitudinal study of mammary epithelial and fibroblast co-cultures using optical coherence tomography reveals morphological hallmarks of pre-malignancy.            	The human mammary gland is a complex and heterogeneous organ, where the interactions between mammary epithelial cells (MEC) and stromal fibroblasts are known to regulate normal biology and tumorigenesis. We aimed to longitudinally evaluate morphology and size of organoids in 3D co-cultures of normal (MCF10A) or pre-malignant (MCF10DCIS.com) MEC and hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts from reduction mammoplasty (RMF). This co-culture model, based on an isogenic panel of cell lines, can yield insights to understand breast cancer progression. However, 3D cultures pose challenges for quantitative assessment and imaging, especially when the goal is to measure the same organoid structures over time. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a non-invasive method to longitudinally quantify morphological changes, we found that OCT provides excellent visualization of MEC-fibroblast co-cultures as they form ductal acini and remodel over time. Different concentrations of fibroblasts and MEC reflecting reported physiological ratios [1] were evaluated, and we found that larger, hollower, and more aspherical acini were formed only by pre-malignant MEC (MCF10DCIS.com) in the presence of fibroblasts, whereas in comparable conditions, normal MEC (MCF10A) acini remained smaller and less aspherical. The ratio of fibroblast to MEC was also influential in determining organoid phenotypes, with higher concentrations of fibroblasts producing more aspherical structures in MCF10DCIS.com. These findings suggest that stromal-epithelial interactions between fibroblasts and MEC can be modeled in vitro, with OCT imaging as a convenient means of assaying time dependent changes, with the potential for yielding important biological insights about the differences between benign and pre-malignant cells.	
30956133        	Transfer of Functional Cargo in Exomeres.            	Exomeres are a recently discovered type of extracellular nanoparticle with no known biological function. Herein, we describe a simple ultracentrifugation-based method for separation of exomeres from exosomes. Exomeres are enriched in Argonaute 1-3 and amyloid precursor protein. We identify distinct functions of exomeres mediated by two of their cargo, the β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal-I) that α2,6- sialylates N-glycans, and the EGFR ligand, amphiregulin (AREG). Functional ST6Gal-I in exomeres can be transferred to cells, resulting in hypersialylation of recipient cell-surface proteins including β1-integrin. AREG-containing exomeres elicit prolonged EGFR and downstream signaling in recipient cells, modulate EGFR trafficking in normal intestinal organoids, and dramatically enhance the growth of colonic tumor organoids. This study provides a simplified method of exomere isolation and demonstrates that exomeres contain and can transfer functional cargo. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of nanoparticles and should accelerate advances in determining the composition and biological functions of exomeres.

30154130        	Atypical carcinoid of the uterine cervix accompanying adenocarcinoma in situ.            	A 45-year-old woman presented with painless vaginal bleeding for 2 months. A biopsy was taken from the uterine cervix, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was suspected. After three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment, the patient underwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy.Review the high quality, interactive digital Aperio slide at http://virtualacp.com/JCPCases/jclinpath-2018-205081-1/ and consider your diagnosis. WHAT IS YOUR DIAGNOSIS?: Typical carcinoid.Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.Atypical carcinoid.Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.Sex cord-stromal tumours of the uterine cervix.-The correct answer is after the discussion.                Neuroendocrine tumours of the uterine cervix are a rare cancer of the female reproductive system, accounting for approximately 1% of all female cervical malignancies.1 2 In 1997, a consensus workshop suggested four types of neuroendocrine tumours of the uterine cervix: typical and atypical carcinoid tumours, small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and large cell carcinomas.1 Among all the categories, small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are of the highest incidence. A PubMed search revealed that only 15 cases of atypical carcinoid tumours of the uterine cervix have been reported.3 4 Because of infrequency, the clinical and pathological features of atypical carcinoid tumours of the uterine cervix remain unknown.Atypical carcinoids are characterised by great cytological atypia, which means abundant or scanty cytoplasm and visible nucleoli with granular chromatin. Tumour cells lined up in insular, trabecular, columnar and nested organoid patterns; they are epithelioid in appearance, but can be spindled (figure 1A). Necrosis could be observed in some areas and mitotic activity is up to 10 mitotic figures/10 high-power field (figure 1B). On immunohistochemistry, atypical carcinoids are diffuse and positive for Syn, CgA and CD56 (figure 2). An electron microscopic test was done, and several neuroendocrine granules were distributed in the tumour cell plasma (figure 3).jclinpath;71/11/1030/F1F1F1Figure 1(A) Insular, trabecular and columnar patterns of tumour cells were focally observed in the deep stroma of the cervix (H&E ×200). (B) Tumour cells showed small-sized, scanty cytoplasm, enlarged and deeply stained nuclei with condensed chromatin, obvious atypia, and increased mitotic activity (H&E ×400).

27930322        	Casitas B-cell lymphoma (Cbl) proteins protect mammary epithelial cells from proteotoxicity of active c-Src accumulation.            	Casitas B-cell lymphoma (Cbl) family ubiquitin ligases negatively regulate tyrosine kinase-dependent signal transduction by promoting degradation of active kinases. We and others previously reported that loss of Cbl functions caused hyperproliferation in lymphoid and hematopoietic systems. Unexpectedly, Cbl deletion in Cbl-b-null, Cbl-c-null primary mouse mammary epithelial cells (MECs) (Cbl triple-deficiency) induced rapid cell death despite enhanced MAP kinase and AKT activation. Acute Cbl triple-deficiency elicited distinct transcriptional and biochemical responses with partial overlap with previously described cellular reactions to unfolded proteins and oxidative stress. Although the levels of reactive oxygen species were comparable, detergent-insoluble protein aggregates containing phosphorylated c-Src accumulated in Cbl triple-deficient MECs. Treatment with a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor dasatinib blocked protein aggregate accumulation and restored in vitro organoid formation. This effect is most likely mediated through c-Src because Cbl triple-deficient MECs were able to form organoids upon shRNA-mediated c-Src knockdown. Taking these data together, the present study demonstrates that Cbl family proteins are required to protect MECs from proteotoxic stress-induced cell death by promoting turnover of active c-Src.	
20332242        	Vascular endothelial growth factor secreted by activated stroma enhances angiogenesis and hormone-independent growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.            	"Reactive" or activated stroma characterizes many malignancies including breast cancers. Recently, we isolated a reactive mouse mammary gland stromal cell line called BJ3Z. These cells express alpha-smooth muscle actin and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and are tumorigenic when injected into mice. Here we show that, in vivo, BJ3Z cells influence the angiogenesis and proliferation of xenografted estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell-derived solid tumors. The growth-promoting effects of BJ3Z cells are equivalent to those of estradiol (E(2)). BJ3Z cells also increase the proliferation of normal mouse mammary luminal cells adjacent to tumors. In vitro, BJ3Z cells reorganize and increase the proliferation of cocultured malignant MCF-7 and normal human breast MCF10A cells grown as organoids in three-dimensional culture. The effects of BJ3Z cells on MCF-7 cells are equivalent to those of E(2). In contrast, BJ3Z cells do not alter the growth of highly aggressive ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. We show that BJ3Z cells secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The growth of MCF-7 organoids induced by BJ3Z can be inhibited by antagonists of VEGF and SDF-1. Conversely, recombinant VEGF stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7, but not MDA-MB-231, organoids. We conclude that, in addition to angiogenesis, VEGF released by activated stroma increases the growth of ER-positive malignant epithelial cells and of adjacent normal epithelium. Because activated stroma can substitute for E(2) and fosters hormone-independent growth of ER-positive tumors, we suggest that breast cancers exhibiting intrinsic hormone resistance may respond to antiangiogenic therapies.	
25648995        	HDAC1 and HDAC2 collectively regulate intestinal stem cell homeostasis.            	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are posttranslational modifiers that deacetylate proteins. Despite their crucial role in numerous biological processes, the use of broad-range HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), has shown clinical efficacy. However, undesired side effects highlight the necessity to better understand the biology of different HDACs and target the relevant HDACs. Using a novel mouse model, in which HDAC1 and HDAC2 can be simultaneously deleted in the intestine of adult mice, we show that the simultaneous deletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 leads to a rapid loss of intestinal homeostasis. Importantly, this deletion cannot be sustained, and 8 days after initial ablation, stem cells that have escaped HDAC1 or HDAC2 deletion swiftly repopulate the intestinal lining. In vitro ablation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 using intestinal organoid cultures resulted in a down-regulation of multiple intestinal stem cell markers and functional loss of clonogenic capacity. Importantly, treatment of wild-type organoids with class I-specific HDACi MS-275 also induced a similar loss of stemness, providing a possible rationale for the gastrointestinal side effects often observed in HDACi-treated patients. In conclusion, these data show that HDAC1 and HDAC2 have a redundant function and are essential to maintain intestinal homeostasis.                © FASEB.	
33497866        	Sox9EGFP Defines Biliary Epithelial Heterogeneity Downstream of Yap Activity.            	Defining the genetic heterogeneity of intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (BECs) is challenging, and tools for identifying BEC subpopulations are limited. Here, we characterize the expression of a Sox9EGFP transgene in the liver and demonstrate that green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression levels are associated with distinct cell types.                Sox9EGFP BAC transgenic mice were assayed by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and gene expression profiling to characterize in vivo characteristics of GFP populations. Single BECs from distinct GFP populations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and functional analysis was conducted in organoid forming assays. Intrahepatic ductal epithelium was grown as organoids and treated with a Yes-associated protein (Yap) inhibitor or bile acids to determine upstream regulation of Sox9 in BECs. Sox9EGFP mice were subjected to bile duct ligation, and GFP expression was assessed by immunofluorescence.                BECs express low or high levels of GFP, whereas periportal hepatocytes express sublow GFP. Sox9EGFP+ BECs are differentially distributed by duct size and demonstrate distinct gene expression signatures, with enrichment of Cyr61 and Hes1 in GFPhigh BECs. Single Sox9EGFP+ cells form organoids that exhibit heterogeneous survival, growth, and HNF4A activation dependent on culture conditions, suggesting that exogenous signaling impacts BEC heterogeneity. Yap is required to maintain Sox9 expression in biliary organoids, but bile acids are insufficient to induce BEC Yap activity or Sox9 in vivo and in vitro. Sox9EGFP remains restricted to BECs and periportal hepatocytes after bile duct ligation.                Our data demonstrate that Sox9EGFP levels provide readout of Yap activity and delineate BEC heterogeneity, providing a tool for assaying subpopulation-specific cellular function in the liver.

30158952        	Emergence of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: How High-Throughput Technologies Expedite the Solutions for a Rare Cancer Type.            	Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the cancer of the intrahepatic bile ducts, and together with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), constitute the majority of primary liver cancers. ICC is a rare disorder as its overall incidence is < 1/100,000 in the United States and Europe. However, it shows much higher incidence in particular geographical regions, such as northeastern Thailand, where liver fluke infection is the most common risk factor of ICC. Since the early stages of ICC are often asymptomatic, the patients are usually diagnosed at advanced stages with no effective treatments available, leading to the high mortality rate. In addition, unclear genetic mechanisms, heterogeneous nature, and various etiologies complicate the development of new efficient treatments. Recently, a number of studies have employed high-throughput approaches, including next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry, in order to understand ICC in different biological aspects. In general, the majority of recurrent genetic alterations identified in ICC are enriched in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, such as mutations in TP53, KRAS, BAP1, ARID1A, IDH1, IDH2, and novel FGFR2 fusion genes. Yet, there are no major driver genes with immediate clinical solutions characterized. Interestingly, recent studies utilized multi-omics data to classify ICC into two main subgroups, one with immune response genes as the main driving factor, while another is enriched with driver mutations in the genes associated with epigenetic regulations, such as IDH1 and IDH2. The two subgroups also show different hypermethylation patterns in the promoter regions. Additionally, the immune response induced by host-pathogen interactions, i.e., liver fluke infection, may further stimulate tumor growth through alterations of the tumor microenvironment. For in-depth functional studies, although many ICC cell lines have been globally established, these homogeneous cell lines may not fully explain the highly heterogeneous genetic contents of this disorder. Therefore, the advent of patient-derived xenograft and 3D patient-derived organoids as new disease models together with the understanding of evolution and genetic alterations of tumor cells at the single-cell resolution will likely become the main focus to fill the current translational research gaps of ICC in the future.	
28938237        	Fertility restoration with spermatogonial stem cells.            	This review evaluates the state of the art in terms of challenges and strategies used to restore fertility with spermatogonial stem cells retrieved from prepubertal boys affected by cancer. Although these boys do not yet produce spermatozoa, the only option to preserve their fertility is cryopreservation of spermatogonial stem cells in the form of testicular cell suspensions or whole tissue pieces. Different techniques have been described to achieve completion of spermatogenesis from human, spermatogonial stem cells but none is yet ready for clinical application. A crucial point to address is gaining a full understanding of spermatogonial stem cell niche pathophysiology, where germ cells undergo proliferation and differentiation. Various fertility restoration approaches will be presented depending on the presence of an intact niche, dissociated niche, or reconstituted niche.                Testicular organoids open the way to providing further insights into the niche. They can recreate the three-dimensional architecture of the testicular microenvironment in vitro, allowing a large number of applications, from physiology to drug toxicity investigations.                In addition to the full elucidation of the niche microenvironment, achieving fertility restoration from cryopreserved human spermatogonial stem cells implies overcoming other important challenges. Testicular organoids might prove to be essential tools to progress in this field.	
28232156        	Molecular and cytogenomic profiling of hepatic adenocarcinoma expressing inhibinA, a mimicker of neuroendocrine tumors: proposal to reclassify as "cholangioblastic variant of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma".            	Only a single case report exists in the literature of hepatic adenocarcinoma expressing InhibinA in a young woman, in which the authors proposed it to be a rare variant of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). We present novel molecular and histologic findings in our series of three cases occurring in young women and show these tumors may mimic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Immunohistochemical (IHC) profiling was performed along with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) 47-gene solid tumor panel, and cytogenomic profiling via single-nucleotide polypmorphism microarray. IHC for inhibinA, chromogranin A (ChrA), and synaptophysin (Syn) was surveyed in liver tumors and in fetal liver. Two of the three patients recurred with metastatic disease with two confirmed deaths. Histological patterns present in the tumors included solid, trabecular, organoid, microcystic, and blastemal-like. IHC was positive for cytokeratin 7 in 3/3, cytokeratin 19 in 3/3, inhibinA in 3/3, ChrA in 3/3, Syn in 3/3, Sox9 in 2/3 and HepPar1 in 0/3. NGS was negative for pathogenic mutations. Recurrent cytogenomic abnormalities included gain of 17q, and loss of 6q. InhibinA was strong and diffusely expressed in 0/10 (0%) iCCA, 0/15 (0%) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), in the biliary component of 1/4 (25%) combined HCC-iCCA, 0/4 hepatoblastomas, 1/8 (13%) metastatic NET, and in 1/8 fetal liver tissues. We propose a classification of "cholangioblastic variant of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma" and molecular pathogenesis for this rare malignancy. Accurate identification on core biopsy is crucial for clinical management as it may mimic neuroendocrine neoplasms.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
30696658        	Nod1 Imprints Inflammatory and Carcinogenic Responses toward the Gastric Pathogen Helicobacter pylori.            	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the strongest known risk for gastric cancer. The H. pylori cag type IV secretion system is an oncogenic locus that translocates peptidoglycan into host cells, where it is recognized by NOD1, an innate immune receptor. Beyond this, the role of NOD1 in H. pylori-induced cancer remains undefined. To address this knowledge gap, we infected two genetic models of Nod1 deficiency with the H. pylori cag+ strain PMSS1: C57BL/6 mice, which rarely develop cancer, and INS-GAS FVB/N mice, which commonly develop cancer. Infected C57BL/6                         Nod1-/-                     and INS-GAS                         Nod1-/-                     mice acutely developed more severe gastritis, and INS-GAS                         Nod1-/-                     mice developed gastric dysplasia more frequently compared with Nod1+/+ mice. Because Nod1 genotype status did not alter microbial phenotypes of in vivo-adapted H. pylori, we investigated host immunologic responses. H. pylori infection of Nod1-/- mice led to significantly increased gastric mucosal levels of Th1, Th17, and Th2 cytokines compared with Nod1 wild-type (WT) mice. To define the role of specific innate immune cells, we quantified cytokine secretion from H. pylori-infected primary gastric organoids generated from WT or Nod1-/- mice that were cocultured with or without WT or Nod1-/- macrophages. Infection increased cytokine production from gastric epithelial cells and macrophages and elevations were significantly increased with Nod1 deficiency. Furthermore, H. pylori infection altered the polarization status of Nod1-/- macrophages compared with Nod1+/+ macrophages. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that loss of Nod1 augments inflammatory and injury responses to H. pylori. Nod1 may exert its restrictive role by altering macrophage polarization, leading to immune evasion and microbial persistence. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that manipulation of NOD1 may represent a novel strategy to prevent or treat pathologic outcomes induced by H. pylori infection.                ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.	
28661474        	Mutant p53 dictates the oncogenic activity of c-Abl in triple-negative breast cancers.            	We recently established c-Abl as a potent suppressor of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression through its reactivation of a p53:p21 signaling axis coupled to senescence. Moreover, we observed co-expression of p53 and c-Abl to be essential for normal mammary epithelial cell physiology, as this relationship is lost upon breast cancer progression. Cytoplasmic c-Abl activity is markedly increased in some TNBCs and contributes to disease progression; however, the mechanisms underlying these events remain largely unknown. In addressing this question, we show here that c-Abl is predominantly restricted to the cytoplasm of human MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells, and to the nucleus of human MCF-7 luminal A cells. TTK is a mitotic protein kinase that phosphorylates c-Abl on Thr735, thereby creating a recognition binding motif for 14-3-3 adaptor proteins in response to oxidative stress. By interrogating the METABRIC database, we observed a significant correlation between p53 expression and that of c-Abl and TTK in basal-like breast cancers. Moreover, heterologous expression of TTK in MCF-7 cells significantly stimulated their growth in part via a c-Abl-dependent mechanism. Conversely, depleting TTK expression in MDA-MB-231 cells not only inhibited their organoid growth in 3D-cultures, but also sensitized them to the tumor suppressing activities of c-Abl independent of its subcellular localization. Moreover, we show that mutant p53 forms cytoplasmic complexes with c-Abl, thereby dictating the subcellular localization of c-Abl and the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to Imatinib. In response to nutrient deprivation, c-Abl:p53 complexes readily accumulate in the nucleus, resulting in the hyperactivation of c-Abl and initiation of its anti-tumor activities. Collectively, we identified a novel mutant p53:c-Abl cytoplasmic signaling complex that promotes MDA-MB-231 cell growth and highlights the contextual cues that confer oncogenic activity to c-Abl in breast cancer.	
32047562        	Progress in Animal Models of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.            	As a common gastrointestinal tumor, the incidence of pancreatic cancer has been increasing in recent years. The disease shows multi-gene, multi-step complex evolution from occurrence to dissemination. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer has an insidious onset and an extremely poor prognosis, so it is difficult to obtain cinical specimens at different stages of the disease, and it is, therefore, difficult to observe tumorigenesis and tumor development in patients with pancreatic cancer. At present, no standard protocols stipulate clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer, and the benefit rate of new targeted therapies is low. For this reason, a well-established preclinical model of pancreatic cancer must be established to allow further exploration of the occurrence, development, invasion, and metastasis mechanism of pancreatic cancer, as well as to facilitate research into new therapeutic targets. A large number of animal models of pancreatic cancer are currently available, including a cancer cell line-based xenograft, a patient-derived xenograft, several mouse models (including transgenic mice), and organoid models. These models have their own characteristics, but they still cannot perfectly predict the clinical outcome of the new treatment. In this paper, we present the distinctive features of the currently popular pancreatic cancer models, and discuss their preparation methods, clinical relations, scientific purposes and limitations.                © The author(s).	
30804505        	Apical-basal polarity inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumour metastasis by PAR-complex-mediated SNAI1 degradation.            	Loss of apical-basal polarity and activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) both contribute to carcinoma progression and metastasis. Here, we report that apical-basal polarity inhibits EMT to suppress metastatic dissemination. Using mouse and human epithelial three-dimensional organoid cultures, we show that the PAR-atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) polarity complex inhibits EMT and invasion by promoting degradation of the SNAIL family protein SNAI1. Under intact apical-basal polarity, aPKC kinases phosphorylate S249 of SNAI1, which leads to protein degradation. Loss of apical-basal polarity prevents aPKC-mediated SNAI1 phosphorylation and stabilizes the SNAI1 protein to promote EMT and invasion. In human breast tumour xenografts, inhibition of the PAR-complex-mediated SNAI1 degradation mechanism promotes tumour invasion and metastasis. Analyses of human breast tissue samples reveal negative correlations between PAR3 and SNAI1 protein levels. Our results demonstrate that apical-basal polarity functions as a critical checkpoint of EMT to precisely control epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during tumour metastasis.	
28802143        	Extrinsic control of Wnt signaling in the intestine.            	The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a central regulator of development and tissue homeostasis. In the intestine, Wnt signaling is primarily known as the principal organizer of epithelial stem cell identity and proliferation. Within the last decade, numerous scientific breakthroughs have shed light on epithelial self-organization in the gut, and organoids are now routinely used to study stem cell biology and intestinal pathophysiology. The contribution of non-epithelial cells to Wnt signaling in the gut has received less attention. However, there is mounting evidence that stromal cells are a rich source of Wnt pathway activators and inhibitors, which can dynamically shape Wnt signaling to control epithelial proliferation and restitution. Elucidating the extent and mechanisms of paracrine Wnt signaling in the intestine has the potential to broaden our understanding of epithelial homeostasis, and may be of particular relevance for disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases and colitis-associated cancers.

26032419        	Prostate Sphere-forming Stem Cells Are Derived from the P63-expressing Basal Compartment.            	Prostate stem cells (P-SCs) are capable of giving rise to all three lineages of prostate epithelial cells, including basal, luminal, and neuroendocrine cells. Multiple methods have been used to identify P-SCs in adult prostates. These include in vivo renal capsule implantation of a single epithelial cell with urogenital mesenchymal cells, in vitro prostasphere and organoid cultures, and lineage tracing with castration-resistant Nkx3.1 expression (CARN), in conjunction with expression of cell type-specific markers. Both organoid culture and CARN tracing show the existence of P-SCs in the luminal compartment. Although prostasphere cells predominantly express basal cell-specific cytokeratin and P63, the lineage of prostasphere-forming cells in the P-SC hierarchy remains to be determined. Using lineage tracing with P63(CreERT2), we show here that the sphere-forming P-SCs are P63-expressing cells and reside in the basal compartment. Therefore we designate them as basal P-SCs (P-bSCs). P-bSCs are capable of differentiating into AR(+) and CK18(+) organoid cells, but organoid cells cannot form spheres. We also report that prostaspheres contain quiescent stem cells. Therefore, the results show that P-bSCs represent stem cells that are early in the hierarchy of overall prostate tissue stem cells. Understanding the contribution of the two types of P-SCs to prostate development and prostate cancer stem cells and how to manipulate them may open new avenues for control of prostate cancer progression and relapse.                 © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.	
28283650        	Culturing human intestinal stem cells for regenerative applications in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.            	Both the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing globally; in the industrialized world up to 0.5% of the population are affected and around 4.2 million individuals suffer from IBD in Europe and North America combined. Successful engraftment in experimental colitis models suggests that intestinal stem cell transplantation could constitute a novel treatment strategy to re-establish mucosal barrier function in patients with severe disease. Intestinal stem cells can be grown in vitro in organoid structures, though only a fraction of the cells contained are stem cells with regenerative capabilities. Hence, techniques to enrich stem cell populations are being pursued through the development of multiple two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture protocols, as well as co-culture techniques and multiple growth medium compositions. Moreover, research in support matrices allowing for efficient clinical application is in progress. In vitro culture is accomplished by modulating the signaling pathways fundamental for the stem cell niche with a suitable culture matrix to provide additional contact-dependent stimuli and structural support. The aim of this review was to discuss medium compositions and support matrices for optimal intestinal stem cell culture, as well as potential modifications to advance clinical use in IBD.                © 2017 The Authors.

23212921        	Chemical genetic screen reveals a role for desmosomal adhesion in mammary branching morphogenesis.            	During the process of branching morphogenesis, the mammary gland undergoes distinct phases of remodeling to form an elaborate ductal network that ultimately produces and delivers milk to newborn animals. These developmental events rely on tight regulation of critical cellular pathways, many of which are probably disrupted during initiation and progression of breast cancer. Transgenic mouse and in vitro organoid models previously identified growth factor signaling as a key regulator of mammary branching, but the functional downstream targets of these pathways remain unclear. Here, we used purified primary mammary epithelial cells stimulated with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) to model mammary branching morphogenesis in vitro. We employed a forward chemical genetic approach to identify modulators of this process and describe a potent compound, 1023, that blocks FGF2-induced branching. In primary mammary epithelial cells, we used lentivirus-mediated knockdown of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to demonstrate that 1023 acts through AHR to block branching. Using 1023 as a tool, we identified desmosomal adhesion as a novel target of AHR signaling and show that desmosomes are critical for AHR agonists to block branching. Our findings support a functional role for desmosomes during mammary morphogenesis and also in blocking FGF-induced invasion.	
31574953        	Patient-Derived Glioma Models: From Patients to Dish to Animals.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor in adults associated with a poor survival. Current standard of care consists of surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy. GBMs are highly heterogeneous, having a complex interaction among different cells within the tumor as well as the tumor microenvironment. One of the main challenges in the neuro-oncology field in general, and GBM in particular, is to find an optimum culture condition that maintains the molecular genotype and phenotype as well as heterogeneity of the original tumor in vitro and in vivo. Established cell lines were shown to be a poor model of the disease, failing to recapitulate the phenotype and harboring non-parental genotypic mutations. Given the growing understanding of GBM biology, the discovery of glioma cancer stem-like cells (GSCs), and their role in tumor formation and therapeutic resistance, scientists are turning more towards patient-derived cells and xenografts as a more representative model. In this review, we will discuss the current state of patient-derived GSCs and their xenografts; and provide an overview of different established models to study GBM biology and to identify novel therapeutics in the pre-clinical phase.	
33288882        	Selective inhibition of stemness through EGFR/FOXA2/SOX9 axis reduces pancreatic cancer metastasis.            	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is difficult to defeat due to mechanism (s) driving metastasis and drug resistance. Cancer stemness is a major challenging phenomenon associated with PC metastasis and limiting therapy efficacy. In this study, we evaluated the pre-clinical and clinical significance of eradicating pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSC) and its components using a pan-EGFR inhibitor afatinib in combination with gemcitabine. Afatinib in combination with gemcitabine significantly reduced KrasG12D/+; Pdx-1 Cre (KC) (P < 0.01) and KrasG12D/+; p53R172H/+; Pdx-1 Cre (KPC) (P < 0.05) derived mouse tumoroids and KPC-derived murine syngeneic cell line growth compared to gemcitabine/afatinib alone treatment. The drug combination also reduced PC xenograft tumor burden (P < 0.05) and the incidence of metastasis by affecting key stemness markers, as confirmed by co-localization studies. Moreover, the drug combination significantly decreases the growth of various PC patient-derived organoids (P < 0.001). We found that SOX9 is significantly overexpressed in high-grade PC tumors (P < 0.05) and in chemotherapy-treated patients compared to chemo-naïve patients (P < 0.05). These results were further validated using publicly available datasets. Moreover, afatinib alone or in combination with gemcitabine decreased stemness and tumorspheres by reducing phosphorylation of EGFR family proteins, ERK, FAK, and CSC markers. Mechanistically, afatinib treatment decreased CSC markers by downregulating SOX9 via FOXA2. Indeed, EGFR and FOXA2 depletion reduced SOX9 expression in PCSCs. Taken together, pan-EGFR inhibition by afatinib impedes PCSCs growth and metastasis via the EGFR/ERK/FOXA2/SOX9 axis. This novel mechanism of pan-EGFR inhibitor and its ability to eradicate CSC may serve as a tailor-made approach to enhance chemotherapeutic benefits in other cancer types.	
28363996        	miR-34a and miR-34b/c Suppress Intestinal Tumorigenesis.            	The p53-inducible miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes are frequently silenced in colorectal cancer. To address the in vivo relevance of miR-34a/b/c function for suppression of intestinal tumor formation, we generated ApcMin/+ mice with deletions of the miR-34a and/or miR-34b/c genes separately or in combination. Combined deletion of miR-34a/b/c increased the number of intestinal stem cells as well as Paneth and Goblet cells, resulting in enlarged intestinal crypts. miR-34a/b/c-deficient ApcMin/+ mice displayed an increased tumor burden and grade and decreased survival. miR-34a/b/c-deficient adenomas showed elevated proliferation and decreased apoptosis and displayed pronounced bacterial infiltration, which may be due to an observed decrease in infiltrating immune cells and downregulation of barrier proteins. mRNA induction in miR-34a/b/c-deficient tumors was enriched for miR-34a/b/c seed-matching sites and for mRNAs encoding proteins related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stemness, and Wnt signaling. Accordingly, cells explanted from miR-34a/b/c-deficient adenomas formed tumor organoids at an increased rate. Several upregulated miR-34 targets displayed elevated expression in primary human colorectal cancers that was associated with lymph-node metastases (INHBB, AXL, FGFR1, and PDFGRB) and upregulation of INHBB and AXL in primary colorectal cancer was associated with poor patient survival. In conclusion, our results show that miR-34a/b/c suppress tumor formation caused by loss of Apc and control intestinal stem cell and secretory cell homeostasis by downregulation of multiple target mRNAs.

26036343        	PAK1 modulates a PPARγ/NF-κB cascade in intestinal inflammation.            	P21-activated kinases (PAKs) are multifunctional effectors of Rho GTPases with both kinase and scaffolding activity. Here, we investigated the effects of inflammation on PAK1 signaling and its role in colitis-driven carcinogenesis. PAK1 and p-PAK1 (Thr423) were assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. C57BL6/J wildtype mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal TNFα injection. Small intestinal organoids from these mice and from PAK1-KO mice were cultured with TNFα. NF-κB and PPARγ were analyzed upon PAK1 overexpression and silencing for transcriptional/translational regulation. PAK1 expression and activation was increased on the luminal intestinal epithelial surface in inflammatory bowel disease and colitis-associated cancer. PAK1 was phosphorylated upon treatment with IFNγ, IL-1β, and TNFα. In vivo, mice administered with TNFα showed increased p-PAK1 in intestinal villi, which was associated with nuclear p65 and NF-κB activation. p65 nuclear translocation downstream of TNFα was strongly inhibited in PAK1-KO small intestinal organoids. PAK1 overexpression induced a PAK1-p65 interaction as visualized by co-immunoprecipitation, nuclear translocation, and increased NF-κB transactivation, all of which were impeded by kinase-dead PAK1. Moreover, PAK1 overexpression downregulated PPARγ and mesalamine recovered PPARγ through PAK1 inhibition. On the other hand PAK1 silencing inhibited NF-κB, which was recovered using BADGE, a PPARγ antagonist. Altogether these data demonstrate that PAK1 overexpression and activation in inflammation and colitis-associated cancer promote NF-κB activity via suppression of PPARγ in intestinal epithelial cells.

26996663        	Collagen-rich stroma in aggressive colon tumors induces mesenchymal gene expression and tumor cell invasion.            	Gene expression-based classification systems have identified an aggressive colon cancer subtype with mesenchymal features, possibly reflecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells. However, stromal fibroblasts contribute extensively to the mesenchymal phenotype of aggressive colon tumors, challenging the notion of tumor EMT. To separately study the neoplastic and stromal compartments of colon tumors, we have generated a stroma gene filter (SGF). Comparative analysis of stromahigh and stromalow tumors shows that the neoplastic cells in stromahigh tumors express specific EMT drivers (ZEB2, TWIST1, TWIST2) and that 98% of differentially expressed genes are strongly correlated with them. Analysis of differential gene expression between mesenchymal and epithelial cancer cell lines revealed that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), a transcriptional activator of intestinal (epithelial) differentiation, and its target genes are highly expressed in epithelial cancer cell lines. However, mesenchymal-type cancer cell lines expressed only part of the mesenchymal genes expressed by tumor-derived neoplastic cells, suggesting that external cues were lacking. We found that collagen-I dominates the extracellular matrix in aggressive colon cancer. Mimicking the tumor microenvironment by replacing laminin-rich Matrigel with collagen-I was sufficient to induce tumor-specific mesenchymal gene expression, suppression of HNF4α and its target genes, and collective tumor cell invasion of patient-derived colon tumor organoids. The data connect collagen-rich stroma to mesenchymal gene expression in neoplastic cells and to collective tumor cell invasion. Targeting the tumor-collagen interface may therefore be explored as a novel strategy in the treatment of aggressive colon cancer.	
27296616        	Engineering a perfusable 3D human liver platform from iPS cells.            	In vitro models of human tissue are crucial to our ability to study human disease as well as develop safe and effective drug therapies. Models of single organs in static and microfluidic culture have been established and shown utility for modeling some aspects of health and disease; however, these systems lack multi-organ interactions that are critical to some aspects of drug metabolism and toxicity. Thus, as part of a consortium of researchers, we have developed a liver chip that meets the following criteria: (1) employs human iPS cells from a patient of interest, (2) cultures cells in perfusable 3D organoids, and (3) is robust to variations in perfusion rate so as to be compatible in series with other specialized tissue chips (e.g. heart, lung). In order to achieve this, we describe methods to form hepatocyte aggregates from primary and iPS-derived cells, alone and in co-culture with support cells. This necessitated a novel culture protocol for the interrupted differentiation of iPS cells that permits their removal from a plated surface and aggregation while maintaining phenotypic hepatic functions. In order to incorporate these 3D aggregates in a perfusable platform, we next encapsulated the cells in a PEG hydrogel to prevent aggregation and overgrowth once on chip. We adapted a C-trap chip architecture from the literature that enabled robust loading with encapsulated organoids and culture over a range of flow rates. Finally, we characterize the liver functions of this iHep organoid chip under perfusion and demonstrate a lifetime of at least 28 days. We envision that such this strategy can be generalized to other microfluidic tissue models and provides an opportunity to query patient-specific liver responses in vitro.	
32690957        	Organotypic culture assays for murine and human primary and metastatic-site tumors.            	Cancer invasion and metastasis are challenging to study in vivo since they occur deep inside the body over extended time periods. Organotypic 3D culture of fresh tumor tissue enables convenient real-time imaging, genetic and microenvironmental manipulation and molecular analysis. Here, we provide detailed protocols to isolate and culture heterogenous organoids from murine and human primary and metastatic site tumors. The time required to isolate organoids can vary based on the tissue and organ type but typically takes <7 h. We describe a suite of assays that model specific aspects of metastasis, including proliferation, survival, invasion, dissemination and colony formation. We also specify comprehensive protocols for downstream applications of organotypic cultures that will allow users to (i) test the role of specific genes in regulating various cellular processes, (ii) distinguish the contributions of several microenvironmental factors and (iii) test the effects of novel therapeutics.	
31361973        	Imbalance of autophagy and apoptosis in intestinal epithelium lacking the vitamin D receptor.            	Apoptosis and autophagy are dynamic processes that determine the fate of cells. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) deficiency in the intestine leads to abnormal Paneth cells and impaired autophagy function. Here, we will elucidate the mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial VDR regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. We used in vivo VDRlox and VDR∆IEC mice and ex vivo organoids generated from small intestine and colon tissues. We found that VDR deficiency induced more apoptotic cells and significantly increased cell death in the small intestine and colon of VDR∆IEC mice. The proapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) associated X protein (Bax) was enhanced, whereas autophagy related 16 like 1 (ATG16L1) and Beclin-1 were decreased in the intestines of VDRΔIEC mice. Apoptosis induced by Bax reduced autophagy by decreasing Beclin-1. Physical interactions between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 were increased in the VDR-deficient epithelia from mice. The growth of VDR∆IEC organoids was significantly slower with fewer Paneth cells than that of VDR+/+ organoids. The expression levels of Beclin-1 and lysozyme were decreased in VDR∆IEC organoids. Bacterial endotoxin levels were high in the serum from VDR∆IEC mice and made mice susceptible to colitis. In the organoids and colitis IL-10-/- mice, vitamin D3 treatment increased VDR and ATG16L1 protein expression levels, which activated autophagic responses. In summary, intestinal epithelial VDR regulates autophagy and apoptosis through ATG16L1 and Beclin-1. Our studies provide fundamental insights into the tissue-specific function of VDR in modulating the balance between autophagy and apoptosis.-Lu, R., Zhang, Y.-G., Xia, Y., Sun, J.

22644112        	Isolation of mouse mammary epithelial subpopulations: a comparison of leading methods.            	Isolation of mammary epithelial subpopulations, including stem and progenitor cells, has become a standard technique in recent years. However, a number of methods and approaches for this have developed and the relative benefits of the different approaches, and the reason for their development, have not always been clear. Here, three of the leading laboratories working on the separation of mammary cell subpopulations have summarised their methods, highlighted their differences and similarities and also discussed the reasoning behind the approaches they have taken. This article will assist workers establishing mammary cell separation protocols in their laboratories to make informed choices about the methods they should use.	
33470182        	Stromal DLK1 promotes proliferation and inhibits differentiation of the intestinal epithelium during development.            	The stem/progenitor cells of the developing intestine arebiologically distinct from their adult counterparts. Here we examine the microenvironmental cues that regulate the embryonic stem/progenitor population, focusing on the role of Notch pathway factor, Delta-Like Protein 1 (DLK1).                mRNAseq analyses of intestinal mesenchymal cells (IMC) collected from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) or adult IMCs and a novel co-culture system with E14.5 intestinal epithelial organoids were used. Following addition of recombinant DLK1 (rDLK) or Dlk1 siRNA (siDlk1), epithelial characteristics were compared using imaging, replating efficiency assays, qPCR and immunocytochemistry. The intestinal phenotype of littermate Dlk1 +/+ and Dlk1 -/- mice was compared using immunohistochemistry.                Using transcriptomic analyses we identified morphogens derived from the embryonic mesenchyme that potentially regulate the developing epithelial cells, to focus on Notch family candidate, DLK1. Immunohistochemistry indicated that DLK1 was expressed exclusively in the intestinal stroma at E14.5 at the top of emerging villi, decreased after birth and shifted to the intestinal epithelium in adulthood. In co-culture experiments, addition of rDLK1 to adult IMCs inhibited organoid differentiation, whereas Dlk1 knock-down in embryonic IMCs increased epithelial differentiation to secretory lineage cells. Dlk1 -/- mice had restricted Ki67+ cells in the villi base and increased secretory lineage cells compared with Dlk1 +/+ embryos.                Mesenchyme-derived DLK1 plays an important role in the promotion of epithelial stem/precursor expansion and prevention of differentiation to secretory lineages in the developing intestine.	
33554135        	Mouse model of colorectal cancer: orthotopic co-implantation of tumor and stroma cells in cecum and rectum.            	In vivo interrogation of the functional role of genes implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) is limited by the need for physiological models that mimic the disease. Here, we describe a protocol that provides the steps required for the orthotopic co-implantation of tumoral and stromal cells into the cecum and rectum to investigate the crosstalk between the tumor and its microenvironment. This protocol recapitulates metastases to the lymph nodes, liver, and lungs observed in human CRC. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Kasashima et al.

32005909        	Generation and characterization of a cell line from an intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas.            	Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) is a distinct precancerous lesion in the pancreas with unique clinical and molecular features. Although in vitro studies in two-dimensional culture have led to numerous important insights in pancreatic cancer, such models are currently lacking for precancerous lesions. In this study, we report the generation and characterization of a cell line from a human pancreatic ITPN. Neoplastic cells were initially cultured in a three-dimensional organoid system, followed by transfer to two-dimensional culture. RNA sequencing revealed a gene expression profile consistent with pancreatic ductal origin, and whole genome sequencing identified many somatic mutations (including in genes involved in DNA repair and Wnt signaling) and structural rearrangements. In vitro characterization of the tumorigenic potential demonstrated a phenotype between that of normal pancreatic ductal cells and cancer cell lines. This cell line represents a valuable resource for interrogation of unique ITPN biology, as well as precancerous pancreatic lesions more generally.	
28415765        	Stable aneuploid tumors cells are more sensitive to TTK inhibition than chromosomally unstable cell lines.            	Inhibition of the spindle assembly checkpoint kinase TTK causes chromosome mis-segregation and tumor cell death. However, high levels of TTK correlate with chromosomal instability (CIN), which can lead to aneuploidy. We show that treatment of tumor cells with the selective small molecule TTK inhibitor NTRC 0066-0 overrides the mitotic checkpoint, irrespective of cell line sensitivity. In stable aneuploid cells NTRC 0066-0 induced acute CIN, whereas in cells with high levels of pre-existing CIN there was only a small additional fraction of cells mis-segregating their chromosomes. In proliferation assays stable aneuploid cells were more sensitive than cell lines with pre-existing CIN. Tetraploids are thought to be an intermediate between diploid and unstable aneuploid cells. TTK inhibitors had the same potency on post-tetraploid and parental diploid cells, which is remarkable because the post-tetraploids are more resistant to mitotic drugs. Finally, we confirm that the reference compound reversine is a TTK inhibitor and like NTRC 0066-0, inhibits the proliferation of patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids. In contrast, treatment with TTK inhibitor did not reduce the viability of non-proliferating T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells samples. Consequently, TTK inhibitor therapy is expected to spare non-dividing cells, and may be used to target stable aneuploid tumors.	
25038433        	ADAM10 regulates Notch function in intestinal stem cells of mice.            	A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) is a cell surface sheddase that regulates physiologic processes, including Notch signaling. ADAM10 is expressed in all intestinal epithelial cell types, but the requirement for ADAM10 signaling in crypt homeostasis is not well defined.                We analyzed intestinal tissues from mice with constitutive (Vil-Cre;Adam10(f/f) mice) and conditional (Vil-CreER;Adam10(f/f) and Leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCR5 [Lgr5]-CreER;Adam10(f/f) mice) deletion of ADAM10. We performed cell lineage-tracing experiments in mice that expressed a gain-of-function allele of Notch in the intestine (Rosa26(NICD)), or mice with intestine-specific disruption of Notch (Rosa26(DN-MAML)), to examine the effects of ADAM10 deletion on cell fate specification and intestinal stem cell maintenance.                Loss of ADAM10 from developing and adult intestine caused lethality associated with altered intestinal morphology, reduced progenitor cell proliferation, and increased secretory cell differentiation. ADAM10 deletion led to the replacement of intestinal cell progenitors with 2 distinct, post-mitotic, secretory cell lineages: intermediate-like (Paneth/goblet) and enteroendocrine cells. Based on analysis of Rosa26(NICD) and Rosa26(DN-MAML) mice, we determined that ADAM10 controls these cell fate decisions by regulating Notch signaling. Cell lineage-tracing experiments showed that ADAM10 is required for survival of Lgr5(+) crypt-based columnar cells. Our findings indicate that Notch-activated stem cells have a competitive advantage for occupation of the stem cell niche.                ADAM10 acts in a cell autonomous manner within the intestinal crypt compartment to regulate Notch signaling. This process is required for progenitor cell lineage specification and crypt-based columnar cell maintenance.                Copyright © 2014 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

26915950        	Generation and characterization of rat liver stem cell lines and their engraftment in a rat model of liver failure.            	The rat is an important model for liver regeneration. However, there is no in vitro culture system that can capture the massive proliferation that can be observed after partial hepatectomy in rats. We here describe the generation of rat liver stem cell lines. Rat liver stem cells, which grow as cystic organoids, were characterized by high expression of the stem cell marker Lgr5, by the expression of liver progenitor and duct markers, and by low expression of hepatocyte markers, oval cell markers, and stellate cell markers. Prolonged cultures of rat liver organoids depended on high levels of WNT-signalling and the inhibition of BMP-signaling. Upon transplantation of clonal lines to a Fah(-/-) Il2rg(-/-) rat model of liver failure, the rat liver stem cells engrafted into the host liver where they differentiated into areas with FAH and Albumin positive hepatocytes. Rat liver stem cell lines hold potential as consistent reliable cell sources for pharmacological, toxicological or metabolic studies. In addition, rat liver stem cell lines may contribute to the development of regenerative medicine in liver disease. To our knowledge, the here described liver stem cell lines represent the first organoid culture system in the rat.	
32646874        	Predicting Gemcitabine Delivery by 18F-FAC PET in Murine Models of Pancreatic Cancer.            	18F-FAC (2'-deoxy-2'-18F-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine) has close structural similarity to gemcitabine and thus offers the potential to image drug delivery to tumors. We compared tumor 18F-FAC PET images with 14C-gemcitabine levels, established ex vivo, in 3 mouse models of pancreatic cancer. We further modified tumor gemcitabine levels with injectable PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) to test whether changes in gemcitabine would be tracked by 18F-FAC. Methods:18F-FAC was synthesized as described previously. Three patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were grown in the flanks of NSG mice. Mice were given PEGPH20 or vehicle intravenously 24 h before coinjection of 18F-FAC and 14C-gemcitabine. Animals were euthanized and imaged 1 h after tracer administration. Tumor and muscle uptake of both 18F-FAC and 14C-gemcitabine was obtained ex vivo. The efficacy of PEPGPH20 was validated through staining with hyaluronic acid binding protein. Additionally, an organoid culture, initiated from a KPC (Pdx-1 Cre LSL-KrasG12D LSL-p53R172H) tumor, was used to generate orthotopically growing tumors in C57BL/6J mice, and these tumors were then serially transplanted. Animals were injected with PEGPH20 and 14C-gemcitabine as described above to validate increased drug uptake by ex vivo assay. PET/MR images were obtained using a PET insert on a 7-T MR scanner. Animals were imaged immediately before injection with PEGPH20 and again 24 h later. Results: Tumor-to-muscle ratios of 14C-gemcitabine and 18F-FAC correlated well across all PDX models and treatments (R2 = 0.78). There was a significant increase in the tumor PET signal in PEGPH20-treated PDX animals, and this signal was matched in ex vivo counts for 2 of 3 models. In KPC-derived tumors, PEGPH20 raised 14C-gemcitabine levels (tumor-to-muscle ratio of 1.9 vs. 2.4, control vs. treated, P = 0.013). PET/MR 18F-FAC images showed a 12% increase in tumor 18F-FAC uptake after PEGPH20 treatment (P = 0.023). PEGPH20-treated animals uniformly displayed clear reductions in hyaluronic acid staining. Conclusion:18F-FAC PET was shown to be a good surrogate for gemcitabine uptake and, when combined with MR, to successfully determine drug uptake in tumors growing in the pancreas. PEGPH20 had moderate effects on tumor uptake of gemcitabine.                © 2021 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.	
32805281        	The Long Noncoding RNA CCAT2 Induces Chromosomal Instability Through BOP1-AURKB Signaling.            	Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a carcinogenesis event that promotes metastasis and resistance to therapy by unclear mechanisms. Expression of the colon cancer-associated transcript 2 gene (CCAT2), which encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), associates with CIN, but little is known about how CCAT2 lncRNA regulates this cancer enabling characteristic.                We performed cytogenetic analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines (HCT116, KM12C/SM, and HT29) overexpressing CCAT2 and colon organoids from C57BL/6N mice with the CCAT2 transgene and without (controls). CRC cells were also analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, γ-H2AX, and senescence assays. CCAT2 transgene and control mice were given azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium to induce colon tumors. We performed gene expression array and mass spectrometry to detect downstream targets of CCAT2 lncRNA. We characterized interactions between CCAT2 with downstream proteins using MS2 pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, and selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analyses. Downstream proteins were overexpressed in CRC cells and analyzed for CIN. Gene expression levels were measured in CRC and non-tumor tissues from 5 cohorts, comprising more than 900 patients.                High expression of CCAT2 induced CIN in CRC cell lines and increased resistance to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Mice that expressed the CCAT2 transgene developed chromosome abnormalities, and colon organoids derived from crypt cells of these mice had a higher percentage of chromosome abnormalities compared with organoids from control mice. The transgenic mice given azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium developed more and larger colon polyps than control mice given these agents. Microarray analysis and mass spectrometry indicated that expression of CCAT2 increased expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. CCAT2 lncRNA interacted directly with and stabilized BOP1 ribosomal biogenesis factor (BOP1). CCAT2 also increased expression of MYC, which activated expression of BOP1. Overexpression of BOP1 in CRC cell lines resulted in chromosomal missegregation errors, and increased colony formation, and invasiveness, whereas BOP1 knockdown reduced viability. BOP1 promoted CIN by increasing the active form of aurora kinase B, which regulates chromosomal segregation. BOP1 was overexpressed in polyp tissues from CCAT2 transgenic mice compared with healthy tissue. CCAT2 lncRNA and BOP1 mRNA or protein were all increased in microsatellite stable tumors (characterized by CIN), but not in tumors with microsatellite instability compared with nontumor tissues. Increased levels of CCAT2 lncRNA and BOP1 mRNA correlated with each other and with shorter survival times of patients.                We found that overexpression of CCAT2 in colon cells promotes CIN and carcinogenesis by stabilizing and inducing expression of BOP1 an activator of aurora kinase B. Strategies to target this pathway might be developed for treatment of patients with microsatellite stable colorectal tumors.                Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

24350919        	Proteomics of cancer stem cells.            	New understanding of cancer stem cell (CSC) biology continues to emerge due to development of novel methods in genomics and proteomics. Analysis of nucleic acids (RNA, DNA) is widely used to elucidate molecular perturbations in malignant tumors and carcinoma cells, however genome data do not reflect the functional activities of encoded proteins. Therefore proteome-based methods could enhance knowledge about deregulation of pathways as a result of altered expression and activities of proteins in CSC.                A sufficient number of CSC for proteomic analyses can be obtained in a variety of ways: Fluorescence (FACS) and magnetic (MACS) activated cell sorting, laser cell capture microdissection, and three-dimensional spheroid/organoid cell culture. These methods to enrich and isolate CSC can be performed either with or without staining using antibodies against currently known CSC-specific cell surface molecules, such as clusters of differentiation 44, 24, 133 (CD44, CD24, CD133), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), aldehyde-dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1), etc. The most important limitation on using antibody-based staining of CSC is that we still do not possess definitive CSC surface markers. This review article discusses methods that could be used to study protein profiling of CSC and to identify novel CSC-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets.                Despite an opinion that the proteomic approach is time-consuming, laborious and difficult, this method can be used effectively to clarify which pathways are involved in regulating various intratumoral processes, including activation of CSC. Based on this point of view, searching and identification of single molecules as biomarkers or therapeutic targets could become possible when CSC-associated pathways are well described and clearly understood due to detailed investigation of the protein patterns in pre-clinical models and clinical samples.	
25846753        	Targeting Toll-like receptor 2 inhibits growth of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.            	Infection-driven inflammation has been proposed to be involved in the tumorigenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Oral HNSCC is often colonized with microbes such as gram-positive bacteria and yeast, where ligands derived from their wall components have been shown to specifically bind to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Although TLR2 has been described to be expressed in oral HNSCC, its function has not been well characterized. Here, we show the expression of TLR2 in both HNSCC cell lines and primary patient-derived HNSCC xenograft tumors. Activation of TLR2 with a yeast-derived ligand of TLR2, zymosan, promoted organoid formation in an ex vivo model of tumor growth, while blockade with anti-TLR2 antibodies inhibited organoid formation. Zymosan also induced phosphorylation of ERK and the p65 subunit of NF-κB, which was inhibited in the presence of anti-TLR2 antibodies, indicating that this receptor is functional in HNSCC and that the signaling through these pathways is intact. TLR2 blockade also inhibited growth of human xenografted tumors in immunodeficient mice. In summary, our data show that TLR2 is a functional receptor expressed in human HNSCC that plays a direct pro-tumorigenic role, and that it can be therapeutically targeted with blocking antibodies to reduce tumor growth.	
25762290        	A human colonic crypt culture system to study regulation of stem cell-driven tissue renewal and physiological function.            	The intestinal epithelium is one of the most rapidly renewing tissues in the human body and fulfils vital physiological roles such as barrier function and transport of nutrients and fluid. Investigation of gut epithelial physiology in health and disease has been hampered by the lack of ex vivo models of the native human intestinal epithelium. Recently, remarkable progress has been made in defining intestinal stem cells and in generating intestinal organoid cultures. In parallel, we have developed a 3D culture system of the native human colonic epithelium that recapitulates the topological hierarchy of stem cell-driven tissue renewal and permits the physiological study of native polarized epithelial cells. Here we describe methods to establish 3D cultures of intact human colonic crypts and conduct real-time imaging of intestinal tissue renewal, cellular signalling, and physiological function, in conjunction with manipulation of gene expression by lentiviral or adenoviral transduction. Visualization of mRNA- and protein-expression patterns in cultured human colonic crypts, and cross-validation with crypts derived from fixed mucosal biopsies, is also described. Alongside studies using intestinal organoids, the near-native human colonic crypt culture model will help to bridge the gap that exists between investigation of colon cancer cell lines and/or animal (tissue) studies, and progression to clinical trials. To this end, the near native human colonic crypt model provides a platform to aid the development of novel strategies for the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.	
33158814        	Enhanced Efficacy of Simultaneous PD-1 and PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Blockade in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.            	Immune therapies have had limited efficacy in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), as the cellular targets and mechanism(s) of action of these agents in HGSC are unknown. Here we performed immune functional and single-cell RNA sequencing transcriptional profiling on novel HGSC organoid/immune cell co-cultures treated with a unique bispecific anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody compared with monospecific anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 controls. Comparing the functions of these agents across all immune cell types in real time identified key immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targets that have eluded currently available monospecific therapies. The bispecific antibody induced superior cellular state changes in both T and natural killer (NK) cells. It uniquely induced NK cells to transition from inert to more active and cytotoxic phenotypes, implicating NK cells as a key missing component of the current ICB-induced immune response in HGSC. It also induced a subset of CD8 T cells to transition from naïve to more active and cytotoxic progenitor-exhausted phenotypes post-treatment, revealing the small, previously uncharacterized population of CD8 T cells responding to ICB in HGSC. These state changes were driven partially through bispecific antibody-induced downregulation of the bromodomain-containing protein BRD1. Small-molecule inhibition of BRD1 induced similar state changes in vitro and demonstrated efficacy in vivo, validating the co-culture results. Our results demonstrate that state changes in both NK and a subset of T cells may be critical in inducing an effective anti-tumor immune response and suggest that immune therapies able to induce such cellular state changes, such as BRD1 inhibitors, may have increased efficacy in HGSC. SIGNIFICANCE: This study indicates that increased efficacy of immune therapies in ovarian cancer is driven by state changes of NK and small subsets of CD8 T cells into active and cytotoxic states.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
33039558        	The meiosis-specific cohesin component stromal antigen 3 promotes cell migration and chemotherapeutic resistance in colorectal cancer.            	Chromosome instability is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Stromal antigen (STAG) 3 is a core component of the meiosis-specific cohesin complex, which regulates sister chromatid cohesion. Although aberrantly activated genes encoding the cohesin complex have been identified in cancers, little is known about the role of STAG3 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we evaluated the prognostic impact and role of STAG3 in CRC. Analysis of 172 CRC surgical specimens revealed that high STAG3 expression was associated with poor prognosis. STAG3 knockdown inhibited cell migration and increased drug sensitivity to oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate, and BRAF inhibitor in CRC cell lines. The enhanced drug sensitivity was also confirmed in a human organoid established from a CRC specimen. Moreover, suppression of STAG3 increased γH2AX foci. Particularly, in BRAF-mutant CRC cells, STAG3 silencing suppressed the expression of snail family transcriptional repressor 1 and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase via upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase 6. Our findings suggest that STAG3 is related to poor clinical outcomes and promotes metastasis and chemotherapeutic resistance in CRC. STAG3 may be a novel prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for CRC.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	
29808009        	Mutant KRAS-driven cancers depend on PTPN11/SHP2 phosphatase.            	The ubiquitously expressed non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, is involved in signal transduction downstream of multiple growth factor, cytokine and integrin receptors1. Its requirement for complete RAS-MAPK activation and its role as a negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling have established SHP2 as an essential player in oncogenic signaling pathways1-7. Recently, a novel potent allosteric SHP2 inhibitor was presented as a viable therapeutic option for receptor tyrosine kinase-driven cancers, but was shown to be ineffective in KRAS-mutant tumor cell lines in vitro8. Here, we report a central and indispensable role for SHP2 in oncogenic KRAS-driven tumors. Genetic deletion of Ptpn11 profoundly inhibited tumor development in mutant KRAS-driven murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. We provide evidence for a critical dependence of mutant KRAS on SHP2 during carcinogenesis. Deletion or inhibition of SHP2 in established tumors delayed tumor progression but was not sufficient to achieve tumor regression. However, SHP2 was necessary for resistance mechanisms upon blockade of MEK. Synergy was observed when both SHP2 and MEK were targeted, resulting in sustained tumor growth control in murine and human patient-derived organoids and xenograft models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. Our data indicate the clinical utility of dual SHP2/MEK inhibition as a targeted therapy approach for KRAS-mutant cancers.	
31569425        	Integration of Bioinformatics Resources Reveals the Therapeutic Benefits of Gemcitabine and Cell Cycle Intervention in SMAD4-Deleted Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common and aggressive type of pancreatic cancer. The five-year survival rate of PDAC is very low (less than 8%), which is associated with the late diagnosis, high metastatic potential, and resistance to therapeutic agents. The identification of better prognostic or therapeutic biomarker may have clinical benefits for PDAC treatment. SMAD4, a central mediator of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway, is considered a tumor suppressor gene. SMAD4 inactivation is frequently found in PDAC. However, its role in prognosis and therapeutics of PDAC is still unclear. In this study, we applied bioinformatics approaches, and integrated publicly available resources, to investigate the role of SMAD4 gene deletion in PDAC. We found that SMAD4 deletion was associated with poorer disease-free, but not overall, survival in PDAC patients. Cancer hallmark enrichment and pathway analysis suggested that the upregulation of cell cycle-related genes in SMAD4-deleted PDAC. Chemotherapy response profiling of PDAC cell lines and patient-derived organoids revealed that SMAD4-deleted PDAC was sensitive to gemcitabine, the first-line treatment for PDAC, and specific cell cycle-targeting drugs. Taken together, our study provides an insight into the prognostic and therapeutic roles of SMAD4 gene deletion in PDAC, and SMAD4 gene copy numbers may be used as a therapeutic biomarker for PDAC treatment.	
24069507        	Transgenic mammary epithelial osteopontin (spp1) expression induces proliferation and alveologenesis.            	Osteopontin (OPN) Spp1 is involved in differentiation of the mammary gland. We engineered mice to overexpress OPN in mammary epithelium and describe an altered mammary phenotype. Three transgenic (Tg) founder lines FVB/N Tg(MMTV-Opn)((1-3BOR)) were propagated after FVB/NJ pronuclear injections. Mammary glands from Tg-OPN mice compared to littermate controls showed, at 4 weeks of age, exaggerated terminal end buds; at 8 and 12 weeks, more numerous and complex ducts with increased luminal protein; and at 16 weeks, increased lobulogenesis. Lactational Tg-OPN mammary glands showed more rapid lobulogenesis and lactational changes with slower gland involution and regression following weaning. Ex vivo lobulogenesis was noticeably increased from organoids of Tg-OPN mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed cytoplasmic OPN accumulation and increased Ki-67 positive mammary epithelial cells in Tg-OPN mammary glands. OPN appears to convey a proliferative stimulus for mammary epithelial cells and alters development and differentiation. These OPN mammary overexpressing mice provide a means to study the role of OPN in cancer progression.	
33445709        	Mimicking Tumor Hypoxia in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Employing Three-Dimensional In Vitro Models.            	Hypoxia is the most common microenvironment feature of lung cancer tumors, which affects cancer progression, metastasis and metabolism. Oxygen induces both proteomic and genomic changes within tumor cells, which cause many alternations in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review defines current knowledge in the field of tumor hypoxia in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including biology, biomarkers, in vitro and in vivo studies and also hypoxia imaging and detection. While classic two-dimensional (2D) in vitro research models reveal some hypoxia dependent manifestations, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models more accurately replicate the hypoxic TME. In this study, a systematic review of the current NSCLC 3D models that have been able to mimic the hypoxic TME is presented. The multicellular tumor spheroid, organoids, scaffolds, microfluidic devices and 3D bioprinting currently being utilized in NSCLC hypoxia studies are reviewed. Additionally, the utilization of 3D in vitro models for exploring biological and therapeutic parameters in the future is described.	
30670776        	Cnnm4 deficiency suppresses Ca2+ signaling and promotes cell proliferation in the colon epithelia.            	CNNM4 is a Mg2+ transporter highly expressed in the colon epithelia. Its importance in regulating intracellular Mg2+ levels and cancer development has been documented, but how CNNM4 function affects the dynamic homeostasis of the epithelial tissue remains unclear. Here, we show that Cnnm4 deficiency promotes cell proliferation and partly suppresses cell differentiation in the colon epithelia, making them vulnerable to cancer development. Such phenotypic characteristics are highly similar to those of mice lacking Trpv1, which encodes the cation channel involved in capsaicin-stimulated Ca2+ influx. Indeed, Ca2+-imaging analyses using the organoid culture reveal that Ca2+ influx stimulated by capsaicin is greatly impaired by Cnnm4 deficiency. Moreover, EGF receptor signaling is constitutively activated in the colon epithelia of Cnnm4-deficient mice, as is the case with Trpv1-deficient mice. The administration of gefitinib, a clinically available inhibitor of EGF receptor, cancels the augmented proliferation of cells observed in Cnnm4-deficient mice. Collectively, these results establish the functional interplay between Mg2+ and Ca2+ in the colon epithelia, which is crucial for maintaining the dynamic homeostasis of the epithelial tissue.	
25143365        	Denervation suppresses gastric tumorigenesis.            	The nervous system plays an important role in the regulation of epithelial homeostasis and has also been postulated to play a role in tumorigenesis. We provide evidence that proper innervation is critical at all stages of gastric tumorigenesis. In three separate mouse models of gastric cancer, surgical or pharmacological denervation of the stomach (bilateral or unilateral truncal vagotomy, or local injection of botulinum toxin type A) markedly reduced tumor incidence and progression, but only in the denervated portion of the stomach. Vagotomy or botulinum toxin type A treatment also enhanced the therapeutic effects of systemic chemotherapy and prolonged survival. Denervation-induced suppression of tumorigenesis was associated with inhibition of Wnt signaling and suppression of stem cell expansion. In gastric organoid cultures, neurons stimulated growth in a Wnt-mediated fashion through cholinergic signaling. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockout of the muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor suppressed gastric tumorigenesis. In gastric cancer patients, tumor stage correlated with neural density and activated Wnt signaling, whereas vagotomy reduced the risk of gastric cancer. Together, our findings suggest that vagal innervation contributes to gastric tumorigenesis via M3 receptor-mediated Wnt signaling in the stem cells, and that denervation might represent a feasible strategy for the control of gastric cancer.

28057213        	A New Molecular Mechanism Underlying the Antitumor Effect of DNA Methylation Inhibitors via an Antiviral Immune Response.            	Chromatin remodeling mediated by DNA methylation and histone modifications play critical roles in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs, and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Many studies have shown that aberrant DNA methylation and histone modifications are associated with the initiation and progression of various malignancies. Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer is generally mediated by DNA hypermethylation of CpG island promoters and histone modifications such as histone deacetylation, methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9), and trimethylation of H3K27. Chromatin-modifying drugs such as DNA methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors have clinical promise for cancer therapy. However, details of the mechanisms responsible for the antitumor effects of these drugs have been unclear. Recently, a new molecular mechanism for the antitumor effect of DNA methylation inhibitors has been proposed: induction of interferon-responsive genes via double-stranded RNAs derived from ERVs. We have also confirmed the same effect of DNA demethylation using a 3D culture system for stem cells known as organoid culture. Our findings indicated that DNA demethylation suppresses the proliferation of cancer-initiating cells by inducing an antiviral response, including activation of interferon-responsive genes. Treatment with DNA methylation inhibitors to activate a growth-inhibiting immune response may be an effective therapeutic approach for malignant disorders.                © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

28500323        	Development of an inducible mouse model of iRFP713 to track recombinase activity and tumour development in vivo.            	While the use of bioluminescent proteins for molecular imaging is a powerful technology to further our understanding of complex processes, fluorescent labeling with visible light fluorescent proteins such as GFP and RFP suffers from poor tissue penetration and high background autofluorescence. To overcome these limitations, we generated an inducible knock-in mouse model of iRFP713. This model was used to assess Cre activity in a Rosa Cre-ER background and quantify Cre activity upon different tamoxifen treatments in several organs. We also show that iRFP can be readily detected in 3D organoid cultures, FACS analysis and in vivo tumour models. Taken together we demonstrate that iRFP713 is a progressive step in in vivo imaging and analysis that widens the optical imaging window to the near-infrared spectrum, thereby allowing deeper tissue penetration, quicker image acquisition without the need to inject substrates and a better signal to background ratio in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs).	
31530281        	Abi1 loss drives prostate tumorigenesis through activation of EMT and non-canonical WNT signaling.            	Prostate cancer development involves various mechanisms, which are poorly understood but pointing to epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) as the key mechanism in progression to metastatic disease. ABI1, a member of WAVE complex and actin cytoskeleton regulator and adaptor protein, acts as tumor suppressor in prostate cancer but the role of ABI1 in EMT is not clear.                To investigate the molecular mechanism by which loss of ABI1 contributes to tumor progression, we disrupted the ABI1 gene in the benign prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cell line and determined its phenotype. Levels of ABI1 expression in prostate organoid tumor cell lines was evaluated by Western blotting and RNA sequencing. ABI1 expression and its association with prostate tumor grade was evaluated in a TMA cohort of 505 patients and metastatic cell lines.                Low ABI1 expression is associated with biochemical recurrence, metastasis and death (p = 0.038). Moreover, ABI1 expression was significantly decreased in Gleason pattern 5 vs. pattern 4 (p = 0.0025) and 3 (p = 0.0012), indicating an association between low ABI1 expression and highly invasive prostate tumors. Disruption of ABI1 gene in RWPE-1 cell line resulted in gain of an invasive phenotype, which was characterized by a loss of cell-cell adhesion markers and increased migratory ability of RWPE-1 spheroids. Through RNA sequencing and protein expression analysis, we discovered that ABI1 loss leads to activation of non-canonical WNT signaling and EMT pathways, which are rescued by re-expression of ABI1. Furthermore, an increase in STAT3 phosphorylation upon ABI1 inactivation and the evidence of a high-affinity interaction between the FYN SH2 domain and ABI1 pY421 support a model in which ABI1 acts as a gatekeeper of non-canonical WNT-EMT pathway activation downstream of the FZD2 receptor.                ABI1 controls prostate tumor progression and epithelial plasticity through regulation of EMT-WNT pathway. Here we discovered that ABI1 inhibits EMT through suppressing FYN-STAT3 activation downstream from non-canonical WNT signaling thus providing a novel mechanism of prostate tumor suppression.	
33189701        	Dicarbonyl Electrophiles Mediate Inflammation-Induced Gastrointestinal Carcinogenesis.            	Inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract may lead to the development of cancer. Dicarbonyl electrophiles, such as isolevuglandins (isoLGs), are generated from lipid peroxidation during the inflammatory response and form covalent adducts with amine-containing macromolecules. Thus, we sought to determine the role of dicarbonyl electrophiles in inflammation-associated carcinogenesis.                The formation of isoLG adducts was analyzed in the gastric tissues of patients infected with Helicobacter pylori from gastritis to precancerous intestinal metaplasia, in human gastric organoids, and in patients with colitis and colitis-associated carcinoma (CAC). The effect on cancer development of a potent scavenger of dicarbonyl electrophiles, 5-ethyl-2-hydroxybenzylamine (EtHOBA), was determined in transgenic FVB/N insulin-gastrin (INS-GAS) mice and Mongolian gerbils as models of H pylori-induced carcinogenesis and in C57BL/6 mice treated with azoxymethane-dextran sulfate sodium as a model of CAC. The effect of EtHOBA on mutations in gastric epithelial cells of H pylori-infected INS-GAS mice was assessed by whole-exome sequencing.                We show increased isoLG adducts in gastric epithelial cell nuclei in patients with gastritis and intestinal metaplasia and in human gastric organoids infected with H pylori. EtHOBA inhibited gastric carcinoma in infected INS-GAS mice and gerbils and attenuated isoLG adducts, DNA damage, and somatic mutation frequency. Additionally, isoLG adducts were elevated in tissues from patients with colitis, colitis-associated dysplasia, and CAC as well as in dysplastic tumors of C57BL/6 mice treated with azoxymethane-dextran sulfate sodium. In this model, EtHOBA significantly reduced adduct formation, tumorigenesis, and dysplasia severity.                Dicarbonyl electrophiles represent a link between inflammation and somatic genomic alterations and are thus key targets for cancer chemoprevention.                Published by Elsevier Inc.	
30126547        	Characterization of Peribiliary Gland-Constituting Cells Based on Differential Expression of Trophoblast Cell Surface Protein 2 in Biliary Tract.            	Peribiliary glands (PBGs) are accessory glands with mucinous and serous acini in the biliary tree. The PBG is composed of a heterogeneous cell population, such as mucus- and pancreatic enzyme-producing epithelial cells, whereas it constitutes niches for multipotential stem/progenitor cells in the human extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD). By contrast, the nature of PBGs in the mouse EHBD remains unclear. Our aim was to establish a method for isolating and characterizing PBG-constituting cells in the mouse EHBD. We found that trophoblast cell surface protein 2 (Trop2) was expressed in the luminal epithelium of mouse EHBD exclusively, but not in the PBG. On the basis of the differential expression profile of Trop2, lumen-forming biliary epithelial cells (LBECs) and PBG-constituting epithelial cells (PBECs) were separately isolated for further characterization. Gene expression analysis revealed that the isolated mouse PBECs expressed several marker genes related to human PBGs. In the colony formation assay, PBECs showed significantly higher colony formation capacity than LBECs. In the organoid formation assay, PBECs formed cystic organoid with LBEC-like phenotype. Interestingly, PBECs proliferated, accompanied by reexpression of Trop2 in vivo after bile duct ligation. Furthermore, the unique expression profile of Trop2 was conserved in human EHBD. Our findings indicate that Trop2 is a useful marker in investigating the pathophysiological roles and characteristics of mouse and human PBGs in biliary diseases.

32795421        	"Reprogram Enablement" as an Assay for Identifying Early Oncogenic Pathways by Their Ability to Allow Neoplastic Cells to Reacquire an Epiblast State.            	One approach to understanding how tissue-specific cancers emerge is to determine the requirements for "reprograming" such neoplastic cells back to their developmentally normal primordial pre-malignant epiblast-like pluripotent state and then scrutinizing their spontaneous reconversion to a neoplasm, perhaps rendering salient the earliest pivotal oncogenic pathway(s) (before other aberrations accumulate in the adult tumor). For the prototypical malignancy anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), we found that tonic RAS reduction was obligatory for reprogramming cancer cells to a normal epiblast-emulating cells, confirmed by changes in their transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles, loss of neoplastic behavior, and ability to derive normal somatic cells from their "epiblast organoids." Without such suppression, ATCs re-emerged from the clones. Hence, for ATC, RAS inhibition was its "reprogram enablement" (RE) factor. Each cancer likely has its own RE factor; identifying it may illuminate pre-malignant risk markers, better classifications, therapeutic targets, and tissue-specification of a previously pluripotent, now neoplastic, cell.

32711097        	Intestinal estrogen receptor beta suppresses colon inflammation and tumorigenesis in both sexes.            	Estrogen hormones protect against colorectal cancer (CRC) and a preventative role of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) on CRC has been supported using full knockout animals. However, it is unclear through which cells or organ ERβ mediates this effect. To investigate the functional role of intestinal ERβ during colitis-associated CRC we used intestine-specific ERβ knockout mice treated with azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate, followed by ex vivo organoid culture to corroborate intrinsic effects. We explored genome-wide impact on TNFα signaling using human CRC cell lines and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to mechanistically characterize the regulation of ERβ. Increased tumor formation in males and tumor size in females was noted upon intestine-specific ERβ knockout, accompanied by enhanced local expression of TNFα, deregulation of key NFκB targets, and increased colon ulceration. Unexpectedly, we noted especially strong effects in males. We corroborated that intestinal ERβ protects against TNFα-induced damage intrinsically, and characterized an underlying genome-wide signaling mechanism in CRC cell lines whereby ERβ binds to cis-regulatory chromatin areas of key NFκB regulators. Our results support a protective role of intestinal ERβ against colitis-associated CRC, proposing new therapeutic strategies.                Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

28678427        	Clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas: are their differences attributable to distinct cells of origin?            	Endometrial epithelium is the presumed tissue of origin for both eutopic and endometriosis-derived clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas. We had previously hypothesized that the morphological, biological and clinical differences between these carcinomas are due to histotype-specific mutations. Although some mutations and genomic landscape features are more likely to be found in one of these histotypes, we were not able to identify a single class of mutations that was exclusively present in one histotype and not the other. This lack of genomic differences led us to an alternative hypothesis that these cancers could arise from distinct cells of origin within endometrial tissue, and that it is the cellular context that accounts for their differences. In a proteomic screen, we identified cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) as a marker for clear cell carcinoma, as it is expressed at high levels in clear cell carcinomas of the ovary and endometrium. In the current study, we analysed normal Müllerian tissues, and found that CTH is expressed in ciliated cells of endometrium (both eutopic endometrium and endometriosis) and fallopian tubes. We then demonstrated that other ciliated cell markers are expressed in clear cell carcinomas, whereas endometrial secretory cell markers are expressed in endometrioid carcinomas. The same differential staining of secretory and ciliated cells was demonstrable in a three-dimensional organoid culture system, in which stem cells were stimulated to differentiate into an admixture of secretory and ciliated cells. These data suggest that endometrioid carcinomas are derived from cells of the secretory cell lineage, whereas clear cell carcinomas are derived from, or have similarities to, cells of the ciliated cell lineage.

31978326        	Hyperactivation of TORC1 Drives Resistance to the Pan-HER Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Neratinib in HER2-Mutant Cancers.            	We developed neratinib-resistant HER2-mutant cancer cells by gradual dose escalation. RNA sequencing identified TORC1 signaling as an actionable mechanism of drug resistance. Primary and acquired neratinib resistance in HER2-mutant breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) was also associated with TORC1 hyperactivity. Genetic suppression of RAPTOR or RHEB ablated P-S6 and restored sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The combination of the TORC1 inhibitor everolimus and neratinib potently arrested the growth of neratinib-resistant xenografts and organoids established from neratinib-resistant PDXs. RNA and whole-exome sequencing revealed RAS-mediated TORC1 activation in a subset of neratinib-resistant models. DNA sequencing of HER2-mutant tumors clinically refractory to neratinib, as well as circulating tumor DNA profiling of patients who progressed on neratinib, showed enrichment of genomic alterations that converge to activate the mTOR pathway.

32171661        	MSIsensor-pro: Fast, Accurate, and Matched-normal-sample-free Detection of Microsatellite Instability.            	Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a key biomarker for cancer therapy and prognosis. Traditional experimental assays are laborious and time-consuming, and next-generation sequencing-based computational methods do not work on leukemia samples, paraffin-embedded samples, or patient-derived xenografts/organoids, due to the requirement of matched normal samples. Herein, we developed MSIsensor-pro, an open-source single sample MSI scoring method for research and clinical applications. MSIsensor-pro introduces a multinomial distribution model to quantify polymerase slippages for each tumor sample and a discriminative site selection method to enable MSI detection without matched normal samples. We demonstrate that MSIsensor-pro is an ultrafast, accurate, and robust MSI calling method. Using samples with various sequencing depths and tumor purities, MSIsensor-pro significantly outperformed the current leading methods in both accuracy and computational cost. MSIsensor-pro is available at https://github.com/xjtu-omics/msisensor-pro and free for non-commercial use, while a commercial license is provided upon request.

30102978        	Pharmacological targeting of p38 MAP-Kinase 6 (MAP2K6) inhibits the growth of esophageal adenocarcinoma.            	Drug repurposing with a better understanding of the underlying mechanism has provided new avenues to find treatment for malignancies. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a rapidly increasing cancer with a dismal 5-year survival rate of <15%. Lack of efficient treatment options contributes to the high mortality rate of EAC. To find new therapy against EAC we performed unbiased drug screening of an FDA-approved drug library and identified that the cardiac glycosides including Ouabain, Digoxin and Digitoxin efficiently inhibit the proliferation of EAC cell lines (OE33 and OE19) both in vitro and in vivo. RNA-Sequencing analysis combined with RNAi screening revealed that Ouabain suppresses the proliferation of EAC cells through downregulation of p38 MAP-Kinase 6 (MAP2K6, also known as MKK6). Consistently, shRNA-mediated knockdown of MKK6 reduced the proliferation of EAC cells and tumor growth. Further analysis demonstrated that MKK6 inhibition leads to the reduced levels of the transcription factor SOX9. In line with this finding, deletion of SOX9 with CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in decreased proliferation of EACs in 3D organoid culture and reduced tumor growth. Together these findings establish a druggable axis that can be harnessed for therapeutic gain against EAC.                Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33428749        	Pten Deficiency Leads To Proteasome Addiction, A Novel Vulnerability In Glioblastoma.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults with a median survival of approximately 15 months, therefore, more effective treatment options for GBM are required. To identify new drugs targeting glioblastomas, we performed a high throughput drug screen using patient-derived neurospheres cultured to preferentially retain their glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) phenotype.                High throughput drug screening was performed on GSCs followed by a dose response assay of the 5 identified original "hits". A PI3K/mTOR dependency to a proteasome inhibitor (carfilzomib), was confirmed by genetic and pharmacologic experiments. Proteasome inhibition response signatures were derived from proteomic and bioinformatic analysis. Molecular mechanism of action was determined using 3-dimensional (3D) GBM organoid and preclinical orthotopic models.                We found that GSCs were highly sensitive to proteasome inhibition due to an underlying dependency on an increased protein synthesis rate, and loss of autophagy, associated with PTEN loss and activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. In contrast, combinatory inhibition of autophagy and the proteasome, resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity specifically in GSCs that did express PTEN. Finally, proteasome inhibition specifically increased cell death markers in 3D glioblastoma organoids, suppressed tumor growth, and increased survival of mice orthotopically engrafted with GSCs. As perturbations of the PI3K/mTOR pathway occur in nearly 50% of GBMs, these findings suggest that a significant fraction of these tumors could be vulnerable to proteasome inhibition.                Proteasome inhibition is a potential synthetic lethal therapeutic strategy for GBM with proteasome addiction due to a high protein synthesis rate and autophagy deficiency.                © The Author(s) 2021.

33617612        	Identifying subpopulations in multicellular systems by quantitative chemical imaging using label-free hyperspectral CARS microscopy.            	Quantitative hyperspectral coherent Raman scattering microscopy merges imaging with spectroscopy and utilises quantitative data analysis algorithms to extract physically meaningful chemical components, spectrally and spatially-resolved, with sub-cellular resolution. This label-free non-invasive method has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the complexity of living multicellular systems. Here, we have applied an in-house developed hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscope, combined with a quantitative data analysis pipeline, to imaging living mouse liver organoids as well as fixed mouse brain tissue sections xenografted with glioblastoma cells. We show that the method is capable of discriminating different cellular sub-populations, on the basis of their chemical content which is obtained from an unsupervised analysis, i.e. without prior knowledge. Specifically, in the organoids, we identify sub-populations of cells at different phases in the cell cycle, while in the brain tissue, we distinguish normal tissue from cancer cells, and, notably, tumours derived from transplanted cancer stem cells versus non-stem glioblastoma cells. The ability of the method to identify different sub-populations was validated by correlative fluorescence microscopy using fluorescent protein markers. These examples expand the application portfolio of quantitative chemical imaging by hyperspectral CARS microscopy to multicellular systems of significant biomedical relevance, pointing the way to new opportunities in non-invasive disease diagnostics.	
33509905        	Targeting BET Proteins BRD2 and BRD3 in Combination with PI3K-AKT Inhibition as a Therapeutic Strategy for Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma.            	Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a rare, chemo-resistant subtype of ovarian cancer. To identify novel therapeutic targets and combination therapies for OCCC, we subjected a set of patient-derived ovarian cancer cell lines to arrayed high-throughput siRNA and drug screening. The results indicated OCCC cells are vulnerable to knockdown of epigenetic gene targets such as bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins BRD2 and BRD3. Subsequent RNA interference assays, as well as BET inhibitor treatments, validated these BET proteins as potential therapeutic targets. Because development of resistance to single targeted agents is common, we next performed sensitizer drug screens to identify potential combination therapies with the BET inhibitor CPI0610. Several PI3K or AKT inhibitors were among the top drug combinations identified and subsequent work showed CPI0610 synergized with alpelisib or MK2206 by inducing p53-independent apoptosis. We further verified synergy between CPI0610 and PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors alpelisib, MK2206, or ipatasertib in tumor organoids obtained directly from patients with OCCC. These findings indicate further preclinical evaluation of BET inhibitors, alone or in combination with PI3K-AKT inhibitors for OCCC, is warranted.                ©2021 American Association for Cancer Research.	
26884425        	Autophagy mediates epithelial cytoprotection in eosinophilic oesophagitis.            	The influence of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE)-associated inflammation upon oesophageal epithelial biology remains poorly understood. We investigated the functional role of autophagy in oesophageal epithelial cells (keratinocytes) exposed to the inflammatory EoE milieu.                Functional consequences of genetic or pharmacological autophagy inhibition were assessed in endoscopic oesophageal biopsies, human oesophageal keratinocytes, single cell-derived ex vivo murine oesophageal organoids as well as a murine model recapitulating EoE-like inflammation and basal cell hyperplasia. Gene expression, morphological and functional characterisation of autophagy and oxidative stress were performed by transmission electron microscopy, immunostaining, immunoblotting, live cell imaging and flow cytometry.                EoE-relevant inflammatory conditions promoted autophagy and basal cell hyperplasia in three independent murine EoE models and oesophageal organoids. Inhibition of autophagic flux via chloroquine treatment augmented basal cell hyperplasia in these model systems. Oesophageal keratinocytes stimulated with EoE-relevant cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-13 exhibited activation of autophagic flux in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. Autophagy inhibition via chloroquine treatment or depletion of Beclin-1 or ATG-7, augmented oxidative stress induced by EoE-relevant stimuli in murine EoE, oesophageal organoids and human oesophageal keratinocytes. Oesophageal epithelia of paediatric EoE patients with active inflammation displayed increased autophagic vesicle content compared with normal and EoE remission subjects. Functional flow cytometric analysis revealed autophagic flux in human oesophageal biopsies.                Our findings reveal for the first time that autophagy may function as a cytoprotective mechanism to maintain epithelial redox balance and homeostasis under EoE inflammation-associated stress, providing mechanistic insights into the role of autophagy in EoE pathogenesis.

33536189        	Lipidome-based Targeting of STAT3-driven Breast Cancer Cells Using Poly-L-glutamic acid-coated Layer-by-Layer Nanoparticles.            	The oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 is aberrantly activated in 70% of breast cancers, including nearly all triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Since STAT3 is difficult to target directly, we considered whether metabolic changes driven by activated STAT3 could provide a therapeutic opportunity. We found that STAT3 prominently modulated several lipid classes, with most profound effects on N-acyl taurine and arachidonic acid, both of which are involved in plasma membrane remodeling. To exploit these metabolic changes therapeutically, we screened a library of layer-by-layer (LbL) nanoparticles (NP) differing in the surface layer that modulates interactivity with the cell membrane. We found that poly-L-glutamic acid (PLE)-coated NPs bind to STAT3-transformed breast cancer cells with 50% greater efficiency than to non-transformed cells, and the heightened PLE-NP binding to TNBC cells was attenuated by STAT3 inhibition. This effect was also observed in densely packed three-dimensional breast cancer organoids. As STAT3-transformed cells show greater resistance to cytotoxic agents, we evaluated if enhanced targeted delivery via PLE-NPs would provide a therapeutic advantage. We found that cisplatin-loaded PLE-NPs induced apoptosis of STAT3-driven cells at lower doses compared to both unencapsulated cisplatin and cisplatin-loaded non-targeted NPs. In addition, since radiation is commonly used in breast cancer treatment, and may alter cellular lipid distribution, we analyzed its effect on PLE-NP-cell binding. Irradiation of cells enhanced the STAT3-targeting properties of PLE-NPs in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting potential synergies between these therapeutic modalities. These findings suggest that cellular lipid changes driven by activated STAT3 may be exploited therapeutically using unique LbL nanoparticles.

26375443        	Automated tracking of tumor-stroma morphology in microtissues identifies functional targets within the tumor microenvironment for therapeutic intervention.            	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute an important part of the tumor microenvironment and promote invasion via paracrine functions and physical impact on the tumor. Although the importance of including CAFs into three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures has been acknowledged, computational support for quantitative live-cell measurements of complex cell cultures has been lacking. Here, we have developed a novel automated pipeline to model tumor-stroma interplay, track motility and quantify morphological changes of 3D co-cultures, in real-time live-cell settings. The platform consists of microtissues from prostate cancer cells, combined with CAFs in extracellular matrix that allows biochemical perturbation. Tracking of fibroblast dynamics revealed that CAFs guided the way for tumor cells to invade and increased the growth and invasiveness of tumor organoids. We utilized the platform to determine the efficacy of inhibitors in prostate cancer and the associated tumor microenvironment as a functional unit. Interestingly, certain inhibitors selectively disrupted tumor-CAF interactions, e.g. focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitors specifically blocked tumor growth and invasion concurrently with fibroblast spreading and motility. This complex phenotype was not detected in other standard in vitro models. These results highlight the advantage of our approach, which recapitulates tumor histology and can significantly improve cancer target validation in vitro.	
33410252        	Merlin deficiency alters the redox management program in breast cancer.            	The expression of Merlin tumor suppressor protein encoded by Neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene is remarkably decreased in metastatic breast cancer tissues. In order to recapitulate clinical evidence, we generated a unique, conditional Nf2-knockout (Nf2-/- ) mouse mammary tumor model. Merlin-deficient breast tumor cells and Nf2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) displayed a robustly invasive phenotype. Moreover, Nf2-/- MEFs presented with notable alterations in redox management networks, implicating a role for Merlin in redox homeostasis. This programmatic alteration resonated with pathways that emerged from breast tumor cells engineered for Merlin deficiency. Further investigations revealed that NF2-silenced cells supported reduced activity of the Nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 antioxidant transcription factor, concomitant with elevated expression of NADPH oxidase enzymes. Importantly, mammary-specific Nf2-/- in an Mouse mammary tumor virus Neu + murine breast cancer model demonstrated accelerated mammary carcinogenesis in vivo. Tumor-derived primary organoids and cell lines were characteristically invasive with evidence of a dysregulated cellular redox management system. As such, Merlin deficiency programmatically influences redox imbalance that orchestrates malignant attributes of mammary/breast cancer.                © 2021 The Authors.

33190042        	Rapid screening for individualized chemotherapy optimization of colorectal cancer: A novel conditional reprogramming technology-based functional diagnostic assay.            	In vitro patient tumor models such as patient-derived organoids (PDO) and conditionally reprogrammed (CR) cell culture are important for translational research and pre-clinical drug testing. In this study we present a personalized drug sensitivity test for late stage, potentially operable colorectal cancer (CRC) using patient-derived primary tumor cells isolated with i-CR technology, an optimized CR method. We explored the clinical feasibility of using i-CR platform to guide CRC chemotherapy, and established the correlation between in vitro drug sensitivity and patient clinical response.                Primary CRC tumor cells were isolated and cultured with the i-CR technology. NGS was performed and the WES and CNV results of i-CR cells were compared with that of the original patient tumor samples. In vitro drug screenings were done with guideline chemotherapy drugs for CRC. In vivo drug response was examined with paired PDX mouse models. A double-blind co-clinical cohort study was carried out and the clinical outcomes of the enrolled patients were compared with the i-CR results.                i-CR platform could be used to rapidly propagate primary colorectal tumor cells that represent individual patient tumors effectively by keeping the clonal heterogeneity and the genetic characteristics. Chemotherapy drug screenings with i-CR cells were comparable with that of PDX models. More importantly, i-CR results showed high accordance with the clinical outcomes of the enrolled CRC patients.                i-CR platform was capable to test and optimize therapeutic regimens pre-clinically, study cancer cell biology, and model tumor re-emergence to identify new targeted therapeutics from an effective personalized medicine standpoint.

33007300        	Mesenchymal Plasticity Regulated by Prrx1 Drives Aggressive Pancreatic Cancer Biology.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a fibroblast-rich desmoplastic stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to display a high degree of interconvertible states including quiescent, inflammatory, and myofibroblastic phenotypes; however, the mechanisms by which this plasticity is achieved are poorly understood. Here, we aim to elucidate the role of CAF plasticity and its impact on PDAC biology.                To investigate the role of mesenchymal plasticity in PDAC progression, we generated a PDAC mouse model in which CAF plasticity is modulated by genetic depletion of the transcription factor Prrx1. Primary pancreatic fibroblasts from this mouse model were further characterized by functional in vitro assays. To characterize the impact of CAFs on tumor differentiation and response to chemotherapy, various coculture experiments were performed. In vivo, tumors were characterized by morphology, extracellular matrix composition, and tumor dissemination and metastasis.                Our in vivo findings showed that Prrx1-deficient CAFs remain constitutively activated. Importantly, this CAF phenotype determines tumor differentiation and disrupts systemic tumor dissemination. Mechanistically, coculture experiments of tumor organoids and CAFs showed that CAFs shape the epithelial-to-mesenchymal phenotype and confer gemcitabine resistance of PDAC cells induced by CAF-derived hepatocyte growth factor. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that patients with pancreatic cancer with high stromal expression of Prrx1 display the squamous, most aggressive, subtype of PDAC.                Here, we define that the Prrx1 transcription factor is critical for tuning CAF activation, allowing a dynamic switch between a dormant and an activated state. This work shows that Prrx1-mediated CAF plasticity has significant impact on PDAC biology and therapeutic resistance.                Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

32888433        	FOXA1 Mutations Reveal Distinct Chromatin Profiles and Influence Therapeutic Response in Breast Cancer.            	Mutations in the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1 are a hallmark of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers. Examining FOXA1 in ∼5,000 breast cancer patients identifies several hotspot mutations in the Wing2 region and a breast cancer-specific mutation SY242CS, located in the third β strand. Using a clinico-genomically curated cohort, together with breast cancer models, we find that FOXA1 mutations associate with a lower response to aromatase inhibitors. Mechanistically, Wing2 mutations display increased chromatin binding at ER loci upon estrogen stimulation, and an enhanced ER-mediated transcription without changes in chromatin accessibility. In contrast, SY242CS shows neomorphic properties that include the ability to open distinct chromatin regions and activate an alternative cistrome and transcriptome. Structural modeling predicts that SY242CS confers a conformational change that mediates stable binding to a non-canonical DNA motif. Taken together, our results provide insights into how FOXA1 mutations perturb its function to dictate cancer progression and therapeutic response.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

33129865        	BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated breast cancer and the roles of current modelling systems in drug discovery.            	For a drug candidate to be fully developed takes years and investment of hundreds of millions of dollars. There is no doubt that drug development is difficult and risky, but vital to protecting against devastating disease. This difficulty is clearly evident in BRCA1 and BRCA2 related breast cancer, with current treatment options largely confined to invasive surgical procedures, as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimes which damage healthy tissue and can leave remnant disease. Consequently, patient survival and relapse rates are far from ideal, and new candidate treatments are needed. The preclinical stages of drug discovery are crucial to get right for translation to hospital beds. Disease models must take advantage of current technologies and be accurate for rapid and translatable treatments. Careful selection of cell lines must be coupled with high throughput techniques, with promising results trialled further in highly accurate humanised patient derived xenograft models. Traditional adherent drug screening should transition to 3D culture systems amenable to high throughput techniques if the gap between in vitro and in vivo studies is to be partially bridged. The possibility of organoid, induced pluripotent stem cell, and conditionally reprogrammed in vitro models is tantalising, however protocols are yet to be fully established. This review of BRCA1 and BRCA2 cancer biology and current modelling systems will hopefully guide the design of future drug discovery endeavours and highlight areas requiring improvement.

32251410        	Discovery of a selective inhibitor of doublecortin like kinase 1.            	Doublecortin like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is an understudied kinase that is upregulated in a wide range of cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, little is known about its potential as a therapeutic target. We used chemoproteomic profiling and structure-based design to develop a selective, in vivo-compatible chemical probe of the DCLK1 kinase domain, DCLK1-IN-1. We demonstrate activity of DCLK1-IN-1 against clinically relevant patient-derived PDAC organoid models and use a combination of RNA-sequencing, proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis to reveal that DCLK1 inhibition modulates proteins and pathways associated with cell motility in this context. DCLK1-IN-1 will serve as a versatile tool to investigate DCLK1 biology and establish its role in cancer.	
28450230        	Metastatic Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma of the Spinal Cord: A Case Report and Review of Literature.            	Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, malignant soft-tissue neoplasm typically seen in young adults that possesses an unusual tendency to metastasize. Metastases to the intramedullary compartment of the spinal cord, however, are exceptionally rare and have not been described in the literature.                We report the case of a 23-year-old woman with disseminated ASPS to the lung and brain who presented with progressive lower-extremity weakness and loss of sensation after radiation and chemotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 1.3-cm avidly enhancing lesion within the central thoracic spinal cord at T3. A T2-T4 laminectomy was undertaken and resulted in a gross total resection. Histopathologically, the mass was composed of organoid nests containing epithelioid cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm separated by sinusoidal spaces. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated convincing positive TFE3 staining. Postoperative imaging confirmed the complete resection of the mass, and her examination was notable for intact sensation and impaired motor function that gradually improved.                A review of the literature found that the reported case represents the first instance of primary or metastatic ASPS in the spinal cord. Metastatic ASPS should thus be included in the differential diagnosis in patients with known disease and neurologic impairment or back pain. Imaging of the spine should then be considered.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
32665854        	Culture and application of conditionally reprogrammed primary tumor cells.            	Cancer is still a major public-health problem that threatens human life worldwide and further study needs to be carried out in the basic and preclinical areas. Although high-throughput sequencing technology and individualized precise therapy have made breakthroughs over the years, the high failure rate of clinical translational research has limited the innovation of antitumor drugs and triggered the urgent need for optimal cancer-research models. The development of cancerous cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, and organoid has strongly promoted the development of tumor-biology research, but the prediction values are limited. Conditional reprogramming (CR) is a novel cell-culture method for cancer research combining feeder cells with a Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, which enables the rapid and continuous proliferation of primary epithelial cells. In this review, we summarize the methodology to establish CR model and overview recent functions and applications of CR cell-culture models in cancer research with regard to the study of cancer-biology characterization, the exploration of therapeutic targets, individualized drug screening, the illumination of mechanisms about response to antitumor drugs, and the improvement of patient-derived animal models, and finally discuss in detail the major limitations of this cell-culture system.                © The Author(s) 2020.

32770107        	PIAS1 and TIF1γ collaborate to promote SnoN SUMOylation and suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.            	SUMO E3 ligases specify protein substrates for SUMOylation. The SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and TIF1γ target the transcriptional regulator SnoN for SUMOylation leading to suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Whether and how TIF1γ and PIAS1 might coordinate SnoN SUMOylation and regulation of EMT remained unknown. Here, we reveal that SnoN associates simultaneously with both TIF1γ and PIAS1, leading to a trimeric protein complex. Hence, PIAS1 and TIF1γ collaborate to promote the SUMOylation of SnoN. Importantly, loss of function studies of PIAS1 and TIF1γ suggest that these E3 ligases act in an interdependent manner to suppress EMT of breast cell-derived tissue organoids. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel mechanism by which SUMO E3 ligases coordinate substrate SUMOylation with biological implications.	
33179852        	Human soluble ACE2 improves the effect of remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2 infection.            	There is a critical need for safe and effective drugs for COVID-19. Only remdesivir has received authorization for COVID-19 and has been shown to improve outcomes but not decrease mortality. However, the dose of remdesivir is limited by hepatic and kidney toxicity. ACE2 is the critical cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated additive effect of combination therapy using remdesivir with recombinant soluble ACE2 (high/low dose) on Vero E6 and kidney organoids, targeting two different modalities of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle: cell entry via its receptor ACE2 and intracellular viral RNA replication. This combination treatment markedly improved their therapeutic windows against SARS-CoV-2 in both models. By using single amino-acid resolution screening in haploid ES cells, we report a singular critical pathway required for remdesivir toxicity, namely, Adenylate Kinase 2. The data provided here demonstrate that combining two therapeutic modalities with different targets, common strategy in HIV treatment, exhibit strong additive effects at sub-toxic concentrations. Our data lay the groundwork for the study of combinatorial regimens in future COVID-19 clinical trials.                © 2020 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.	
31148594        	Trp53 null and R270H mutant alleles have comparable effects in regulating invasion, metastasis, and gene expression in mouse colon tumorigenesis.            	Somatic APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), TP53, KRAS mutations are present in roughly 80%, 60%, and 40%, respectively, of human colorectal cancers (CRCs). Most TP53 mutant alleles in CRCs encode missense mutant proteins with loss-of-function (LOF) of p53's transcriptional activity and dominant negative (DN) effects on wild-type p53 function. Missense mutant p53 proteins have been reported to exert gain-of-function (GOF) effects in cancer. We compared the phenotypic effects of the common human cancer-associated TP53 R273H missense mutation to p53 null status in a genetically engineered mouse CRC model. Inactivation of one allele of Apc together with activation of a Kras mutant allele in mouse colon epithelium instigated development of serrated and hyperplastic epithelium and adenomas (AK mice). Addition of a Trp53R270H or Trp53null mutant allele to the model (AKP mice) led to markedly shortened survival and increased tumor burden relative to that of AK mice, including adenocarcinomas in AKP mice. Comparable life span and tumor burden were seen in AKP mice carrying Trp53R270H or Trp53null alleles, along with similar frequencies of spontaneous metastasis to lymph nodes, lung, and liver. The fraction of adenocarcinomas with submucosa or deeper invasion was higher in AKP270/fl mice than in AKPfl/fl mice, but the incidence of adenocarcinomas per mouse did not differ significantly between AKPfl/fl and AKP270/fl mice. In line with their comparable biological behaviors, mouse primary tumors and tumor-derived organoids with the Trp53R270H or Trp53null alleles had highly similar gene expression profiles. Human CRCs with TP53 R273 missense mutant or null alleles also had essentially homogeneous gene expression patterns. Our findings indicate the R270H/R273H p53 mutant protein does not manifest definite GOF biological effects in mouse and human CRCs, suggesting possible GOF effects of mutant p53 in cancer phenotypes are likely allele-specific and/or context-dependent.	
25259521        	In-vivo fusion of human cancer and hamster stromal cells permanently transduces and transcribes human DNA.            	After demonstrating, with karyotyping, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization, the retention of certain human chromosomes and genes following the spontaneous fusion of human tumor and hamster cells in-vivo, it was postulated that cell fusion causes the horizontal transmission of malignancy and donor genes. Here, we analyzed gene expression profiles of 3 different hybrid tumors first generated in the hamster cheek pouch after human tumor grafting, and then propagated in hamsters and in cell cultures for years: two Hodgkin lymphomas (GW-532, GW-584) and a glioblastoma multiforme (GB-749). Based on the criteria of MAS 5.0 detection P-values ≤0.065 and at least a 2-fold greater signal expression value than a hamster melanoma control, we identified 3,759 probe sets (ranging from 1,040 to 1,303 in each transplant) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of the 3 hybrid tumors, which unambiguously mapped to 3,107 unique Entrez Gene IDs, representative of all human chromosomes; however, by karyology, one of the hybrid tumors (GB-749) had a total of 15 human chromosomes in its cells. Among the genes mapped, 39 probe sets, representing 33 unique Entrez Gene IDs, complied with the detection criteria in all hybrid tumor samples. Five of these 33 genes encode transcription factors that are known to regulate cell growth and differentiation; five encode cell adhesion- and transmigration-associated proteins that participate in oncogenesis and/or metastasis and invasion; and additional genes encode proteins involved in signaling pathways, regulation of apoptosis, DNA repair, and multidrug resistance. These findings were corroborated by PCR and reverse transcription PCR, showing the presence of human alphoid (α)-satellite DNA and the F11R transcripts in additional tumor transplant generations. We posit that in-vivo fusion discloses genes implicated in tumor progression, and gene families coding for the organoid phenotype. Thus, cancer cells can transduce adjacent stromal cells, with the resulting progeny having permanently transcribed genes with malignant and other gene functions of the donor DNA. Using heterospecific in-vivo cell fusion, genes encoding oncogenic and organogenic traits may be identified.	
31659152        	Truncated PPM1D impairs stem cell response to genotoxic stress and promotes growth of APC-deficient tumors in the mouse colon.            	Protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1 delta (PPM1D) terminates cell response to genotoxic stress by negatively regulating the tumor suppressor p53 and other targets at chromatin. Mutations in the exon 6 of the PPM1D result in production of a highly stable, C-terminally truncated PPM1D. These gain-of-function PPM1D mutations are present in various human cancers but their role in tumorigenesis remains unresolved. Here we show that truncated PPM1D impairs activation of the cell cycle checkpoints in human non-transformed RPE cells and allows proliferation in the presence of DNA damage. Next, we developed a mouse model by introducing a truncating mutation in the PPM1D locus and tested contribution of the oncogenic PPM1DT allele to colon tumorigenesis. We found that p53 pathway was suppressed in colon stem cells harboring PPM1DT resulting in proliferation advantage under genotoxic stress condition. In addition, truncated PPM1D promoted tumor growth in the colon in Apcmin mice and diminished survival. Moreover, tumor organoids derived from colon of the ApcminPpm1dT/+ mice were less sensitive to 5-fluorouracil when compared to ApcminPpm1d+/+and the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil was restored by inhibition of PPM1D. Finally, we screened colorectal cancer patients and identified recurrent somatic PPM1D mutations in a fraction of colon adenocarcinomas that are p53 proficient and show defects in mismatch DNA repair. In summary, we provide the first in vivo evidence that truncated PPM1D can promote tumor growth and modulate sensitivity to chemotherapy.	
31618602        	BMP Signaling in Development, Stem Cells, and Diseases of the Gastrointestinal Tract.            	The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway is essential for the morphogenesis of multiple organs in the digestive system. Abnormal BMP signaling has also been associated with disease initiation and progression in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and associated organs. Recent studies using animal models, tissue organoids, and human pluripotent stem cells have significantly expanded our understanding of the roles played by BMPs in the development and homeostasis of GI organs. It is clear that BMP signaling regulates GI function and disease progression that involve stem/progenitor cells and inflammation in a tissue-specific manner. In this review we discuss these new findings with a focus on the esophagus, stomach, and intestine.	
26138071        	Role of epithelial cells in the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.            	In the past decades, continuous effort has been paid to deeply understanding the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. As the disease typically arises as chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, research has been focused on how such an uncontrolled, deleterious immune response may arise and persist in a certain cohort of patients. Based on those immunologic analyses, the establishment of anti-TNF-α therapy, and the following series of biologic agents achieved great success and dramatically changed the therapeutic strategy of IBD patients. However, to guarantee long-term remission of the disease, the therapeutic standard has been raised to achieve "mucosal healing", which requires complete repair of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Recent studies have revealed the unexpected importance of epithelial cells in the pathophysiology of IBD. The general barrier function as well as the cell lineage-specific functions have been deeply attributed to the development of chronic intestinal inflammation. Also, the groundbreaking establishment of the in vitro intestinal stem cell culture system has opened up a way of developing stem cell transplantation therapy to treat otherwise refractory ulcers that may persist in IBD patients. In this review, we would like to focus on the role of epithelial cells in the pathophysiology of IBD, and also give a perspective to the upcoming development of regenerative therapies that may become one of the therapeutic choices to achieve mucosal healing in refractory patients of IBD.	
21389986        	Hedgehog/Wnt feedback supports regenerative proliferation of epithelial stem cells in bladder.            	Epithelial integrity in metazoan organs is maintained through the regulated proliferation and differentiation of organ-specific stem and progenitor cells. Although the epithelia of organs such as the intestine regenerate constantly and thus remain continuously proliferative, other organs, such as the mammalian urinary bladder, shift from near-quiescence to a highly proliferative state in response to epithelial injury. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this injury-induced mode of regenerative response are poorly defined. Here we show in mice that the proliferative response to bacterial infection or chemical injury within the bladder is regulated by signal feedback between basal cells of the urothelium and the stromal cells that underlie them. We demonstrate that these basal cells include stem cells capable of regenerating all cell types within the urothelium, and are marked by expression of the secreted protein signal Sonic hedgehog (Shh). On injury, Shh expression in these basal cells increases and elicits increased stromal expression of Wnt protein signals, which in turn stimulate the proliferation of both urothelial and stromal cells. The heightened activity of this signal feedback circuit and the associated increase in cell proliferation appear to be required for restoration of urothelial function and, in the case of bacterial injury, may help clear and prevent further spread of infection. Our findings provide a conceptual framework for injury-induced epithelial regeneration in endodermal organs, and may provide a basis for understanding the roles of signalling pathways in cancer growth and metastasis.                ©2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

23010075        	Basal but not luminal mammary epithelial cells require PI3K/mTOR signaling for Ras-driven overgrowth.            	The mammary ducts of humans and mice are comprised of two main mammary epithelial cell (MEC) subtypes: a surrounding layer of basal MECs and an inner layer of luminal MECs. Breast cancer subtypes show divergent clinical behavior that may reflect properties inherent in their MEC compartment of origin. How the response to a cancer-initiating genetic event is shaped by MEC subtype remains largely unexplored. Using the mouse mammary gland, we designed organotypic three-dimensional culture models that permit challenge of discrete MEC compartments with the same oncogenic insult. Mammary organoids were prepared from mice engineered for compartment-restricted coexpression of oncogenic H-RAS(G12V) together with a nuclear fluorescent reporter. Monitoring of H-RAS(G12V)-expressing MECs during extended live cell imaging permitted visualization of Ras-driven phenotypes via video microscopy. Challenging either basal or luminal MECs with H-RAS(G12V) drove MEC proliferation and survival, culminating in aberrant organoid overgrowth. In each compartment, Ras activation triggered modes of collective MEC migration and invasion that contrasted with physiologic modes used during growth factor-initiated branching morphogenesis. Although basal and luminal Ras activation produced similar overgrowth phenotypes, inhibitor studies revealed divergent use of Ras effector pathways. Blocking either the phosphoinositide 3-kinase or the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway completely suppressed Ras-driven invasion and overgrowth of basal MECs, but only modestly attenuated Ras-driven phenotypes in luminal MECs. We show that MEC subtype defines signaling pathway dependencies downstream of Ras. Thus, cells-of-origin may critically determine the drug sensitivity profiles of mammary neoplasia.                ©2012 AACR.	
32487192        	PKM2 inhibition may reverse therapeutic resistance to transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma.            	Therapeutic options for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an interventional procedure used to deliver chemotherapy and embolizing agents directly to the tumor and is the procedure of choice for patients with intermediate stage HCC. While effective, more than 40% of patients do not respond to therapy, highlighting the need to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance. We sought to evaluate mechanisms of TACE resistance and evaluate a potential therapeutic target to overcome this resistance.                Using a prognostic gene signature which predicts TACE response (TACE Navigator) in a cohort of HCC patients who received TACE, patients were classified as responders and non-responders. Transcriptomic and gene pathway analysis were used to identify potential drivers of TACE resistance. Knockdown of the gene encoding rate limiting enzyme PKM2 using shRNA in HCC cell lines, as well as pharmacologic inhibition of PKM2 with shikonin using an in vitro TACE model measured response to chemotherapy under hypoxia. Finally, we replicated the TACE model with shikonin using patient derived cell line organoids (PDC). Functional studies were performed in vitro using immunoblotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, glycolysis and hypoxia assays.                In patient non-responders, we identified enrichment of the glycolysis pathway, specifically of the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme PKM2. We identified four HCC cell lines which recapitulated a TACE responder-like and non-responder-like phenotype. PKM2 knockdown in HCC cell lines demonstrated a less proliferative and aggressive phenotype as well as improved drug sensitivity to both doxorubicin and cisplatin. In vitro TACE model demonstrated that TACE non-responder-like cells overcame therapeutic resistance and rendered them susceptible to therapy through PKM2 knockdown. Lastly, we obtained similar results using a pharmacologic PKM2 inhibitor, shikonin in both cell lines, and PDC organoids.                Elevated PKM2 is associated with treatment resistance and abbreviated survival in patients receiving TACE. Elevated PKM2 in vitro is associated with increased utilization of the glycolysis pathway, resulting in oxygen independent cell metabolism. Through PKM2 knockdown as well as with pharmacologic inhibition with shikonin, non-responder cells can be reprogrammed to act as responders and could improve TACE efficacy in patients.	
24827588        	Hepatic uterus-like mass misdiagnosed as hepatic abscess.            	Hepatic endometriosis/uterus-like mass is rare and may be overlooked during hepatic cyst workups. We report a case of uterus-like mass, misdiagnosed as hepatic abscess.                A 47-year-old woman developed abdominal pain and vomiting. Infectious colitis with hepatic abscess was diagnosed, and remained antibiotic-refractory. Fine-needle aspiration and core biopsies showed benign contents. The patient presented to our institution with symptoms and normal blood work. Laparoscopic excision demonstrated a 1.4-cm cyst composed of endometrial glands (estrogen receptor+ and progesterone receptor+) and stroma (CD10+) with smooth muscle actin (SMA+), arranged in an organoid fashion. The patient, status-post hysterectomy, had no history or symptoms of endometriosis.                This rare case illustrates the merit of considering uterus-like mass/endometriosis in the differential diagnosis of antibiotic-refractory hepatic cysts. Cyst heterogeneity may confound needle biopsy. We report the first instance of a hepatic uterus-like mass, with a review of related entities, postulated histogenesis, and important clinical associations.                © The Author(s) 2014.	
32811644        	Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the regenerative potential of thyroid follicular epithelial cells in metastatic thyroid carcinoma.            	Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency is the cornerstone of treatment for metastatic thyroid cancer. Due to the loss of follicular epithelial cells in thyroid cancer, the thyroid gland degenerates to 85% of its original size. When thyroid stimulating hormone is restored, follicular epithelial cells in thyroid cancer regenerate, which is postulated to be related to stem-like cells. By single cell RNA seq, we found a group of rare thyroid follicular epithelial cells in mouse metastatic thyroid cancer, which expressed stem-like genes (CD44V6+ and CD133+) and a large number of differentiated cells (CD44V6+ and CD24+). In mouse and in organoids, the two subsets contribute equally to metastatic thyroid cancer regeneration. The analysis of human metastatic thyroid cancer revealed that the differentiated thyroid follicular epithelial cell subpopulation was similar to that of the stem like epithelial cell subpopulation, and the regeneration potential was also enhanced after thyroid stimulating hormone ablation. Accordingly, we propose that the regeneration of metastatic thyroid cancer is driven by almost all persistent thyroid follicular epithelial cells, not only by few stem-like cells.

27803115        	Alterations in the epithelial stem cell compartment could contribute to permanent changes in the mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.            	UC is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa. Growing evidence supports a role for epithelial cell defects in driving pathology. Moreover, long-lasting changes in the epithelial barrier have been reported in quiescent UC. Our aim was to investigate whether epithelial cell defects could originate from changes in the epithelial compartment imprinted by the disease.                Epithelial organoid cultures (EpOCs) were expanded ex vivo from the intestinal crypts of non-IBD controls and patients with UC. EpOCs were induced to differentiate (d-EpOCs), and the total RNA was extracted for microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses. Whole intestinal samples were used to determine mRNA expression by qPCR, or protein localisation by immunostaining.                EpOCs from patients with UC maintained self-renewal potential and the capability to give rise to differentiated epithelial cell lineages comparable with control EpOCs. Nonetheless, a group of genes was differentially regulated in the EpOCs and d-EpOCs of patients with UC, including genes associated with antimicrobial defence (ie, LYZ, PLA2G2A), with secretory (ie, ZG16, CLCA1) and absorptive (ie, AQP8, MUC12) functions, and with a gastric phenotype (ie, ANXA10, CLDN18 and LYZ). A high rate of concordance was found in the expression profiles of the organoid cultures and whole colonic tissues from patients with UC.                Permanent changes in the colonic epithelium of patients with UC could be promoted by alterations imprinted in the stem cell compartment. These changes may contribute to perpetuation of the disease.                Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

32268614        	Targeting the Acidic Tumor Microenvironment: Unexpected Pro-Neoplastic Effects of Oral NaHCO3 Therapy in Murine Breast Tissue.            	The acidic tumor microenvironment modifies malignant cell behavior. Here, we study consequences of the microenvironment in breast carcinomas. Beginning at carcinogen-based breast cancer induction, we supply either regular or NaHCO3-containing drinking water to female C57BL/6j mice. We evaluate urine and blood acid-base status, tumor metabolism (microdialysis sampling), and tumor pH (pH-sensitive microelectrodes) in vivo. Based on freshly isolated epithelial organoids from breast carcinomas and normal breast tissue, we assess protein expression (immunoblotting, mass spectrometry), intracellular pH (fluorescence microscopy), and cell proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation). Oral NaHCO3 therapy increases breast tumor pH in vivo from 6.68 ± 0.04 to 7.04 ± 0.09 and intracellular pH in breast epithelial organoids by ~0.15. Breast tumors develop with median latency of 85.5 ± 8.2 days in NaHCO3-treated mice vs. 82 ± 7.5 days in control mice. Oral NaHCO3 therapy does not affect tumor growth, histopathology or glycolytic metabolism. The capacity for cellular net acid extrusion is increased in NaHCO3-treated mice and correlates negatively with breast tumor latency. Oral NaHCO3 therapy elevates proliferative activity in organoids from breast carcinomas. Changes in protein expression patterns-observed by high-throughput proteomics analyses-between cancer and normal breast tissue and in response to oral NaHCO3 therapy reveal complex influences on metabolism, cytoskeleton, cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction, and cell signaling pathways. We conclude that oral NaHCO3 therapy neutralizes the microenvironment of breast carcinomas, elevates the cellular net acid extrusion capacity, and accelerates proliferation without net effect on breast cancer development or tumor growth. We demonstrate unexpected pro-neoplastic consequences of oral NaHCO3 therapy that in breast tissue cancel out previously reported anti-neoplastic effects.	
22718848        	Mucosal large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the head and neck regions in Japanese patients: a distinct clinicopathological entity.            	Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is well-known as a lung cancer subtype. This study assessed the prevalence of head and neck mucosal LCNEC (M-LCNEC).                M-LCNEC was studied clinically, histologically and immunohistochemically.                Of 814 surgically resected cases of mucosal head and neck carcinoma, only eight cases (0.98%; all men, mean age 64.6 years) were rediagnosed as M-LCNEC. They occurred in the oropharynx (n=3), larynx (n=4) and hypopharynx (n=1). Seven of the cases had regional lymph node metastases and four resulted in death. Histologically, M-LCNEC had a sheet-like trabacular organoid growth pattern of relatively large basaloid cells in which central necrosis, rosette formation, peripheral palisading and high mitotic figures were evident. M-LCNEC was immunopositive for two or three neuroendocrine markers (CD56, chromogranin-A and synaptophysin). All cases showed high proliferative activity.                M-LCNEC in the head and neck regions is a distinct histopathological entity whose positivity for neuroendocrine markers makes its diagnosis important. As about half of the patients died of the disease, M-LCNEC has a relatively poor prognosis.	
33582842        	Context-dependent roles of YAP/TAZ in stem cell fates and cancer.            	Hippo effectors YAP and TAZ control cell fate and survival through various mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation of key genes. However, much of this research has been marked by conflicting results, as well as controversy over whether YAP and TAZ are redundant. A substantial portion of the discordance stems from their contradictory roles in stem cell self-renewal vs. differentiation and cancer cell survival vs. apoptosis. In this review, we present an overview of the multiple context-dependent functions of YAP and TAZ in regulating cell fate decisions in stem cells and organoids, as well as their mechanisms of controlling programmed cell death pathways in cancer.	
27765265        	On the shoulders of Hubrecht: From embryos to stem cells.            	One hundred years of the Hubrecht Institute were celebrated in May 2016 with the organization of a one-day symposium "From embryos to stem cells" on the Uithof Campus, Utrecht, the Netherlands. Nine distinguished speakers were invited. They all represent a research branch originating from the passion of Institute founder, Ambrosius Hubrecht, for embryology:, regulation of gene expression, genome structure and function, embryonic and adult stem cells, nuclear reprogramming, and understanding cancer and other diseases using model organisms. The centennial symposium not only retraced the history of the Institute and of modern developmental biology, but was also a tribute to basic research. From there, avenues to therapeutics are being developed and implemented. The symposium was organized, introduced and chaired by Jeroen den Hertog and Alexander van Oudenaarden, the present Directors of the Institute, who also stand on Hubrecht's shoulders.

30659851        	Modeling malignancies using induced pluripotent stem cells: from chronic myeloid leukemia to hereditary cancers.            	Over the last decade, the possibility of reprogramming malignant cells to a pluripotent state has been achieved in several hematological malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndromes, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It has been shown that it is readily possible to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from several types of primary CML cells and to generate progenitors and differentiated cells with variable efficiency. Although these experiments have brought some new insights in the understanding of CML pathophysiology, the ultimate goal of generating induced leukemic stem cells (LSCs) with long-term multilineage potential has not yet been demonstrated. Experiments under way will determine whether additional signaling events are required to induce the emergence of bona fide LSCs. However, iPSC modeling offers the unique possibility to generate pluripotent cells harboring cancer-predisposing mutations using patient-derived noncancerous cells, as has been shown in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, BRCA-1 associated breast carcinomas, or RET-mutated medullary thyroid carcinomas. In these conditions, mutated iPSCs can then be used to study the mutational history that precedes the appearance of the malignant transformation and to develop novel drug-screening strategies. The ability to induce a successful differentiation program toward the tissue in which a given cancer develops or to generate tissue-specific cancer organoids in which the full oncogenic potential can be revealed remains a major challenge in the field. Similarly, in hematological malignancies, a significant hurdle remains due to the lack of adequate technology to induce the emergence of leukemic cells that resemble LSCs, which hinders our ability to study the mechanisms of therapy resistance.

28663873        	Autofluorescence imaging captures heterogeneous drug response differences between 2D and 3D breast cancer cultures.            	Two-photon microscopy of cellular autofluorescence intensity and lifetime (optical metabolic imaging, or OMI) is a promising tool for preclinical drug development. OMI, which exploits the endogenous fluorescence from the metabolic coenzymes NAD(P)H and FAD, is sensitive to changes in cell metabolism produced by drug treatment. Previous studies have shown that drug response, genetic expression, cell-cell communication, and cell signaling in 3D culture match those of the original in vivo tumor, but not those of 2D culture. The goal of this study is to use OMI to quantify dynamic cell-level metabolic differences in drug response in 2D cell lines vs. 3D organoids generated from xenograft tumors of the same cell origin. BT474 cells and Herceptin-resistant BT474 (HR6) cells were tested. Cells were treated with vehicle control, Herceptin, XL147 (PI3K inhibitor), and the combination. The OMI index was used to quantify response, and is a linear combination of the redox ratio (intensity of NAD(P)H divided by FAD), mean NADH lifetime, and mean FAD lifetime. The results confirm that the OMI index resolves significant differences (p<0.05) in drug response for 2D vs. 3D cultures, specifically for BT474 cells 24 hours after Herceptin treatment, for HR6 cells 24 and 72 hours after combination treatment, and for HR6 cells 72 hours after XL147 treatment. Cell-level analysis of the OMI index also reveals differences in the number of cell sub-populations in 2D vs. 3D culture at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-treatment in control and treated groups. Finally, significant increases (p<0.05) in the mean lifetime of NADH and FAD were measured in 2D vs. 3D for both cell lines at 72 hours post-treatment in control and all treatment groups. These whole-population differences in the mean NADH and FAD lifetimes are supported by differences in the number of cell sub-populations in 2D vs. 3D. Overall, these studies confirm that OMI is sensitive to differences in drug response in 2D vs. 3D, and provides further information on dynamic changes in the relative abundance of metabolic cell sub-populations that contribute to this difference.	
28736348        	Pathologic Progression, Possible Origin, and Management of Multiple Primary Intracranial Neuroendocrine Carcinomas.            	Primary intracranial neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are extremely rare malignant tumors with no previous reports of multiple ones in the literatures.                The clinical presentation, preoperative and reexamined magnetic resonance imaging findings, as well as histopathologic studies of a 56-year-old female subject with multiple intracranial NECs mimicking multiple intracranial meningiomas, who underwent 3 operations with left parietal craniotomy, right occipital parietal craniotomy, and left frontal craniotomy, separately and chronologically, are presented in this article. Noteworthy, the first and second tumors were confirmed as NECs exhibiting histologic characteristics of typical anaplastic meningiomas with features of whorl formation, while the third tumor was a typical NEC with features of organoid cancer nests. In other words, the first 2 lesions were diagnosed as meningioma as opposed to NEC. It was only after the third surgery that the pathology for the first 2 cases was reviewed and had a revised diagnosis. After the third surgical resection, the patient further received whole brain radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy (temozolomide combined with YH-16). At her 10-month follow-up, the patient achieved a good outcome.                Multiple primary intracranial NECs are extremely rare. The tumor might be of arachnoidal or leptomeningeal origin, with histologic patterns that might lead to transformation and/or progression. Maximal surgical resection is warranted for symptomatic mass effect. Postoperative adjuvant treatments including radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be a recommended therapeutic modality.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
32929562        	Current methods in translational cancer research.            	Recent developments in pre-clinical screening tools, that more reliably predict the clinical effects and adverse events of candidate therapeutic agents, has ushered in a new era of drug development and screening. However, given the rapid pace with which these models have emerged, the individual merits of these translational research tools warrant careful evaluation in order to furnish clinical researchers with appropriate information to conduct pre-clinical screening in an accelerated and rational manner. This review assesses the predictive utility of both well-established and emerging pre-clinical methods in terms of their suitability as a screening platform for treatment response, ability to represent pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug properties, and lastly debates the translational limitations and benefits of these models. To this end, we will describe the current literature on cell culture, organoids, in vivo mouse models, and in silico computational approaches. Particular focus will be devoted to discussing gaps and unmet needs in the literature as well as current advancements and innovations achieved in the field, such as co-clinical trials and future avenues for refinement.

Salivary gland tumors are neoplasms affecting the major and minor salivary glands of the oral cavity. Their complex pathological appearance and overlapping morphological features between subtypes, pose major challenges in the identification, classification, and staging of the tumor. Recently developed techniques of three-dimensional culture and organotypic modelling provide useful platforms for the clinical and biological characterization of these malignancies. Additionally, new advances in genetic and molecular screenings allow precise diagnosis and monitoring of tumor progression. Finally, novel therapeutic tools with increased efficiency and accuracy are emerging. In this review, we summarize the most common salivary gland neoplasms and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art tools to model, diagnose, and treat salivary gland tumors.	
31669338        	Review of functional in vitro models of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in leukaemia research.            	Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia represents the most common paediatric malignancy. Although survival rates approach up to 90% in children, investigation of leukaemic infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) is essential due to the presence of ongoing fatal complications. Recent in vitro studies mostly employed models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as endothelial cells of the microvasculature represent the largest surface between the blood stream and the brain parenchyma. However, crossing the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) within the choroid plexus (CP) has been shown to be a general capability of leukaemic blasts. Hence, in vitro models of the BCSFB to study leukaemic transmigration may be of major importance to understand the development of CNS leukaemia. This review will summarise available in vitro models of the BCSFB employed to study the cellular interactions with leukaemic blasts during cancer cell transmigration into the brain compartment across primary or immortal/immortalised BCSFB cells. It will also provide an outlook on prospective improvements in BCSFB in vitro models by developing barrier-on-a-chip models and brain organoids.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

32678004        	Pluripotent stem cell differentiation as an emerging model to study human prostate development.            	Prostate development is a complex process, and knowledge about this process is increasingly required for both basic developmental biology studies and clinical prostate cancer research, as prostate tumorigenesis can be regarded as the restoration of development in the adult prostate. Using rodent animal models, scientists have revealed that the development of the prostate is mainly mediated by androgen receptor (AR) signaling and that some other signaling pathways also play indispensable roles. However, there are still many unknowns in human prostate biology, mainly due to the limited availability of proper fetal materials. Here, we first briefly review prostate development with a focus on the AR, WNT, and BMP signaling pathways is necessary for prostate budding/BMP signaling pathways. Based on the current progress in in vitro prostatic differentiation and organoid techniques, we propose human pluripotent stem cells as an emerging model to study human prostate development.	
30718927        	The landscape of selection in 551 esophageal adenocarcinomas defines genomic biomarkers for the clinic.            	Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a poor-prognosis cancer type with rapidly rising incidence. Understanding of the genetic events driving EAC development is limited, and there are few molecular biomarkers for prognostication or therapeutics. Using a cohort of 551 genomically characterized EACs with matched RNA sequencing data, we discovered 77 EAC driver genes and 21 noncoding driver elements. We identified a mean of 4.4 driver events per tumor, which were derived more commonly from mutations than copy number alterations, and compared the prevelence of these mutations to the exome-wide mutational excess calculated using non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratios (dN/dS). We observed mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence of events within and between several dysregulated EAC pathways, a result suggestive of strong functional relationships. Indicators of poor prognosis (SMAD4 and GATA4) were verified in independent cohorts with significant predictive value. Over 50% of EACs contained sensitizing events for CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, which were highly correlated with clinically relevant sensitivity in a panel of EAC cell lines and organoids.	
27939883        	Indispensable role of Notch ligand-dependent signaling in the proliferation and stem cell niche maintenance of APC-deficient intestinal tumors.            	Ligand-dependent activation of Notch signaling is required to maintain the stem-cell niche of normal intestinal epithelium. However, the precise role of Notch signaling in the maintenance of the intestinal tumor stem cell niche and the importance of the RBPJ-independent non-canonical pathway in intestinal tumors remains unknown. Here we show that Notch signaling was activated in LGR5+ve cells of APC-deficient mice intestinal tumors. Accordingly, Notch ligands, including Jag1, Dll1, and Dll4, were expressed in these tumors. In vitro studies using tumor-derived organoids confirmed the intrinsic Notch activity-dependent growth of tumor cells. Surprisingly, the targeted deletion of Jag1 but not RBPJ in LGR5+ve tumor-initiating cells resulted in the silencing of Hes1 expression, disruption of the tumor stem cell niche, and dramatic reduction in the proliferation activity of APC-deficient intestinal tumors in vivo. Thus, our results highlight the importance of ligand-dependent non-canonical Notch signaling in the proliferation and maintenance of the tumor stem cell niche in APC-deficient intestinal adenomas.

27146113        	High rates of chromosome missegregation suppress tumor progression but do not inhibit tumor initiation.            	Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome number that deviates from a multiple of the haploid, has been recognized as a common feature of cancers for >100 yr. Previously, we showed that the rate of chromosome missegregation/chromosomal instability (CIN) determines the effect of aneuploidy on tumors; whereas low rates of CIN are weakly tumor promoting, higher rates of CIN cause cell death and tumor suppression. However, whether high CIN inhibits tumor initiation or suppresses the growth and progression of already initiated tumors remained unclear. We tested this using the Apc(Min/+) mouse intestinal tumor model, in which effects on tumor initiation versus progression can be discriminated. Apc(Min/+) cells exhibit low CIN, and we generated high CIN by reducing expression of the kinesin-like mitotic motor protein CENP-E. CENP-E(+/-);Apc(Min/+) doubly heterozygous cells had higher rates of chromosome missegregation than singly heterozygous cells, resulting in increased cell death and a substantial reduction in tumor progression compared with Apc(Min/+) animals. Intestinal organoid studies confirmed that high CIN does not inhibit tumor cell initiation but does inhibit subsequent cell growth. These findings support the conclusion that increasing the rate of chromosome missegregation could serve as a successful chemotherapeutic strategy.                © 2016 Zasadil et al.

32507920        	Malignant teratoid tumor of the thyroid gland: an aggressive primitive multiphenotypic malignancy showing organotypical elements and frequent DICER1 alterations-is the term "thyroblastoma" more appropriate?            	Primary thyroid teratomas are exceedingly rare. Mature and immature variants recapitulate their gonadal counterparts (predilection for infants/children, triphasic germ layer differentiation, and favorable outcome). On the other hand, the so-called malignant teratomas affect predominantly adults and elderly, are highly aggressive, and, according to a few published cases, harbor DICER1 mutations. We describe three highly aggressive sporadic malignant teratoid thyroid tumors in 2 females (17 and 45 years) and one male (17 years). Histology showed triphasic neoplasms composed of solid nests of small primitive monomorphic cells embedded in a cellular stroma with primitive immature rhabdomyosarcoma-like (2) or pleomorphic sarcoma-like (1) phenotype. The third component was represented by TTF1+/PAX8+ primitive teratoid epithelial tubules reminiscent of primitive thyroid follicles and/or Wilms tumor, admixed with scattered respiratory- or enteric-type tubules, neuroepithelial rosettes, and fetal-type squamoid nests. Foci of cartilage were seen in two cases, but none contained mature organoid adult-type tissue or skin adnexa. SALL4 was expressed in the small cell (2) and stromal (1) component. Other germ cell markers were negative. Molecular testing revealed a known "hotspot" pathogenic DICER1 mutation in two cases. In addition, case 1 had a missense TP53 variant. This type of thyroid malignancy is distinct from genuine teratomas. The immunoprofile suggests primitive thyroid- or branchial cleft-like differentiation. Given that "blastoma" is a well-accepted terminology in the spectrum of DICER1-associated malignancies, the term "thyroblastoma" might be more convenient for these malignant teratoid tumors of the thyroid gland. Relationship of thyroblastoma to the DICER1 syndrome remains to be addressed.	
30831083        	Gastric Parietal Cell Physiology and Helicobacter pylori-Induced Disease.            	Acidification of the gastric lumen poses a barrier to transit of potentially pathogenic bacteria and enables activation of pepsin to complement nutrient proteolysis initiated by salivary proteases. Histamine-induced activation of the PKA signaling pathway in gastric corpus parietal cells causes insertion of proton pumps into their apical plasma membranes. Parietal cell secretion and homeostasis are regulated by signaling pathways that control cytoskeletal changes required for apical membrane remodeling and organelle and proton pump activities. Helicobacter pylori colonization of human gastric mucosa affects gastric epithelial cell plasticity and homeostasis, promoting epithelial progression to neoplasia. By intervening in proton pump expression, H pylori regulates the abundance and diversity of microbiota that populate the intestinal lumen. We review stimulation-secretion coupling and renewal mechanisms in parietal cells and the mechanisms by which H pylori toxins and effectors alter cell secretory pathways (constitutive and regulated) and organelles to establish and maintain their inter- and intracellular niches. Studies of bacterial toxins and their effector proteins have provided insights into parietal cell physiology and the mechanisms by which pathogens gain control of cell activities, increasing our understanding of gastrointestinal physiology, microbial infectious disease, and immunology.

32850690        	Human Microphysiological Models of Intestinal Tissue and Gut Microbiome.            	The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a complex system responsible for nutrient absorption, digestion, secretion, and elimination of waste products that also hosts immune surveillance, the intestinal microbiome, and interfaces with the nervous system. Traditional in vitro systems cannot harness the architectural and functional complexity of the GI tract. Recent advances in organoid engineering, microfluidic organs-on-a-chip technology, and microfabrication allows us to create better in vitro models of human organs/tissues. These micro-physiological systems could integrate the numerous cell types involved in GI development and physiology, including intestinal epithelium, endothelium (vascular), nerve cells, immune cells, and their interplay/cooperativity with the microbiome. In this review, we report recent progress in developing micro-physiological models of the GI systems. We also discuss how these models could be used to study normal intestinal physiology such as nutrient absorption, digestion, and secretion as well as GI infection, inflammation, cancer, and metabolism.

28878359        	Directed Differentiation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells into Fallopian Tube Epithelium.            	The fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) has been recognized as a site of origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). However, the absence of relevant in vitro human models that can recapitulate tissue-specific architecture has hindered our understanding of FTE transformation and initiation of HGSC. Here, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used to establish a novel 3-dimensional (3D) human FTE organoid in vitro model containing the relevant cell types of the human fallopian tube as well as a luminal architecture that closely reflects the organization of fallopian tissues in vivo. Modulation of Wnt and BMP signaling directed iPSC differentiation into Müllerian cells and subsequent use of pro-Müllerian growth factors promoted FTE precursors. The expression and localization of Müllerian markers verified correct cellular differentiation. An innovative 3D growth platform, which enabled the FTE organoid to self-organize into a convoluted luminal structure, permitted matured differentiation to a FTE lineage. This powerful human-derived FTE organoid model can be used to study the earliest stages of HGSC development and to identify novel and specific biomarkers of early fallopian tube epithelial cell transformation.	
24766278        	'Neuroendocrine' middle ear adenomas: consistent expression of the transcription factor ISL1 further supports their neuroendocrine derivation.            	Neuroendocrine middle ear adenoma (MEA) is a rare epithelial neoplasm of uncertain histogenesis that frequently shows neuroendocrine features. To date, <120 cases have been reported. The aims of the current study were to describe our experience with neuroendocrine MEA, to assess the frequency of specific neuroendocrine differentiation, and to test these lesions for transcription factors known to be expressed in a variety of other neuroendocrine tumours.                We investigated six cases of neuroendocrine MEA, and stained them, for the first time, for the transcription factors CDX2, TTF1, PAX8, and ISL1 (islet-1). The patients were four men and two women (mean age, 39 years; range, 27-53 years). Two of four patients with extended follow-up (4.5-22 years) experienced recurrence at 92 months, and at 9 and 22 years, respectively. One case extending into the external ear coexisted with cholesteatoma. Histological examination showed trabecular, solid, acinar, glandular, cribriform, organoid, nested, diffuse non-cohesive plasmacytoid and pseudoalveolar patterns in varying combinations. Immunohistochemistry showed consistent expression of vimentin (4/4), pancytokeratin (6/6), synaptophysin (6/6), CD56 (4/4), and ISL1 (6/6). A CK7 antibody stained scattered cells in two of five cases. The myoepithelial markers and transcription factors TTF1, CDX2 or PAX8 were not expressed in any of the cases.                Middle ear adenoma is an indolent, locally recurring, but generally non-metastasizing neoplasm with uniform expression of synaptophysin and ISL1, indicating true neuroendocrine differentiation. Because of its highly varied cellular and architectural appearance, MEA should be distinguished from tympanic paraganglioma and a variety of rare benign and malignant lesions at this site.                © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	
23752178        	Utility of a bacterial infection model to study epithelial-mesenchymal transition, mesenchymal-epithelial transition or tumorigenesis.            	DCLK1 and Lgr5 have recently been identified as markers of quiescent and cycling stem cells in the small intestinal crypts, respectively. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key development program that is often activated during cancer invasion and metastasis, and also imparts a self-renewal capability to disseminating cancer cells. Utilizing the Citrobacter rodentium (CR)-induced transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH) model, we observed a relative decrease in DCLK1 expression in the colonic crypts, with significant shift towards stromal staining at peak (12 days post infection) hyperplasia, whereas staining for Lgr5 and Msi-1 increased several fold. When hyperplasia was regressing (days 20-34), an expansion of DCLK1+ve cells in the CR-infected crypts compared with that seen in uninfected control was recorded. Purified colonic crypt cells exhibiting epigenetic modulation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), Wnt and Notch pathways on 12 or 34 days post infection formed monolayers in vitro, and underwent trans-differentiation into fibroblast-like cells that stained positive for vimentin, fibronectin and DCLK1. These cells when trypsinized and regrown in soft agar, formed colonospheres/organoids that developed into crypt-like structures (colonoids) in Matrigel and stained positive for DCLK1. Mice exhibiting 12 or 34 days of TMCH were given azoxymethane once for 8 h (Gp1) or weekly for 3 weeks (Gp2), and subjected to crypt isolation. Crypt cells from Gp1 animals formed monolayers as well as colonospheres in soft agar and nodules/tumors in nude mice. Crypt cells isolated from Gp2 animals failed to form the monolayers, but developed into colonospheres in soft agar and nodules/tumors in nude mice. Thus, both hyperplasia and increased presence of DCLK1+ve cells promote cellular transformation in response to a second hit. The TMCH model, therefore, provides an excellent template to study how alterations in intestinal stem cells promote trans-differentiation, crypt regeneration or colon carcinogenesis following bacterial infection.	
31575031        	iPSC-Derived Embryoid Bodies as Models of c-Met-Mutated Hereditary Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma.            	Hereditary cancers with cancer-predisposing mutations represent unique models of human oncogenesis, as a driving oncogenic event is present in germline. Currently, there are no satisfactory models to study these malignancies. We report the generation of IPSC from the somatic cells of a patient with hereditary c-met-mutated papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC). From these cells we have generated spontaneous aggregates organizing in structures which expressed kidney markers such as PODXL and Six2. These structures expressed PRCC markers both in vitro and in vivo in NSG mice. Gene-expression profiling showed striking molecular similarities with signatures found in a large cohort of PRCC tumor samples. This analysis, applied to primary cancers with and without c-met mutation, showed overexpression of the BHLHE40 and KDM4C only in the c-met-mutated PRCC tumors, as predicted by c-met-mutated embryoid bodies transcriptome. These data therefore represent the first proof of concept of "hereditary renal cancer in a dish" model using c-met-mutated iPSC-derived embryoid bodies, opening new perspectives for discovery of novel predictive progression markers and for drug-screening for future precision-medicine strategies.	
30578874        	Fibrostenotic eosinophilic esophagitis might reflect epithelial lysyl oxidase induction by fibroblast-derived TNF-α.            	Fibrosis and stricture are major comorbidities in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Lysyl oxidase (LOX), a collagen cross-linking enzyme, has not been investigated in the context of EoE.                We investigated regulation of epithelial LOX expression as a novel biomarker and functional effector of fibrostenotic disease conditions associated with EoE.                LOX expression was analyzed by using RNA-sequencing, PCR assays, and immunostaining in patients with EoE; cytokine-stimulated esophageal 3-dimensional organoids; and fibroblast-epithelial cell coculture, the latter coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting.                Gene ontology and pathway analyses linked TNF-α and LOX expression in patients with EoE, which was validated in independent sets of patients with fibrostenotic conditions. TNF-α-mediated epithelial LOX upregulation was recapitulated in 3-dimensional organoids and coculture experiments. We find that fibroblast-derived TNF-α stimulates epithelial LOX expression through activation of nuclear factor κB and TGF-β-mediated signaling. In patients receiver operating characteristic analyses suggested that LOX upregulation indicates disease complications and fibrostenotic conditions in patients with EoE.                There is a novel positive feedback mechanism in epithelial LOX induction through fibroblast-derived TNF-α secretion. Esophageal epithelial LOX might have a role in the development of fibrosis with substantial translational implications.

33247337        	Potential impact of tissue molecular heterogeneity on ambient mass spectrometry profiles: a note of caution in choosing the right disease model.            	This review provides a summary of known molecular alterations in commonly used cancer models and strives to stipulate how they may affect ambient mass spectrometry profiles. Immortalized cell lines are known to accumulate mutations, and xenografts derived from cell lines are known to contain tumour microenvironment elements from the host animal. While the use of human specimens for mass spectrometry profiling studies is highly encouraged, patient-derived xenografts with low passage numbers could provide an alternative means of amplifying material for ambient MS research when needed. Similarly, genetic preservation of patient tissue seen in some organoid models, further verified by qualitative proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, may argue in favor of organoid suitability for certain ambient profiling studies. However, to choose the appropriate model, pre-evaluation of the model's molecular characteristics in the context of the research question(s) being asked will likely provide the most appropriate strategy to move research forward. This can be achieved by performing comparative ambient MS analysis of the disease model of choice against a small amount of patient tissue to verify concordance. Disease models, however, will continue to be useful tools to orthogonally validate metabolic states of patient tissues through controlled genetic alterations that are not possible with patient specimens.	
30511397        	Interferon-γ directly induces gastric epithelial cell death and is required for progression to metaplasia.            	Chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa, often caused by autoimmune gastritis and/or infection with Helicobacter pylori, can lead to atrophy of acid-secreting parietal cells with metaplasia of remaining cells. The histological pattern marks a critical step in the progression from chronic gastritis to gastric cancer, yet underlying mechanism(s) of inflammation-induced cell death of gastric epithelial cells are poorly understood. We investigated direct effects of a type 1 cytokine associated with autoimmunity and infection, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), on gastric epithelial cells. IFN-γ was applied to three-dimensional organoid cultures of gastric epithelial cells derived from gastric corpus gland (gastroids) of control and IFN-γ receptor-deficient mice. Gastroids were also treated with supernatants from activated immune cells isolated from a mouse model of autoimmune-mediated atrophic gastritis (TxA23) with and without IFN-γ expression. Finally, histopathological analysis of atrophy and metaplasia severity was performed in TxA23 mice and compared to TxA23 × Ifng-/- mice. Gastric epithelial cells in gastroid cultures expressed IFN-γ receptor in the basolateral membrane, and gastroids died when treated with IFN-γ in an IFN-γ receptor-dependent manner. Supernatants from immune cells containing high levels of IFN-γ were highly toxic to gastroids, and toxicity was tempered when IFN-γ was either neutralized using a monoclonal antibody or when supernatants from Ifng-/- mouse immune cells were used. Finally, TxA23 × Ifng-/- mice showed near-complete abrogation of pre-cancerous histopathological atrophy and metaplasia versus IFN-γ-sufficient controls. We identify IFN-γ as a critical promoter of parietal cell atrophy with metaplasia during the progression of gastritis to gastric atrophy and metaplasia.

28468988        	ADAM12 induction by Twist1 promotes tumor invasion and metastasis via regulation of invadopodia and focal adhesions.            	The Twist1 transcription factor promotes tumor invasion and metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invadopodia-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. The critical transcription targets of Twist1 for mediating these events remain to be uncovered. Here, we report that Twist1 strongly induces expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12). We observed that the expression levels of Twist1 mRNA and ADAM12 mRNA are tightly correlated in human breast tumors. Knocking down ADAM12 blocked cell invasion in a 3D mammary organoid culture. Suppression of ADAM12 also inhibited Twist1-induced tumor invasion and metastasis in human breast tumor xenografts, without affecting primary tumor formation. Mechanistically, knockdown of ADAM12 in breast cancer cells significantly reduced invadopodia formation and matrix degradation, and simultaneously increased overall cell adhesion to the ECM. Live-imaging analysis showed that knockdown of ADAM12 significantly inhibited focal adhesion turnover. Mechanistically, both the disintegrin and metalloproteinase domains of ADAM12 are required for its function at invadopodia, whereas the metalloproteinase domain is dispensable for its function at focal adhesions. Taken together, these data suggest that ADAM12 plays a crucial role in tumor invasion and metastasis by regulating both invadopodia and focal adhesions.                © 2017.

31292446        	Activation of STAT3 signaling is mediated by TFF1 silencing in gastric neoplasia.            	TFF1, a secreted protein, plays an essential role in keeping the integrity of gastric mucosa and its barrier function. Loss of TFF1 expression in the TFF1-knockout (KO) mouse leads to a pro-inflammatory phenotype with a cascade of gastric lesions that include low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinomas. In this study, we demonstrate nuclear localization of p-STATY705, with significant overexpression of several STAT3 target genes in gastric glands from the TFF1-KO mice. We also show frequent loss of TFF1 with nuclear localization of STAT3 in human gastric cancers. The reconstitution of TFF1 protein in human gastric cancer cells and 3D gastric glands organoids from TFF1-KO mice abrogates IL6-induced nuclear p-STAT3Y705 expression. Reconstitution of TFF1 inhibits IL6-induced STAT3 transcription activity, suppressing expression of its target genes. TFF1 blocks IL6Rα-GP130 complex formation through interfering with binding of IL6 to its receptor IL6Rα. These findings demonstrate a functional role of TFF1 in suppressing gastric tumorigenesis by impeding the IL6-STAT3 pro-inflammatory signaling axis.	
29072965        	In Vitro Tissue Microarrays for Quick and Efficient Spheroid Characterization.            	Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro microphysiological cultures, such as spheroids and organoids, promise increased patient relevance and therapeutic predictivity compared with reductionist cell monolayers. However, high-throughput characterization techniques for 3D models are currently limited to simplistic live/dead assays. By sectioning and staining in vitro microtissues, researchers can examine their structure; detect DNA, RNA, and protein targets; and visualize them at the level of single cells. The morphological examination and immunochemistry staining for in vitro cultures has historically been done in a laborious manner involving testing one set of cultures at a time. We have developed a technology to rapidly screen spheroid phenotype and protein expression by arranging 66 spheroids in a gel array for paraffin embedding, sectioning, and immunohistochemsitry. The process is quick, mostly automatable, and uses 11 times less reagents than conventional techniques. Here we showcase the capabilities of the technique in an array made up of 11 different cell lines stained in conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, as well as immunohistochemistry staining for estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and human epidermal growth factor (Her-2) receptors, and TP53. This new methodology can be used in optimizing stem cell-based models of disease and development, for tissue engineering, safety screening, and efficacy screens in cancer research.	
30732675        	Mammosphere Culture of Mammary Cells from Cynomolgus Macaques (Macaca fascicularis).            	The mammary gland contains adult stem cells that are capable of self-renewal. Although these cells hold an important role in the biology and pathology of the breast, the studies of mammary stem cells are few due to the difficulty of acquiring and expanding undifferentiated adult stem cell populations. In this study, we developed mammosphere cultures from frozen mammary cells of nulliparous cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) as a culture system to enrich mammary stem cells. Small samples of mammary tissues were collected by surgical biopsy; cells were cultured in epithelial cell growth medium and cryopreserved. Cryopreserved cells were cultured into mammospheres, and the expression of markers for stemness was evaluated by using quantitative PCR analysis. Cells were further differentiated by using 2D and 3D approaches to evaluate morphology and organoid budding, respectively. The study showed that mammosphere culture resulted in an increase in the expression of mammary stem cell markers with each passage. In contrast, markers for epithelial cells and pluripotency decreased across multiple passages. The 2D differentiation of the cells showed heterogeneous morphology, whereas 3D differentiation allowed for organoid formation. The results indicate that mammospheres can be successfully developed from frozen mammary cells derived from breast tissue collected from nulliparous cynomolgus macaques through surgical biopsy. Because mammosphere cultures allow for the enrichment of a mammary stem cell population, this refined method provides a model for the in vitro or ex vivo study of mammary stem cells.	
29713660        	Esophageal 3D Culture Systems as Modeling Tools in Esophageal Epithelial Pathobiology and Personalized Medicine.            	The stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus shows a proliferative basal layer of keratinocytes that undergo terminal differentiation in overlying suprabasal layers. Esophageal pathologies, including eosinophilic esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, cause perturbations in the esophageal epithelial proliferation-differentiation gradient. Three-dimensional (3D) culture platforms mimicking in vivo esophageal epithelial tissue architecture ex vivo have emerged as powerful experimental tools for the investigation of esophageal biology in the context of homeostasis and pathology. Herein, we describe types of 3D culture that are used to model the esophagus, including organotypic, organoid, and spheroid culture systems. We discuss the development and optimization of various esophageal 3D culture models; highlight the applications, strengths, and limitations of each method; and summarize how these models have been used to evaluate the esophagus under homeostatic conditions as well as under the duress of inflammation and precancerous/cancerous conditions. Finally, we present future perspectives regarding the use of esophageal 3D models in basic science research as well as translational studies with the potential for personalized medicine.	
28874392        	Zika virus has oncolytic activity against glioblastoma stem cells.            	Glioblastoma is a highly lethal brain cancer that frequently recurs in proximity to the original resection cavity. We explored the use of oncolytic virus therapy against glioblastoma with Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus that induces cell death and differentiation of neural precursor cells in the developing fetus. ZIKV preferentially infected and killed glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) relative to differentiated tumor progeny or normal neuronal cells. The effects against GSCs were not a general property of neurotropic flaviviruses, as West Nile virus indiscriminately killed both tumor and normal neural cells. ZIKV potently depleted patient-derived GSCs grown in culture and in organoids. Moreover, mice with glioblastoma survived substantially longer and at greater rates when the tumor was inoculated with a mouse-adapted strain of ZIKV. Our results suggest that ZIKV is an oncolytic virus that can preferentially target GSCs; thus, genetically modified strains that further optimize safety could have therapeutic efficacy for adult glioblastoma patients.                © 2017 Zhu et al.	
32485209        	Drug screening identifies gemcitabine inhibiting rotavirus through alteration of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathway.            	Although rotavirus infection is usually acute and self-limiting, it can cause chronic infection with severe diseases in immunocompromised patients, including organ transplantation recipients and cancer patients irrespective of pediatric or adult patients. Since no approved medication against rotavirus infection is available, this study screened a library of safe-in-man broad-spectrum antivirals. We identified gemcitabine, a widely used anti-cancer drug, as a potent inhibitor of rotavirus infection. We confirmed this effect in 2D cell cultures and 3D cultured human intestinal organoids with both laboratory-adapted rotavirus strains and five clinical isolates. Supplementation of UTP or uridine largely abolished the anti-rotavirus activity of gemcitabine, suggesting its function through inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. Our results support repositioning of gemcitabine for treating rotavirus infection, especially for infected cancer patients.                Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

30790135        	Wnt Signaling Mediates the Aging-Induced Differentiation Impairment of Intestinal Stem Cells.            	Stem cell aging underlies aging-associated disorders, such as steeply increased incidences of tumors and impaired regeneration capacity upon stress. However, whether and how the intestinal stem cells age remains largely unknown. Here we show that intestinal stem cells derived from 24-month-old mice hardly form typical organoids with crypt-villus structures, but rather mainly form big, rounded cysts devoid of differentiated cell types, which mimics the culturing of heterozygous APC-deficient cells from the APCmin mouse line. Further analysis showed that cultured crypts derived from aged mice exhibited reduced expression levels of differentiation genes and higher expression of Wnt target genes. Lowering the concentration of R-spondin-1 in the culture system significantly reduced formation of rounded cysts, accompanied by an increased formation of organoids from crypts derived from old mice. We are the first to uncover that intestinal stem cells derived from old mice harbor significant deficiency in differentiation that can be partially rescued through a reduction in R-spondin-1 exposure. This could be highly relevant to intestinal tumor development and the reduced regeneration potential observed in the aged population. Our study provides the first experimental evidence that an over-responsiveness to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling of aged intestinal stem cells mediates the aging-induced deficiency in differentiation, and could serve as a potential target to ameliorate aging-associated intestinal pathologies.	
32486365        	Patient-Derived In Vitro Models for Drug Discovery in Colorectal Carcinoma.            	Lack of relevant preclinical models that reliably recapitulate the complexity and heterogeneity of human cancer has slowed down the development and approval of new anti-cancer therapies. Even though two-dimensional in vitro culture models remain widely used, they allow only partial cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions and therefore do not represent the complex nature of the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, better models reflecting intra-tumor heterogeneity need to be incorporated in the drug screening process to more reliably predict the efficacy of drug candidates. Classic methods of modelling colorectal carcinoma (CRC), while useful for many applications, carry numerous limitations. In this review, we address the recent advances in in vitro CRC model systems, ranging from conventional CRC patient-derived models, such as conditional reprogramming-based cell cultures, to more experimental and state-of-the-art models, such as cancer-on-chip platforms or liquid biopsy.	
32170918        	Propagation of human prostate tissue from induced pluripotent stem cells.            	Primary culture of human prostate organoids and patient-derived xenografts is inefficient and has limited access to clinical tissues. This hampers their use for translational study to identify new treatments. To overcome this, we established a complementary approach where rapidly proliferating and easily handled induced pluripotent stem cells enabled the generation of human prostate tissue in vivo and in vitro. By using a coculture technique with inductive urogenital sinus mesenchyme, we comprehensively recapitulated in situ 3D prostate histology, and overcame limitations in the primary culture of human prostate stem, luminal and neuroendocrine cells, as well as the stromal microenvironment. This model now unlocks new opportunities to undertake translational studies of benign and malignant prostate disease.                © 2020 The Authors.

33653893        	Fusobacterium nucleatum Secretes Outer Membrane Vesicles and Promotes Intestinal Inflammation.            	Multiple studies have implicated microbes in the development of inflammation, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Bacteria in the genus Fusobacterium have been identified in the intestinal mucosa of patients with digestive diseases; thus, we hypothesized that Fusobacterium nucleatum promotes intestinal inflammation. The addition of >50 kDa F. nucleatum conditioned media, which contain outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), to colonic epithelial cells stimulated secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In addition, purified F. nucleatum OMVs, but not compounds <50 kDa, stimulated IL-8 and TNF production; which was decreased by pharmacological inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). These effects were linked to downstream effectors p-ERK, p-CREB, and NF-κB. F. nucleatum >50-kDa compounds also stimulated TNF secretion, p-ERK, p-CREB, and NF-κB activation in human colonoid monolayers. In mice harboring a human microbiota, pretreatment with antibiotics and a single oral gavage of F. nucleatum resulted in inflammation. Compared to mice receiving vehicle control, mice treated with F. nucleatum showed disruption of the colonic architecture, with increased immune cell infiltration and depleted mucus layers. Analysis of mucosal gene expression revealed increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (KC, TNF, IL-6, IFN-γ, and MCP-1) at day 3 and day 5 in F. nucleatum-treated mice compared to controls. These proinflammatory effects were absent in mice who received F. nucleatum without pretreatment with antibiotics, suggesting that an intact microbiome is protective against F. nucleatum-mediated immune responses. These data provide evidence that F. nucleatum promotes proinflammatory signaling cascades in the context of a depleted intestinal microbiome.IMPORTANCE Several studies have identified an increased abundance of Fusobacterium in the intestinal tracts of patients with colon cancer, liver cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, HIV infection, and alcoholism. However, the direct mechanism(s) of action of Fusobacterium on pathophysiological within the gastrointestinal tract is unclear. These studies have identified that F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum releases outer membrane vesicles which activate TLR4 and NF-κB to stimulate proinflammatory signals in vitro Using mice harboring a human microbiome, we demonstrate that F. nucleatum can promote inflammation, an effect which required antibiotic-mediated alterations in the gut microbiome. Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism by which F. nucleatum may contribute to intestinal inflammation.                Copyright © 2021 Engevik et al.	
33562801        	Challenges and Opportunities in NUT Carcinoma Research.            	NUT carcinoma (NC) is a type of aggressive cancer driven by chromosome translocations. Fusion genes between a DNA-binding protein, such as bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, and the testis-specific protein NUTM1 generated by these translocations drive the formation of NC. NC can develop in very young children without significant accumulation of somatic mutations, presenting a relatively clean model to study the genetic etiology of oncogenesis. However, after 20 years of research, a few challenging questions still remain for understanding the mechanism and developing therapeutics for NC. In this short review, we first briefly summarize the current knowledge regarding the molecular mechanism and targeted therapy development of NC. We then raise three challenging questions: (1) What is the cell of origin of NC? (2) How does the germline analogous epigenetic reprogramming process driven by the BET-NUTM1 fusion proteins cause NC? and (3) How will BET-NUTM1 targeted therapies be developed? We propose that with the unprecedented technological advancements in genome editing, animal models, stem cell biology, organoids, and chemical biology, we have unique opportunities to address these challenges.	
33545304        	CBP/P300 Inhibitors Mitigate Radiation-Induced GI Syndrome by Promoting Intestinal Stem Cell-Mediated Crypt Regeneration.            	Radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (RIGS) is currently the main cause of death for people exposed to a high dose of irradiation during nuclear incidents, and there is currently no approved effective therapy. Here, we found that CBP/P300 inhibitors, with high efficacy and low toxicity, might be promising radiation mitigators that can cure RIGS.                Ex vivo 3D organoid cultures derived from mouse jejunum and human ileum and colon were used to examine the radio-mitigative effects of CBP/P300 inhibitors. The radio-mitigative effect was evaluated by quantifying the survival rate and size of organoids after radiation. SGC-CBP30 (50 mg/kg body weight), an inhibitor of CBP/P300, was intraperitoneally injected into C57B/6J mice 24 hours after subtotal-body irradiation or whole-body irradiation. The regenerated crypts and animal survival were determined by microcolony assay and the Kaplan-Meier method, respectively. Lgr5-lacZ mice were used to evaluate the survival of intestinal stem cells after treatments.                We found that CBP/P300 inhibitors were effective mitigators that could be used to treat RIGS. CBP/P300 inhibition promoted the regeneration of intestinal organoids in vitro and of crypts in vivo. Remarkably, the administration of CBP/P300 inhibitors to mice 24 hours after lethal irradiation promoted Lgr5+ intestinal stem cell and crypt recovery, resulting in improved mouse survival. Moreover, our data show that CBP/P300 inhibitors rescued irradiated mice from RIGS by delaying intestinal epithelial cell cycle progression after radiation.                These data demonstrate that CBP/P300 inhibitors are effective medical countermeasures to mitigate gastrointestinal toxicity from radiation.                Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

26880118        	Three-dimensional Organotypic Culture Models of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma.            	Three-dimensional cell culture methods are viable in vitro approaches that facilitate the examination of biological features cancer cells present in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in porous alginate scaffolds can generate organoid-like spheroids that mimic numerous features of glandular epithelium in vivo, such as acinar morphogenesis and apical expression patterns of EpCAM, a hepatic stem/progenitor cell marker highly expressed in a subset of HCC with stemness features. We show that the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, an essential pathway for maintaining HCC stemness, is required for EpCAM(+) HCC spheroid formation as well as the maintenance of the acinous structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EpCAM(+) HCC cells cultured as spheroids are more sensitive to TGF/β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition with highly tumorigenic and metastatic potential in vivo compared to conventional two-dimensional (2D) culture. In addition, HCC cells in EpCAM(+) spheroids are more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents than 2D-cultured cells. The alginate scaffold-based organotypic culture system is a promising, reliable, and easy system that can be configured into a high throughput fashion for the identification of critical signaling pathways and screening of molecular drug targets specific for HCC.	
27873093        	Fatty acids in a high-fat diet potentially induce gastric parietal-cell damage and metaplasia in mice.            	Obesity is associated with risk of adenocarcinoma in the proximal stomach. We aimed to identify the links between dietary fat and gastric premalignant lesions.                C57BL/6 mice were fed high fat diet (HFD), and gastric mucosa was histologically analysed. Morphological changes were also analysed using an electron microscope. Transcriptome analysis of purified parietal cells was performed, and non-parietal gastric corpus epithelial cells were subjected to single-cell gene-expression profiling. Composition of gastric contents of HFD-fed mice was compared with that of the HFD itself. Lipotoxicity of free fatty acids (FFA) was examined in primary culture and organoid culture of mouse gastric epithelial cells in vitro, as well as in vivo, feeding FFA-rich diets.                During ~8-20 weeks of HFD feeding, the parietal cells of the stomach displayed mitochondrial damage, and a total of 23% of the mice developed macroscopically distinct metaplastic lesions in the gastric corpus mucosa. Transcriptome analysis of parietal cells indicated that feeding HFD enhanced pathways related to cell death. Histological analysis and gene-expression profiling indicated that the lesions were similar to previously reported precancerous lesions identified as spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia. FFAs, including linoleic acid with refluxed bile acids were detected in the stomachs of the HFD-fed mice. In vitro, FFAs impaired mitochondrial function and decreased the viability of parietal cells. In vivo, linoleic acid-rich diet, but not stearic acid-rich diet induced parietal-cell loss and metaplastic changes in mice.                Dietary lipids induce parietal-cell damage and may lead to the development of precancerous metaplasia.

31871532        	Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1): More than a regulator of chloride transport and mucus production.            	CLCA1 is a member of the CLCA (calcium-activated chloride channel regulator) family and plays an essential role in goblet cell mucus production from the respiratory tract epithelium. CLCA1 also regulates Ca2+-dependent Cl- transport that involves the channel protein transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A) and its accessary molecules. CLCA1 modulates epithelial cell chloride current and participates in the pathogenesis of mucus hypersecretory-associated respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, colon colitis, cystic fibrosis intestinal mucous disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastrointestinal parasitic infection. Most studies have been focused on the expression regulation of CLCA1 in human specimens. Limited studies used the CLCA1-deficient mice and CLCA1 blocking agents and yielded inconsistent conclusions regarding its role in these diseases. CLCA1 not only regulates mucin expression, but also participates in innate immune responses by binding to yet unidentified molecules on inflammatory cells for cytokine and chemokine production. CLCA1 also targets lymphatic endothelial cells and cancer cells by regulating lymphatic cell proliferation and lymphatic sinus growth in the lymphatic organs and controlling cancer cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, all which depend on the location of the lymphatic vessels, the type of cancers, the presence of Th2 cytokines, and possibly the availability and type of CLCA1-binding proteins. Here we summarize available studies related to these different activities of CLCA1 to assist our understanding of how this secreted modifier of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) affects mucus production and innate immunity during the pathogenesis of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and malignant diseases.                © 2019 The Authors.	
31767783        	Foliate Lymphoid Aggregates as Novel Forms of Serous Lymphocyte Entry Sites of Peritoneal B Cells and High-Grade B Cell Lymphomas.            	The cellular homeostasis of lymphoid tissues is determined by the continuous interactions of mobile hematopoietic cells within specialized microenvironments created by sessile stromal cells. In contrast to the lymph nodes and mucosal lymphoid tissues with well-defined entry and exit routes, the movement of leukocytes in the peritoneal cavity is largely unknown. In this study, we report that, in addition to the omental milky spots and fat-associated lymphoid clusters, in mice, the serous surface of the mesenteric adipose streaks contains lymphocyte-rich organoids comprised of a highly compacted leaf-like part connected to the adipose tissue that can also efficiently bind B cells and high-grade B cell lymphoma (diffuse large B cell lymphoma) cells. Denoted as foliate lymphoid aggregates (FLAgs), these structures show incomplete T/B segregation and a partially differentiated stromal architecture. LYVE-1-positive macrophages covering FLAgs efficiently bind i.p. injected normal B cells as well as different types of diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells. Within FLAgs, the lymphocytes compartmentalize according to their chemokine receptor pattern and subsequently migrate toward the mesenteric lymph nodes via the mesenteric lymphatic capillaries. The blood supply of FLAgs includes short vascular segments displaying peripheral lymph node addressin, and the extravasation of lymphocytes to the omental and mesenteric adipose tissues is partly mediated by L-selectin. The appearance of i.p. injected cells in mesenteric lymph nodes suggests that the mesentery-associated lymphatics may also collect leukocytes from the fat-associated lymphoid clusters and FLAgs, thus combining the mucosal and serous exit of mobile leukocytes and increasing the range of drainage sites for the peritoneal expansion of lymphoid malignancies.

33094211        	PDX: Moving Beyond Drug Screening to Versatile Models for Research Discovery.            	Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are tools of the trade for many researchers from all disciplines and medical specialties. Most endocrinologists, and especially those working in oncology, commonly use PDXs for preclinical drug testing and development, and over the last decade large collections of PDXs have emerged across all tumor streams. In this review, we examine how the field has evolved to include PDXs as versatile resources for research discoveries, providing evidence for guidelines and changes in clinical practice.                © The Author(s) 2020.

33068426        	Elimination of Nf-kB signaling in Vimentin+ stromal cells attenuates tumorigenesis in a mouse model of Barrett Esophagus.            	Chronic inflammation induces Barrett Esophagus (BE) which can advance to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Elevated levels of IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 together with activated NF-kB, have been identified as important mediators of tumorigenesis. The inflammatory milieu apart from cancer cells and infiltrating immune cells, contains myofibroblasts (MF) that express aSMA and Vimentin. As we observed that increased NF-kB activation and inflammation correlates with increased MF recruitment and an accelerated phenotype we here analyze the role of NF-kB in MF during esophageal carcinogenesis in our L2-IL-1B mouse model. To analyze the effect of NF-kB signaling in MFs, we crossed L2-IL-1B mice to tamoxifen inducible Vim-Cre (Vim-CreTm) mice and floxed RelA (p65fl/fl) mice to specifically eliminate NF-kB signaling in MF (IL-1b.Vim-CreTm.p65fl/fl). The interaction of epithelial cells and stromal cells was further analyzed in mouse BE organoids and patient-derived human organoids. Histological scoring of IL-1b.Vim-CreTm.p65fl/fl mice showed a significantly attenuated phenotype compared to L2-IL-1B mice, with mild inflammation, decreased metaplasia and no dysplasia. This correlated with decreased proliferation and increased differentiation in cardia tissue of IL-1b.Vim-CreTm.p65fl/fl compared to L2-IL-1B mice. Distinct changes of cytokines and chemokines within the local microenvironment in IL-1b.Vim-CreTm.p65fl/fl mice reflected the histopathological abrogated phenotype. Co-cultured NF-kB inhibitor treated MF with mouse BE organoids demonstrated NF-kB dependent growth and migration. MF are essential to form an inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic microenvironment and NF-kB signaling in stromal cells emerges as an important driver of esophageal carcinogenesis. Our data suggest anti-inflammatory approaches as preventive strategies during surveillance of BE patients.                © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

28442587        	Combined AURKA and H3K9 Methyltransferase Targeting Inhibits Cell Growth By Inducing Mitotic Catastrophe.            	The current integrative pathobiologic hypothesis states that pancreatic cancer (PDAC) develops and progresses in response to an interaction between known oncogenes and downstream epigenomic regulators. Congruently, this study tests a new combinatorial therapy based on the inhibition of the Aurora kinase A (AURKA) oncogene and one of its targets, the H3K9 methylation-based epigenetic pathway. This therapeutic combination is effective at inhibiting the in vitro growth of PDAC cells both, in monolayer culture systems, and in three-dimensional spheroids and organoids. The combination also reduces the growth of PDAC xenografts in vivo Mechanistically, it was found that inhibiting methyltransferases of the H3K9 pathway in cells, which are arrested in G2-M after targeting AURKA, decreases H3K9 methylation at centromeres, induces mitotic aberrations, triggers an aberrant mitotic check point response, and ultimately leads to mitotic catastrophe. Combined, these data describe for the first time a hypothesis-driven design of an efficient combinatorial treatment that targets a dual oncogenic-epigenomic pathway to inhibit PDAC cell growth via a cytotoxic mechanism that involves perturbation of normal mitotic progression to end in mitotic catastrophe. Therefore, this new knowledge has significant mechanistic value as it relates to the development of new therapies as well as biomedical relevance.Implications: These results outline a model for the combined inhibition of a genetic-to-epigenetic pathway to inhibit cell growth and suggest an important and provocative consideration for harnessing the capacity of cell-cycle inhibitors to enhance the future use of epigenetic inhibitors.

33093149        	Detection of Chemotherapy-resistant Pancreatic Cancer Using a Glycan Biomarker, sTRA.            	A subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) is highly resistant to systemic chemotherapy, but no markers are available in clinical settings to identify this subset. We hypothesized that a glycan biomarker for PDACs called sialylated tumor-related antigen (sTRA) could be used for this purpose.                We tested for differences between PDACs classified by glycan expression in multiple systems: sets of cell lines, organoids, and isogenic cell lines; primary tumors; and blood plasma from human subjects.                The sTRA-expressing models tended to have stem-like gene expression and the capacity for mesenchymal differentiation, in contrast to the nonexpressing models. The sTRA cell lines also had significantly increased resistance to seven different chemotherapeutics commonly used against pancreatic cancer. Patients with primary tumors that were positive for a gene expression classifier for sTRA received no statistically significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, in contrast to those negative for the signature. In another cohort, based on direct measurements of sTRA in tissue microarrays, the patients who were high in sTRA again had no statistically significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, a blood plasma test for the sTRA glycan identified the PDACs that showed rapid relapse following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.                This research demonstrates that a glycan biomarker could have value to detect chemotherapy-resistant PDAC in clinical settings. This capability could aid in the development of stratified treatment plans and facilitate biomarker-guided trials targeting resistant PDAC.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
32824407        	Evolution of the Experimental Models of Cholangiocarcinoma.            	Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare, aggressive disease with poor overall survival. In advanced cases, surgery is often not possible or fails; in addition, there is a lack of effective and specific therapies. Multidisciplinary approaches and advanced technologies have improved the knowledge of CCA molecular pathogenesis, highlighting its extreme heterogeneity and high frequency of genetic and molecular aberrations. Effective preclinical models, therefore, should be based on a comparable level of complexity. In the past years, there has been a consistent increase in the number of available CCA models. The exploitation of even more complex CCA models is rising. Examples are the use of CRISPR/Cas9 or stabilized organoids for in vitro studies, as well as patient-derived xenografts or transgenic mouse models for in vivo applications. Here, we examine the available preclinical CCA models exploited to investigate: (i) carcinogenesis processes from initiation to progression; and (ii) tools for personalized therapy and innovative therapeutic approaches, including chemotherapy and immune/targeted therapies. For each model, we describe the potential applications, highlighting both its advantages and limits.	
30747839        	Suppression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Mycophenolic Acid in Experimental Models and in Patients.            	Tumor recurrence is a major complication following liver transplantation (LT) as treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunosuppression is an important risk factor for HCC recurrence, but conceivably may depend on the type of immunosuppressive medication. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a currently widely used immunosuppressant. This study investigated the effects of MPA on HCC.                Three human HCC cell lines and organoids from mouse primary liver tumor were used as experimental models. MTT, Alamar Blue assay, cell cycle analysis, colony formation, and [3H]-thymidine assays were performed. An LT database was used for retrospective analysis of the effect of mycophenolate mofetil, the prodrug of MPA, on HCC recurrence.                With clinically achievable concentrations, MPA effectively inhibited HCC cell proliferation and single-cell colony-forming unit. In short-term experiments, MPA effectively elicited S phase arrest in HCC cell lines. In addition, the initiation and growth of liver tumor organoids were effectively inhibited by MPA. Most importantly, the use of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with HCC-related LT was significantly associated with less tumor recurrence and improved patient survival.                MPA can specifically counteract HCC growth in vitro and tumor recurrence in LT patients. These results warrant prospective clinical trials into the role of MPA-mediated immunosuppression following LT of patients with HCC.	
26608110        	High-throughput imaging: Focusing in on drug discovery in 3D.            	3D organotypic culture models such as organoids and multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are becoming more widely used for drug discovery and toxicology screening. As a result, 3D culture technologies adapted for high-throughput screening formats are prevalent. While a multitude of assays have been reported and validated for high-throughput imaging (HTI) and high-content screening (HCS) for novel drug discovery and toxicology, limited HTI/HCS with large compound libraries have been reported. Nonetheless, 3D HTI instrumentation technology is advancing and this technology is now on the verge of allowing for 3D HCS of thousands of samples. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art high-throughput imaging systems, including hardware and software, and recent literature examples of 3D organotypic culture models employing this technology for drug discovery and toxicology screening.

32810272        	Extracellular vesicles engineered with valency-controlled DNA nanostructures deliver CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene therapy.            	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great promise for transporting CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided endonucleases (RNP) throughout the body. However, the cell-selective delivery of EVs is still a challenge. Here, we designed valency-controlled tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) conjugated with DNA aptamer, and loaded the valency-controlled TDNs on EV surface via cholesterol anchoring for specific cell targeting. The targeting efficacy of different ratios of aptamer/cholesterol from 1:3 to 3:1 in TDNs on decorating EVs was investigated. TDNs with one aptamer and three cholesterol anchors (TDN1) efficiently facilitated the tumor-specific accumulation of the EVs in cultured HepG2 cells and human primary liver cancer-derived organoids, as well as xenograft tumor models. The intracellular delivery of RNP by TDN1-EVs successfully realized its subsequent genome editing, leading to the downregulation of GFP or WNT10B in specific cells. This system was ultimately applied to reduce the protein expression of WNT10B, which presented remarkable tumor growth inhibition in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, and could be extended to other therapeutic targets. The present study provides a platform for the directional display of aptamer on surface labeling and the EVs-based Cas9 delivery, which provides a meaningful idea for future cell-selective gene editing.                © The Author(s) 2020.

33566751        	Targeted Intestinal Deletion of Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 7, βPIX, Impairs Enterocyte Proliferation, Villus Maturation and Mucosal Defenses in Mice.            	Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) regulate Rho GTPase activity and cytoskeletal and cell adhesion dynamics. βPix, a CDC42/RAC family RhoGEF encoded by ARHGEF7, is reported to modulate human colon cancer cell proliferation and post-wounding restitution of rat intestinal epithelial monolayers. We hypothesized βPix plays a role in maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we examined βPix distribution in the human and murine intestine and created mice with intestinal epithelial-selective βPix deletion [βPixflox/flox/Tg(Villin-Cre); Arhgef7 CKO mice]. Using Arhgef7 CKO and control mice, we investigated the consequences of βPix deficiency in vivo on intestinal epithelial and enteroid development, dextran sodium sulfate-induced mucosal injury, and gut permeability. In normal human and murine intestines, we observed diffuse cytoplasmic and moderate nuclear βPix immunostaining in enterocytes. Arhgef7 CKO mice were viable and fertile with normal gross intestinal architecture but reduced small intestinal villus height, villus/crypt ratio, and goblet cells; small intestinal crypt cells had reduced Ki67 staining, compatible with impaired cell proliferation. Enteroids derived from control mouse small intestine were viable for more than 20 passages, but those from Arhgef7 CKO mice did not survive beyond 24 h despite adding Wnt proteins or conditioned media from normal enteroids. Adding a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor partially rescued CKO enteroid development. Compared to littermate control mice, dextran sodium sulfate-treated βPix-deficient mice lost more weight, had greater impairment of intestinal barrier function, and more severe colonic mucosal injury. These findings reveal βPix expression is important for enterocyte development, intestinal homeostasis and resistance to toxic injury.	
32739935        	Neuroendocrine Carcinomas of the Gallbladder: A Clinicopathologic and Immunohistochemical Analysis of 34 Resected Cases.            	Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is an aggressive malignant tumor that rarely arises from the gallbladder. Here, we investigated the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of 34 NECs of the gallbladder. The patients were predominantly women (68%) with a median age of 63 years (range, 37 to 82 y). NECs frequently occurred in the fundus (44%) as mass-forming lesions (66%). Histologically, 17 tumors were of small cell type, and another 17 were of large cell type. Twenty-three cases (68%) were associated with biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (38%) and intracholecystic papillary neoplasm (29%). The majority of tumors exhibited a diffuse growth pattern (74%), followed by organoid (24%) or scirrhous (2%) growth patterns. Histologic features related to neuroendocrine differentiation, such as nuclear molding (56%), perilobular pseudopalisading (18%), and rosette formation (15%), were identified. Immunohistochemically, cytokeratin 7 and 20 were expressed in 19 (56%) and 8 (24%) cases, respectively. Loss of Rb1 expression and concomitant overexpression of p16 were observed in 25 (74%) cases. No BRAF mutations were identified in any of the 34 NECs. For survival analysis, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 64%, 35%, and 19%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, the receipt of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy was identified as the only independent prognostic factor associated with the overall survival rate. The 1- and 3-year overall survival rates of patients with NECs were poorer for patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder (P<0.001). The complete resection and application of postoperative adjuvant therapy may influence a better clinical outcome in patients with NEC of the gallbladder.	
28614706        	Enhanced Rate of Acquisition of Point Mutations in Mouse Intestinal Adenomas Compared to Normal Tissue.            	The most prevalent single-nucleotide substitution (SNS) found in cancers is a C-to-T substitution in the CpG motif. It has been proposed that many of these SNSs arise during organismal aging, prior to transformation of a normal cell into a precancerous/cancer cell. Here, we isolated single intestinal crypts derived from normal tissue or from adenomas of Apcmin/+ mice, expanded them minimally in vitro as organoids, and performed exome sequencing to identify point mutations that had been acquired in vivo at the single-cell level. SNSs, most of them being CpG-to-TpG substitutions, were at least ten times more frequent in adenoma than normal cells. Thus, contrary to the view that substitutions of this type are present due to normal-cell aging, the acquisition of point mutations increases upon transformation of a normal intestinal cell into a precancerous cell.

29305721        	Paragangliomas arise through an autonomous vasculo-angio-neurogenic program inhibited by imatinib.            	Tumours can be viewed as aberrant tissues or organs sustained by tumorigenic stem-like cells that engage into dysregulated histo/organogenetic processes. Paragangliomas, prototypical organoid tumours constituted by dysmorphic variants of the vascular and neural tissues found in normal paraganglia, provide a model to test this hypothesis. To understand the origin of paragangliomas, we built a biobank comprising 77 cases, 18 primary cultures, 4 derived cell lines, 80 patient-derived xenografts and 11 cell-derived xenografts. We comparatively investigated these unique complementary materials using morphofunctional, ultrastructural and flow cytometric assays accompanied by microRNA studies. We found that paragangliomas contain stem-like cells with hybrid mesenchymal/vasculoneural phenotype, stabilized and expanded in the derived cultures. The viability and growth of such cultures depended on the downregulation of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, which allowed high PDGFRA and ZEB1 protein expression levels. Both tumour tissue- and cell culture-derived xenografts recapitulated the vasculoneural paraganglioma structure and arose from mesenchymal-like cells through a fixed developmental sequence. First, vasculoangiogenesis organized the microenvironment, building a perivascular niche which in turn supported neurogenesis. Neuroepithelial differentiation was associated with severe mitochondrial dysfunction, not present in cultured paraganglioma cells, but acquired in vivo during xenograft formation. Vasculogenesis was the Achilles' heel of xenograft development. In fact, imatinib, that targets endothelial-mural signalling, blocked paraganglioma xenograft formation (11 xenografts from 12 cell transplants in the control group versus 2 out of 10 in the treated group, P = 0.0015). Overall our key results were unaffected by the SDHx gene carrier status of the patient, characterized for 70 out of 77 cases. In conclusion, we explain the biphasic vasculoneural structure of paragangliomas and identify an early and pharmacologically actionable phase of paraganglioma organization.	
23324343        	Immunosurveillance against tetraploidization-induced colon tumorigenesis.            	Circumstantial evidence suggests that colon carcinogenesis can ensue the transient tetraploidization of (pre-)malignant cells. In line with this notion, the tumor suppressors APC and TP53, both of which are frequently inactivated in colon cancer, inhibit tetraploidization in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that-contrarily to their wild-type counterparts- Tp53 (-/-)  colonocytes are susceptible to drug-induced or spontaneous tetraploidization in vitro. Colon organoids generated from tetraploid Tp53 (-/-)  cells exhibit a close-to-normal morphology as compared to their diploid Tp53 (-/-)  counterparts, yet the colonocytes constituting these organoids are characterized by an increased cell size and an elevated expression of the immunostimulatory protein calreticulin on the cell surface. The subcutaneous injection of tetraploid Tp53 (-/-)  colon organoids led to the generation of proliferating tumors in immunodeficient, but not immunocompetent, mice. Thus, tetraploid Tp53 (-/-)  colonocytes fail to survive in immunocompetent mice and develop neoplastic lesions in immunocompromised settings only. These results suggest that tetraploidy is particularly oncogenic in the context of deficient immunosurveillance.	
29491834        	From Chemotherapy to Combined Targeted Therapeutics: In Vitro and in Vivo Models to Decipher Intra-tumor Heterogeneity.            	Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and other omics technologies capable to map cell fate provide increasing evidence on the crucial role of intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) for cancer progression. The different facets of ITH, from genomic to microenvironmental heterogeneity and the hierarchical cellular architecture originating from the cancer stem cell compartment, contribute to the range of tumor phenotypes. Decoding these complex data resulting from the analysis of tumor tissue complexity poses a challenge for developing novel therapeutic strategies that can counteract tumor evolution and cellular plasticity. To achieve this aim, the development of in vitro and in vivo cancer models that resemble the complexity of ITH is crucial in understanding the interplay of cells and their (micro)environment and, consequently, in testing the efficacy of new targeted treatments and novel strategies of tailoring combinations of treatments to the individual composition of the tumor. This challenging approach may be an important cornerstone in overcoming the development of pharmaco-resistances during multiple lines of treatment. In this paper, we report the latest advances in patient-derived 3D (PD3D) cell cultures and patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) as in vitro and in vivo models that can retain the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the tumor tissue.	
31737571        	Quantitative Spatial Analysis of Metabolic Heterogeneity Across in vivo and in vitro Tumor Models.            	Metabolic preferences of tumor cells vary within a single tumor, contributing to tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and patient relapse. However, the relationship between tumor treatment response and metabolically distinct tumor cell populations is not well-understood. Here, a quantitative approach was developed to characterize spatial patterns of metabolic heterogeneity in tumor cell populations within in vivo xenografts and 3D in vitro cultures (i.e., organoids) of head and neck cancer. Label-free images of cell metabolism were acquired using two-photon fluorescence lifetime microscopy of the metabolic co-enzymes NAD(P)H and FAD. Previous studies have shown that NAD(P)H mean fluorescence lifetimes can identify metabolically distinct cells with varying drug response. Thus, density-based clustering of the NAD(P)H mean fluorescence lifetime was used to identify metabolic sub-populations of cells, then assessed in control, cetuximab-, cisplatin-, and combination-treated xenografts 13 days post-treatment and organoids 24 h post-treatment. Proximity analysis of these metabolically distinct cells was designed to quantify differences in spatial patterns between treatment groups and between xenografts and organoids. Multivariate spatial autocorrelation and principal components analyses of all autofluorescence intensity and lifetime variables were developed to further improve separation between cell sub-populations. Spatial principal components analysis and Z-score calculations of autofluorescence and spatial distribution variables also visualized differences between models. This analysis captures spatial distributions of tumor cell sub-populations influenced by treatment conditions and model-specific environments. Overall, this novel spatial analysis could provide new insights into tumor growth, treatment resistance, and more effective drug treatments across a range of microscopic imaging modalities (e.g., immunofluorescence, imaging mass spectrometry).

33634984        	Epigenome screening highlights that JMJD6 confers an epigenetic vulnerability and mediates sunitinib sensitivity in renal cell carcinoma.            	Aberrant epigenetic reprogramming represents a hallmark of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumorigenesis and progression. Whether there existed other epigenetic vulnerabilities that could serve as therapeutic targets remained unclear and promising. Here, we combined the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats functional screening results and multiple RCC datasets to identify JMJD6 as the potent target in RCC. JMJD6 expression correlated with poor survival outcomes of RCC patients and promoted RCC progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, aberrant p300 led to high JMJD6 expression, which activated a series of oncogenic crosstalk. Particularly, high-throughput sequencing data revealed that JMJD6 could assemble super-enhancers to drive a list of identity genes in kidney cancer, including VEGFA, β-catenin, and SRC. Moreover, this JMJD6-mediated oncogenic effect could be suppressed by a novel JMJD6 inhibitor (SKLB325), which was further demonstrated in RCC cells, patient-derived organoid models, and in vivo. Given the probable overlapped crosstalk between JMJD6 signature and tyrosine kinase inhibitors downstream targets, targeting JMJD6 sensitized RCC to sunitinib and was synergistic when they were combined together. Collectively, this study indicated that targeting JMJD6 was an effective approach to treat RCC patients.                © 2021 The Authors.

27882268        	Long-Term Culture of Intestinal Cell Progenitors: An Overview of Their Development, Application, and Associated Technologies.            	Long-term culture of adult progenitor cells in 3D is a recently emerging technology that inhabits the space between 2D cell lines and organ slice culture.                Adaptations to defined media components in the wake of advances in ES and iPS cell culture has led to the identification of conditions that maintained intestinal cell progenitors in culture. These conditions retain cellular heterogeneity of the normal or tumour tissue, and the cultures have been shown to be genetically stable, such that substantial biobanks are being created from patient derived material. This coupled with advances in analytical tools has generated a field, characterized by the term "organoid culture", that has huge potential for advancing drug discovery, regenerative medicine, and furthering the understanding of fundamental intestinal biology.                In this review, we describe the approaches available for the long-term culture of intestinal cells from normal and diseased tissue, the current challenges, and how the technology is likely to develop further.	
32268666        	[Paraganglioma of urinary bladder: a clinicopathological features analysis of 23 cases].            	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological features, diagnosis, differential diagnosis and immunohistochemical (IHC) characteristics of paraganglioma of urinary bladder (PUB). Methods: The clinical and pathological data of 23 cases of PUB were collected at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University (7 cases); Fujian Provincial Hospital (8 cases); Fujian Medical University Union Hospital (6 cases); and First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University (2 cases) from May 2010 to November 2018. IHC staining for CK, GATA3, CD56, Syn, CgA, S-100 protein, HMB45, SDHB, OCT3/4 and Ki-67 was done using EliVision method; and the relevant literature was reviewed. Results: There were 14 women and 9 men, aged ranged from 21 to 73 years (median 51 years). Clinically, patients presented with headache, vertigo, palpitation, hypertensive crisis during micturition, hypertension, blurred vision, gross hematuria and paroxysmal pallor. The tumor sizes ranged from 0.9 to 6 cm (mean2.5 cm). Macroscopically, most tumors were exophytic and well delineated within the lamina propria or muscularis propria. The tumors were firm and nodular and showed grayish-tan cut surface. Histologically,the tumor growth pattern was expansive or showed interpenetrating infiltrative growth within the lamina propria or muscularis propria; the tumor cells were typically arranged in distinctive nests (Zellballen) with organoid arrangement; pseudo-rosette were seen in some cases. The cells were rounded or polygonal and had rich, acidophilic or amphophilic cytoplasm and may contain pigmented granules and vacuoles; the nuclei were central or eccentric, with small nucleoli, although occasionally some nuclei were pleomorphic and hyperchromatic. Spindled sustentacular cells could be seen around the nests of tumor cells in some cases. There were abundant vessels that were fissure-like, hemangioma-like or dilated. By IHC, the tumor cells were positive for GATA3 (2/23), OCT3/4 (2/23), CD56 (22/23), Syn (23/23), CgA (22/23), S-100 (sustentacular cell, 23/23) and SDHB (23/23); and negative for CK and HMB45; Ki-67 index was 1%-5%. At follow-up, there was no recurrence or metastasis in 18 cases. Conclusions: The diagnosis of PUB relies on the morphologic and IHC features; but there may be histomorphologic heterogeneity. The most important differential diagnosis is invasive urothelial carcinoma. The tumor cells may show aberrant cytoplasmic expression of OCT3/4; there is no clear correlation between SDHB and OCT3/4 expression in the group.	
30530245        	Microfluidic-enabled bottom-up hydrogels from annealable naturally-derived protein microbeads.            	Naturally-derived proteins, such as collagen, elastin, fibroin, and gelatin (denatured collagen) hold a remarkable promise for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), synthesized from the methacryloyl modification of gelatin, mimicking the structure of extracellular matrix, has widely been used as a universal multi-responsive scaffold for a broad spectrum of applications, spanning from cell therapy to bioprinting and organoid development. Despite the widespread applications of GelMA, coupled stiffness and porosity has inhibited its applications in 3D cellular engineering wherein a stiff scaffold with large pores is demanded (e.g., at concentrations >10 wt%). Taking advantage of the orthogonal thermo-chemical responsivity of GelMA, we have developed microfluidic-assisted annealable GelMA beads, that are first stabilized by temperature-mediated physical crosslinking, flowed to form a scaffold structure, and then chemically annealed using light to fabricate novel bead-based 3D GelMA scaffolds with high mechanical resilience. We show how beaded GelMA (B-GelMA) provides a self-standing microporous environment with an orthogonal void fraction and stiffness, promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and rapid 3D seeding at a high polymer concentration (∼20 wt%) that would otherwise be impossible for bulk GelMA. B-GelMA, decorated with methacryloyl and arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) peptide motifs, does not require additional functionalization for annealing and cell adhesion, providing a versatile biorthogonal platform with orthogonal stiffness and porosity for a myriad of biomedical applications. This technology provides a universal method to convert polymeric materials with orthogonal physico-chemical responsivity to modular platforms, opening a new horizon for converting bulk hydrogels to beaded hydrogels (B-hydrogels) with decoupled porosity and stiffness.

25873367        	Regulation of VDR Expression in Apc-Mutant Mice, Human Colon Cancers and Adenomas.            	One variable that may affect the ability of vitamin D to reduce colon cancer risk is the expression of its high-affinity receptor, VDR. Here, we show that vitamin D does not reduce tumor formation in Apc(Δ14/+) mice and that VDR expression is lost in the majority of the colon tumor cells. The extent of VDR loss corresponded inversely to the level of β-catenin nuclear localization and could be observed in early lesions composed of just a few crypts. Analysis of reported VDR regulators showed that the repressing class I histone deacetylases (HDAC) were significantly elevated in the tumors (up to 4-fold), whereas the VDR-activating retinoid X receptors (RXR) were downregulated (∼50%). Expression of the Slug repressor was also increased, but was found primarily in stromal cells. Analysis of epigenetically active compounds on colon cell lines and intestinal organoids showed that HDAC inhibitors were particularly adept at stimulating VDR expression. Treatment of tumor-bearing Apc(Δ14/+) mice with the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat increased VDR expression in the tumors and normal mucosa. The RXR agonist bexarotene failed to activate VDR expression, indicating that RXR ligands were not limiting. Analysis of human microarray data indicated that VDR mRNA is frequently downregulated in colon adenomas, which correlated positively with RXRA expression and inversely with HDAC 2 and 8 expression. Human adenomas showed variable VDR protein expression levels, both between and within individual lesions. Determining the mechanisms of VDR regulation in colon neoplasms may significantly enhance our ability to use vitamin D as a cancer prevention agent.                ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.	
30565271        	Ductular Reaction Cells Display an Inflammatory Profile and Recruit Neutrophils in Alcoholic Hepatitis.            	Chronic liver diseases are characterized by the expansion of ductular reaction (DR) cells and the expression of liver progenitor cell (LPC) markers. In alcoholic hepatitis (AH), the degree of DR expansion correlates with disease progression and short-term survival. However, little is known about the biological properties of DR cells, their impact on the pathogenesis of human liver disease, and their contribution to tissue repair. In this study, we have evaluated the transcriptomic profile of DR cells by laser capture microdissection in patients with AH and assessed its association with disease progression. The transcriptome analysis of cytokeratin 7-positive (KRT7+ ) DR cells uncovered intrinsic gene pathways expressed in DR and genes associated with alcoholic liver disease progression. Importantly, DR presented a proinflammatory profile with expression of neutrophil recruiting C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXC) and C-C motif chemokine ligand chemokines. Moreover, LPC markers correlated with liver expression and circulating levels of inflammatory mediators such as CXCL5. Histologically, DR was associated with neutrophil infiltration at the periportal area. In order to model the DR and to assess its functional role, we generated LPC organoids derived from patients with cirrhosis. Liver organoids mimicked the transcriptomic and proinflammatory profile of DR cells. Conditioned medium from organoids induced neutrophil migration and enhanced cytokine expression in neutrophils. Likewise, neutrophils promoted the proinflammatory profile and the expression of chemokines of liver organoids. Conclusion: Transcriptomic and functional analysis of KRT7+ cells indicate that DR has a proinflammatory profile and promote neutrophil recruitment. These results indicate that DR may be involved in the liver inflammatory response in AH, and suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting DR cells may be useful to mitigate the inflammatory cell recruitment in AH.                © 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

30220069        	Bionic 3D spheroids biosensor chips for high-throughput and dynamic drug screening.            	To perform the drug screening, planar cultured cell models are commonly applied to test efficacy and toxicity of drugs. However, planar cultured cells are different from the human 3D organs or tissues in vivo. To simulate the human 3D organs or tissues, 3D spheroids are developed by culturing a small aggregate of cells which reside around the extracellular matrix and interact with other cells in liquid media. Here we apply lung carcinoma cell lines to engineer the 3D lung cancer spheroid-based biosensor using the interdigitated electrodes for drug efficacy evaluation. The results show 3D spheroid had higher drug resistance than the planar cell model. The anticarcinogen inhibition on different 3D lung cancer spheroid models (A549, H1299, H460) can be quantitatively evaluated by electric impedance sensing. Besides, we delivered combination of anticarcinogens treatments to A549 spheroids which is commonly used in clinic treatment, and found the synergistic effect of cisplatin plus etoposide had higher drug response. To simultaneously test the drug efficacy and side effects on multi-organ model with circulatory system, a connected multiwell interdigitated electrode arraywas applied to culture different organoid spheroids. Overall, the organization of 3D cancer spheroids-based biosensor, which has higher predictive value for drug discovery and personalized medicine screening, is expected to be well applied in the area of pharmacy and clinical medicine.	
31554899        	Electrochemical live monitoring of tumor cell migration out of micro-tumors on an innovative multiwell high-dense microelectrode array.            	Understanding of cell migration and spreading out of tumor tissue is of great interest concerning the mechanism and causes of tumor malignancy and metastases. Although there are methods available for studying cell migration on monolayer cell cultures like transwell assays, novel techniques for monitoring cell spreading out of 3D organoids or tumor tissue samples are highly required. In this context, we developed an innovative high-dense microelectrode array for impedimetric monitoring of cell migration from 3D tumor cultures. For a proof of concept, a strongly migrating breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) and two malignant melanoma cell lines (T30.6.9, T12.8.10ZII) were used for generating viable micro-tumor models. The migration propensity was determined by impedimetric monitoring over 144 hours, correlated by microscopy and validated by transwell assays. The impedimetric analysis of covered electrodes and the relative impedance maximum values revealed extended information regarding the contribution of proliferative effects. More strikingly, using reference populations of mitomycin C treated spheroids where proliferation was suppressed, distinction of proliferation and migration was possible. Therefore, our high-dense microelectrode array based impedimetric migration monitoring has the capability for an automated quantitative analysis system that can be easily scaled up as well as integrated in lab on chip devices.	
23299406        	Early transformative changes in normal ovarian surface epithelium induced by oxidative stress require Akt upregulation, DNA damage and epithelial-stromal interaction.            	Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological malignancy due to detection of cancer at a late stage when the disease has metastasized. One likely progenitor cell type of ovarian cancer is the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), which proliferates rapidly in the presence of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress following ovulation. To determine whether oxidative stress induces DNA damage leading to spontaneous transformative changes in normal OSE, an immortalized mouse OSE cell line (MOSE cells) or normal mouse ovarian organoids were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and loss of contact inhibition was assessed by soft agar assay. In response to H2O2, OSE cells grown in 3D exhibited growth in soft agar but MOSE cells grown on 2D plastic did not, indicating a critical role for epithelial-stromal interactions in neoplastic initiation. Loss of contact inhibition in response to H2O2 correlated with an increase in proliferation, DNA damage and upregulation of the oncogene Akt1. Use of a reactive oxygen species scavenger or Akt inhibitor blocked H2O2-induced proliferation and growth in soft agar. Although parental MOSE cells did not undergo transformation by H2O2, MOSE cells stably overexpressing constitutively active myristoylated Akt or knockdown of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) exhibited loss of contact inhibition and increased proliferation. This study indicates that normal OSE undergo transformative changes induced by oxidative stress and that this process requires Akt upregulation and activation. A 3D model that retains tissue architecture is critical for studying this process and may lead to development of new intervention strategies directed at early stages of ovarian cancer.	
31885380        	Isolation of Stem-like Cells from 3-Dimensional Spheroid Cultures.            	Despite advances in adult stem cell research, identification and isolation of stem cells from tissue specimens remains a major challenge. While resident stem cells are relatively quiescent with niche restraints in adult tissues, they enter the cell cycle in anchor-free three-dimensional (3D) culture and undergo both symmetric and asymmetric cell division, giving rise to both stem and progenitor cells. The latter proliferate rapidly and are the major cell population at various stages of lineage commitment, forming heterogeneous spheroids. Using primary normal human prostate epithelial cells (HPrEC), a spheroid-based, label-retention assay was developed that permits the identification and functional isolation of the spheroid-initiating stem cells at a single cell resolution. HPrEC or cell lines are two-dimensionally (2D) cultured with BrdU for 10 days to permit its incorporation into the DNA of all dividing cells, including self-renewing stem cells. Wash out commences upon transfer to the 3D culture for 5 days, during which stem cells self-renew through asymmetric division and initiate spheroid formation. While relatively quiescent daughter stem cells retain BrdU-labeled parental DNA, the daughter progenitors rapidly proliferate, losing the BrdU label. BrdU can be substituted with CFSE or Far Red pro-dyes, which permit live stem cell isolation by FACS. Stem cell characteristics are confirmed by in vitro spheroid formation, in vivo tissue regeneration assays, and by documenting their symmetric/asymmetric cell divisions. The isolated label-retaining stem cells can be rigorously interrogated by downstream molecular and biologic studies, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, single cell capture, metabolic activity, proteome profiling, immunocytochemistry, organoid formation, and in vivo tissue regeneration. Importantly, this marker-free functional stem cell isolation approach identifies stem-like cells from fresh cancer specimens and cancer cell lines from multiple organs, suggesting wide applicability. It can be used to identify cancer stem-like cell biomarkers, screen pharmaceuticals targeting cancer stem-like cells, and discover novel therapeutic targets in cancers.	
33248412        	Implementing biological markers as a tool to guide clinical care of patients with pancreatic cancer.            	A major obstacle for the effective treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is its molecular heterogeneity, reflected by the diverse clinical outcomes and responses to therapies that occur. The tumors of patients with PDAC must therefore be closely examined and classified before treatment initiation in order to predict the natural evolution of the disease and the response to therapy. To stratify patients, it is absolutely necessary to identify biological markers that are highly specific and reproducible, and easily measurable by inexpensive sensitive techniques. Several promising strategies to find biomarkers are already available or under development, such as the use of liquid biopsies to detect circulating tumor cells, circulating free DNA, methylated DNA, circulating RNA, and exosomes and extracellular vesicles, as well as immunological markers and molecular markers. Such biomarkers are capable of classifying patients with PDAC and predicting their therapeutic sensitivity. Interestingly, developing chemograms using primary cell lines or organoids and analyzing the resulting high-throughput data via artificial intelligence would be highly beneficial to patients. How can exploiting these biomarkers benefit patients with resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, and metastatic PDAC? In fact, the utility of these biomarkers depends on the patient's clinical situation. At the early stages of the disease, the clinician's priority lies in rapid diagnosis, so that the patient receives surgery without delay; at advanced disease stages, where therapeutic possibilities are severely limited, the priority is to determine the PDAC tumor subtype so as to estimate the clinical outcome and select a suitable effective treatment.

28151409        	Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric pathology: insights from in vivo and ex vivo models.            	Gastric colonization with Helicobacter pylori induces diverse human pathological conditions, including superficial gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma and its precursors. The treatment of these conditions often relies on the eradication of H. pylori, an intervention that is increasingly difficult to achieve and that does not prevent disease progression in some contexts. There is, therefore, a pressing need to develop new experimental models of H. pylori-associated gastric pathology to support novel drug development in this field. Here, we review the current status of in vivo and ex vivo models of gastric H. pylori colonization, and of Helicobacter-induced gastric pathology, focusing on models of gastric pathology induced by H. pylori, Helicobacter felis and Helicobacter suis in rodents and large animals. We also discuss the more recent development of gastric organoid cultures from murine and human gastric tissue, as well as from human pluripotent stem cells, and the outcomes of H. pylori infection in these systems.                © 2017.

32825103        	Practical Review on Preclinical Human 3D Glioblastoma Models: Advances and Challenges for Clinical Translation.            	Fifteen years after the establishment of the Stupp protocol as the standard of care to treat glioblastomas, no major clinical advances have been achieved and increasing patient's overall survival remains a challenge. Nevertheless, crucial molecular and cellular findings revealed the intra-tumoral and inter-tumoral complexities of these incurable brain tumors, and the essential role played by cells of the microenvironment in the lack of treatment efficacy. Taking this knowledge into account, fulfilling gaps between preclinical models and clinical samples is necessary to improve the successful rate of clinical trials. Since the beginning of the characterization of brain tumors initiated by Bailey and Cushing in the 1920s, several glioblastoma models have been developed and improved. In this review, we focused on the most widely used 3D human glioblastoma models, including spheroids, tumorospheres, organotypic slices, explants, tumoroids and glioblastoma-derived from cerebral organoids. We discuss their history, development and especially their usefulness.	
21997934        	Myb controls intestinal stem cell genes and self-renewal.            	Rapid advances have been made in the understanding of how the highly proliferative gastrointestinal tract epithelium is regulated under homeostasis and disease. The identification of putative intestinal stem cell (ISC) genes and the ability to culture ISC capable of generating all four lineages plus the architecture of small intestinal (SI) crypts has been transformative. Here, we show that transcription factor Myb governs ISC gene expression, particularly Lgr5. Lgr5 is associated with cells that have the capacity to generate all cell lineages in SI organoid cultures and colorectal cancer cells, which overexpress Myb. Furthermore, Wnt signaling and Myb cooperate in maximal Lgr5 promoter activation while hypomorphic Myb (plt4/plt4) mice have decreased Lgr5 expression. After ionizing radiation (IR), ISC genes are elevated; but in plt4/plt4 mice, this response is substantially subdued. ISC genes bmi-1 and olfm4 are expressed at subnormal levels in plt4/plt4 mice, and bmi-1 is induced with IR to half the level in mutant mice. dcamkl-1 and olfm4 failed to recover after IR in both wild-type (wt) and mutant mice. Although not considered as an ISC gene, cyclinE1 is nevertheless used to assist cells in the emergence from a quiescent state (an expectation of ISC following IR) and is overexpressed after IR in wt mice but does not change from a very low base in plt4/plt4 mice. Self-renewal assays using organoid cultures and inducible Myb knockout studies further highlighted the dependence of ISC on Myb consistent with role in other stem cell-containing tissues.

25007964        	RANKL expression in normal and malignant breast tissue responds to progesterone and is up-regulated during the luteal phase.            	The receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) acts as a paracrine factor in progesterone-induced mammary epithelial proliferation and tumorigenesis. This evidence comes mainly from mouse models. Our aim was to examine whether RANKL expression in human normal and malignant breast is under the control of progesterone throughout the menstrual cycle. Breast epithelial samples were obtained by random fine needle aspiration (rFNA) of the contralateral unaffected breasts (CUB) of 18 breast cancer patients, with simultaneous serum hormone measurements. Genes correlated with serum progesterone levels were identified through Illumina microarray analysis. Validation was performed using qRT-PCR in rFNA samples from CUB of an additional 53 women and using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays of 61 breast cancer samples. Expression of RANKL, DIO2, and MYBPC1 was correlated with serum progesterone in CUB, and was significantly higher in luteal phase. RANKL and MYBPC1 mRNA expression were highly correlated between CUB and matched tumor samples. RANKL protein expression was also significantly increased in the luteal phase and highly correlated with serum progesterone levels in cancer samples, especially in hormone receptor positive tumors. The regulatory effects of progesterone on the expression of RANKL, DIO2, and MYBPC1 were confirmed in three-dimensional cultures of normal breast organoids. In normal breast and in breast cancer, RANKL mRNA and protein expression fluctuate with serum progesterone with highest levels in the luteal phase, suggesting that RANKL is a modulator of progesterone signaling in normal and malignant breast tissue and a potential biomarker of progesterone action and blockade.	
27514507        	Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin: ultrastructural and immunohistochemical findings.            	Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is an uncommon and aggressive neuroendocrine tumor, found mainly in the lung. Although LCNEC has been reported in various organs, LCNEC of the skin is extremely rare, poorly recognized and probably underestimated. Here we report a case of LCNEC of the skin, focusing on the histopathological and ultrastructural findings in detail. The patient was an 85-year-old Japanese woman presented with a mass on her right upper eyelid. Biopsy specimen showed an infiltrative mass with extension into the subcutis. Tumor cells were arranged in organoid and trabecular patterns with sheets, nests and trabecular cords. Extensive necrotic areas were observed. Most of the tumor cells were characterized by large cell size, polygonal shape, low nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, coarse nuclear chromatin and frequent nucleoli. They were positive for CD56, NSE, AE1/AE3, CK7, and negative for CK20, TTF-1, synaptophysin and chromogranin A. A systematic radiographic examination revealed no additional neoplastic lesions other than the right upper eyelid mass. These findings suggest that the present case is a LCNEC of the skin. The existence of LCNEC in the skin should be recognized, as it is a rare variant of carcinoma that can potentially be misconstrued as a metastasis or as Merkel cell carcinoma.                © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

32176087        	Giant fibrous hamartoma of infancy: A case report.            	Fibrous hamartoma of infancy (FHI) is a rare benign soft-tissue tumor in children with a triphasic organoid histologic appearance.                We here report a case with the largest FHI published so far. A 13-month-old boy with a rapidly growing tumor 45 cm in length and 69.3 cm in circumference of the left lower extremity was identified immediately at birth.                The diagnosis was uncertain before the operation, although biopsy was conducted. The postoperation histological examination showed arranged spindle cells, adipose tissue, and nests of immature small cells embedded in a myxoid background, which is the characteristic triphasic histology of FHI.                Under general anesthesia, hip and lower extremity amputation was performed.                The patient was followed-up for 6 years and no signs of recurrence were found, suggesting a favorable prognosis, although a part of the residual tumor was present after the surgery.                FHI exhibits pathological and clinical characteristics. However, differential diagnosis of FHI from other soft-tissue tumors before operation remains a challenge. Thus, sometimes, aggressive therapy for the treatment of FHI might be a good choice to get a satisfactory.	
29027285        	Subtle Deregulation of the Wnt-Signaling Pathway Through Loss of Apc2 Reduces the Fitness of Intestinal Stem Cells.            	The importance of the Wnt-signaling pathway on the regulation and maintenance of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) population is well recognized. However, our current knowledge base is founded on models using systems of gross deregulation of the Wnt-signaling pathway. Given the importance of this signaling pathway on intestinal homeostasis, there is a need to explore the role of more subtle alterations in Wnt-signaling levels within this tissue. Herein, we have used a model of Apc2 loss to meet this aim. Apc2 is a homolog of Apc which can also form a destruction complex capable of binding β-catenin, albeit less efficiently than Apc. We show that systemic loss of Apc2 results in an increase in the number of cells displaying nuclear β-catenin at the base of the intestinal crypt. This subsequently impacts the expression levels of several ISC markers and the fitness of ISCs as assessed by organoid formation efficiency. This work provides the first evidence that the function and fitness of ISCs can be altered by even minor misregulation of the Wnt-signaling pathway. Our data highlights the importance of correct maintenance of this crucial signaling pathway in the maintenance and function of the ISC population.

26053663        	Selenoprotein P influences colitis-induced tumorigenesis by mediating stemness and oxidative damage.            	Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk for colon cancer due to augmented oxidative stress. These patients also have compromised antioxidant defenses as the result of nutritional deficiencies. The micronutrient selenium is essential for selenoprotein production and is transported from the liver to target tissues via selenoprotein P (SEPP1). Target tissues also produce SEPP1, which is thought to possess an endogenous antioxidant function. Here, we have shown that mice with Sepp1 haploinsufficiency or mutations that disrupt either the selenium transport or the enzymatic domain of SEPP1 exhibit increased colitis-associated carcinogenesis as the result of increased genomic instability and promotion of a protumorigenic microenvironment. Reduced SEPP1 function markedly increased M2-polarized macrophages, indicating a role for SEPP1 in macrophage polarization and immune function. Furthermore, compared with partial loss, complete loss of SEPP1 substantially reduced tumor burden, in part due to increased apoptosis. Using intestinal organoid cultures, we found that, compared with those from WT animals, Sepp1-null cultures display increased stem cell characteristics that are coupled with increased ROS production, DNA damage, proliferation, decreased cell survival, and modulation of WNT signaling in response to H2O2-mediated oxidative stress. Together, these data demonstrate that SEPP1 influences inflammatory tumorigenesis by affecting genomic stability, the inflammatory microenvironment, and epithelial stem cell functions.	
31180367        	3D Analysis of Multi-cellular Responses to Chemoattractant Gradients.            	Various limitations of 2D cell culture systems have sparked interest in 3D cell culture and analysis platforms, which would better mimic the spatial and chemical complexity of living tissues and mimic in vivo tissue functions. Recent advances in microfabrication technologies have facilitated the development of 3D in vitro environments in which cells can be integrated into a well-defined extracellular matrix (ECM) and a defined set of soluble or matrix associated biomolecules. However, technological barriers have limited their widespread use in research laboratories. Here, we describe a method to construct simple devices for 3D culture and experimentation with cells and multicellular organoids in 3D microenvironments with a defined chemoattractant gradient. We illustrate the use of this platform for analysis of the response of epithelial cells and organoids to gradients of growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF gradients were stable in the devices for several days leading to directed branch formation in breast organoids. This analysis allowed us to conclude that collective gradient sensing by groups of cells is more sensitive vs. single cells. We also describe the fabrication method, which does not require photolithography facilities nor advanced soft lithography techniques. This method will be helpful to study 3D cellular behaviors in the context of the analysis of development and pathological states, including cancer.	
29517207        	Soft tissue metastasis of mediastinal non-functioning paraganglioma with unusual TTF-1 expression: a potential diagnostic pitfall.            	Metastatic extra-adrenal paragangliomas are very rare and can represent diagnostic challenges. We report a case of 69-year-old man with a tumor of the right shoulder. Histologic and immunohistochemical examinations confirmed the diagnosis of paraganglioma. Surprisingly, tumor cells were diffusely thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) positive. Succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B (SDHB) deficiency has not been detected. Inherited syndromes associated with paragangliomas were ruled out. The primary tumor was identified in the mediastinum. This is the first report of TTF-1 expression in paraganglioma. To avoid misdiagnosis, careful clinical and pathological examination of any tumor with organoid growths pattern is necessary.	
33199443        	EGFR amplification and outcome in a randomised phase III trial of chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus panitumumab for advanced gastro-oesophageal cancers.            	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition may be effective in biomarker-selected populations of advanced gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma (aGEA) patients. Here, we tested the association between outcome and EGFR copy number (CN) in pretreatment tissue and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of patients enrolled in a randomised first-line phase III clinical trial of chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody panitumumab in aGEA (NCT00824785).                EGFR CN by either fluorescence in situ hybridisation (n=114) or digital-droplet PCR in tissues (n=250) and plasma cfDNAs (n=354) was available for 474 (86%) patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Tissue and plasma low-pass whole-genome sequencing was used to screen for coamplifications in receptor tyrosine kinases. Interaction between chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors was modelled in patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from aGEA patients.                EGFR amplification in cfDNA correlated with poor survival in the ITT population and similar trends were observed when the analysis was conducted in tissue and plasma by treatment arm. EGFR inhibition in combination with chemotherapy did not correlate with improved survival, even in patients with significant EGFR CN gains. Addition of anti-EGFR inhibitors to the chemotherapy agent epirubicin in PDOs, resulted in a paradoxical increase in viability and accelerated progression through the cell cycle, associated with p21 and cyclin B1 downregulation and cyclin E1 upregulation, selectively in organoids from EGFR-amplified aGEA.                EGFR CN can be accurately measured in tissue and liquid biopsies and may be used for the selection of aGEA patients. EGFR inhibitors may antagonise the antitumour effect of anthracyclines with important implications for the design of future combinatorial trials.                © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

26028364        	Salmonella Manipulation of Host Signaling Pathways Provokes Cellular Transformation Associated with Gallbladder Carcinoma.            	Cancer is fueled by deregulation of signaling pathways in control of cellular growth and proliferation. These pathways are also targeted by infectious pathogens en route to establishing infection. Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is frequent in the Indian subcontinent, with chronic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi infection reported as a significant risk factor. However, direct association and causal mechanisms between Salmonella Typhi infection and GBC have not been established. Deconstructing the epidemiological association between GBC and Salmonella Typhi infection, we show that Salmonella enterica induces malignant transformation in predisposed mice, murine gallbladder organoids, and fibroblasts, with TP53 mutations and c-MYC amplification. Mechanistically, activation of MAPK and AKT pathways, mediated by Salmonella enterica effectors secreted during infection, is critical to both ignite and sustain transformation, consistent with observations in GBC patients from India. Collectively, our findings indicate that Salmonella enterica can promote transformation of genetically predisposed cells and is a causative agent of GBC.                Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

33396766        	Monoclonal Antibody-Based Immunotherapy and Its Role in the Development of Cardiac Toxicity.            	Immunotherapy is one of the most effective therapeutic options for cancer patients. Five specific classes of immunotherapies, which includes cell-based chimeric antigenic receptor T-cells, checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, antibody-based targeted therapies, and oncolytic viruses. Immunotherapies can improve survival rates among cancer patients. At the same time, however, they can cause inflammation and promote adverse cardiac immune modulation and cardiac failure among some cancer patients as late as five to ten years following immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss cardiotoxicity associated with immunotherapy. We also propose using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes/ cardiac-stromal progenitor cells and cardiac organoid cultures as innovative experimental model systems to (1) mimic clinical treatment, resulting in reproducible data, and (2) promote the identification of immunotherapy-induced biomarkers of both early and late cardiotoxicity. Finally, we introduce the integration of omics-derived high-volume data and cardiac biology as a pathway toward the discovery of new and efficient non-toxic immunotherapy.	
32931884        	A novel orally active microtubule destabilizing agent S-40 targets the colchicine-binding site and shows potent antitumor activity.            	The tubulin colchicine binding site has been recognized as an attractive drug target to combat cancer, but none of the candidate drugs have been approved for medical treatment. We recently identified a structurally distinct small molecule S-40 as an oral potent tubulin destabilizing agent. Crystal structure analysis of S-40 in a complex with tubulin at a resolution of 2.4 Å indicated that S-40 occupies all 3 zones in the colchicine pocket with interactions different from known microtubule inhibitors, presenting unique effects on assembly and curvature of tubulin dimers. S-40 overcomes paclitaxel resistance and lacks neurotoxicity, which are the main obstacles limiting clinical applications of paclitaxel. Moreover, S-40 harbors the ability to inhibit growth of cancer cell lines as well as patient-derived organoids, induce mitotic arrest and cell apoptosis. Xenograft mouse models of human prostate cancer DU145, non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H1299 and paclitaxel-resistant A549 were strongly restrained without apparent side effects by S-40 oral administration once daily. These findings provide evidence for the development of S-40 as the next generation of orally effective microtubule inhibitors for cancer therapy.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

33135632        	eIF4E S209 phosphorylation licenses myc- and stress-driven oncogenesis.            	To better understand a role of eIF4E S209 in oncogenic translation, we generated EIF4ES209A/+ heterozygous knockin (4EKI) HCT 116 human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. 4EKI had little impact on total eIF4E levels, cap binding or global translation, but markedly reduced HCT 116 cell growth in spheroids and mice, and CRC organoid growth. 4EKI strongly inhibited Myc and ATF4 translation, the integrated stress response (ISR)-dependent glutamine metabolic signature, AKT activation and proliferation in vivo. 4EKI inhibited polyposis in ApcMin/+ mice by suppressing Myc protein and AKT activation. Furthermore, p-eIF4E was highly elevated in CRC precursor lesions in mouse and human. p-eIF4E cooperated with mutant KRAS to promote Myc and ISR-dependent glutamine addiction in various CRC cell lines, characterized by increased cell death, transcriptomic heterogeneity and immune suppression upon deprivation. These findings demonstrate a critical role of eIF4E S209-dependent translation in Myc and stress-driven oncogenesis and as a potential therapeutic vulnerability.                © 2020, Ruan et al.

23598964        	Evidence supporting the existence of benign teratomas of the postpubertal testis: a clinical, histopathologic, and molecular genetic analysis of 25 cases.            	The existence of a benign form of postpubertal testicular teratoma, apart from the rare dermoid cyst, is not widely recognized. This study reports 25 apparently benign postpubertal testicular teratomas, including 10 cases of dermoid cyst and 15 of nondermoid teratomas, which occurred in 25 patients, 12 to 59 years of age (mean, 24 y). Postpubertal status was based on active spermatogenesis in the testis. On gross examination 15 of 16 tumors with available information had a variably prominent cystic component filled with keratinous or mucoid material. On microscopic examination, the 10 dermoid cysts were lined by keratinizing, stratified squamous epithelium with associated pilosebaceous units and sweat glands in an organoid arrangement. Squamous cysts also occurred in 10 of 15 nondermoid teratomas, which by definition lacked adnexal structures. Apart from 2 dermoid cysts additional elements occurred in all cases, most commonly ciliated or respiratory-type epithelium (64%) and smooth muscle (68%). Organoid arrangements were also present in 5 of the nondermoid teratomas. No case showed cytologic atypia nor did the parenchyma adjacent to the teratomas of either type show intratubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified type, microlithiasis, scarred zones, or more than focal perilesional tubular atrophy/sclerosis. Spermatogenesis was intact in all cases. FISH study for chromosome 12p was performed in 18 cases, and none displayed an abnormal 12p chromosome. All 17 patients that had follow-up information were alive at postoperative intervals of 5 to 168 months, although physician-confirmed disease-free status was unfortunately not available in 6 of these. This study supports the recognition and separate classification of not only dermoid cysts but also a small subset of apparently benign testicular teratomas in postpubertal patients that share many features with dermoid cysts but lack cutaneous-type adnexal structures. Features important in the recognition of both forms of these specialized teratomas of the postpubertal testis include absence of all of the following: cytologic atypia, intratubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified type, significant tubular atrophy/tubular sclerosis, scarred zones, impaired spermatogenesis, microlithiasis, and evidence of chromosome 12p amplification. Other features include frequent organoid morphology and prominent components of ciliated epithelium and smooth muscle. It is important to distinguish these teratomas from the usual ones seen in postpuberal patients because of the malignant potential of the latter.	
28977993        	Application of 3D tumoroid systems to define immune and cytotoxic therapeutic responses based on tumoroid and tissue slice culture molecular signatures.            	We have developed 3D-tumoroids and tumor slice in vitro culture systems from surgical tumor specimens derived from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) or lung cancer to evaluate immune cell populations infiltrating cultured tissues. The system incorporates patient's peripherally and tumor-derived immune cells into tumoroid in vitro cultures to evaluate the ability of the culture to mimic an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM). This system enables analysis of tumor response to standard therapy within weeks of surgical resection. Here we show that tumoroid cultures from a CRC patient are highly sensitive to the thymidylate synthase inhibitor 5-fluorouracil (adrucil) but less sensitive to the combination of nucleoside analog trifluridine and thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor tipiracil (Lonsurf). Moreover, re-introduction of isolated immune cells derived from surrounding and infiltrating tumor tissue as well as CD45+ tumor infiltrating hematopoietic cells displayed prolonged (>10 days) survival in co-culture. Established tumor slice cultures were found to contain both an outer epithelial and inner stromal cell compartment mimicking tumor structure in vivo. Collectively, these data suggest that, 3D-tumoroid and slice culture assays may provide a feasible in vitro approach to assess efficacy of novel therapeutics in the context of heterogeneous tumor-associated cell types including immune and non-transformed stromal cells. In addition, delineating the impact of therapeutics on immune cells, and cell types involved in therapeutic resistance mechanisms may be possible in general or for patient-specific responses.	
32314963        	ERK3/MAPK6 controls IL-8 production and chemotaxis.            	ERK3 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the atypical mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the physiological significance of its short half-life remains unclear. By employing gastrointestinal 3D organoids, we detect that ERK3 protein levels steadily decrease during epithelial differentiation. ERK3 is not required for 3D growth of human gastric epithelium. However, ERK3 is stabilized and activated in tumorigenic cells, but deteriorates over time in primary cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ERK3 is necessary for production of several cellular factors including interleukin-8 (IL-8), in both, normal and tumorigenic cells. Particularly, ERK3 is critical for AP-1 signaling through its interaction and regulation of c-Jun protein. The secretome of ERK3-deficient cells is defective in chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Further, knockdown of ERK3 reduces metastatic potential of invasive breast cancer cells. We unveil an ERK3-mediated regulation of IL-8 and epithelial secretome for chemotaxis.                © 2020, Bogucka et al.	GEO                                            GSE136002
32497792        	Vitamin D Receptor Protects Against Dysbiosis and Tumorigenesis via the JAK/STAT Pathway in Intestine.            	Vitamin D exerts regulatory roles via vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mucosal immunity, host defense, and inflammation involving host factors and microbiome. Human Vdr gene variation shapes the microbiome and VDR deletion leads to dysbiosis. Low VDR expression and diminished vitamin D/VDR signaling are observed in colon cancer. Nevertheless, how intestinal epithelial VDR is involved in tumorigenesis through gut microbiota remains unknown. We hypothesized that intestinal VDR protects mice against dysbiosis via modulating the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in tumorigenesis.                To test our hypothesis, we used an azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced cancer model in intestinal VDR conditional knockout (VDRΔIEC) mice, cell cultures, stem cell-derived colonoids, and human colon cancer samples.                VDRΔIEC mice have higher numbers of tumors, with the location shifted from the distal to proximal colon. Fecal microbiota analysis showed that VDR deletion leads to a bacterial profile shift from normal to susceptible carcinogenesis. We found enhanced bacterial staining in mouse and human tumors. Microbial metabolites from VDRΔIEC mice showed increased secondary bile acids, consistent with observations in human CRC. We further identified that VDR protein bound to the Jak2 promoter, suggesting that VDR transcriptionally regulated Jak2. The JAK/STAT pathway is critical in intestinal and microbial homeostasis. Fecal samples from VDRΔIEC mice activate the STAT3 signaling in human and mouse organoids. Lack of VDR led to hyperfunction of Jak2 in response to intestinal dysbiosis. A JAK/STAT inhibitor abolished the microbiome-induced activation of STAT3.                We provide insights into the mechanism of VDR dysfunction leading to dysbiosis and tumorigenesis. It indicates a new target: microbiome and VDR for the prevention of cancer.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
28955656        	Three-Dimensional Patient-Derived In Vitro Sarcoma Models: Promising Tools for Improving Clinical Tumor Management.            	Over the past decade, the development of new targeted therapeutics directed against specific molecular pathways involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival has allowed an essential improvement in carcinoma treatment. Unfortunately, the scenario is different for sarcomas, a group of malignant neoplasms originating from mesenchymal cells, for which the main therapeutic approach still consists in the combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The lack of innovative approaches in sarcoma treatment stems from the high degree of heterogeneity of this tumor type, with more that 70 different histopathological subtypes, and the limited knowledge of the molecular drivers of tumor development and progression. Currently, molecular therapies are available mainly for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, a soft-tissue malignancy characterized by an activating mutation of the tyrosine kinase KIT. Since the first application of this approach, a strong effort has been made to understand sarcoma molecular alterations that can be potential targets for therapy. The low incidence combined with the high level of histopathological heterogeneity makes the development of clinical trials for sarcomas very challenging. For this reason, preclinical studies are needed to better understand tumor biology with the aim to develop new targeted therapeutics. Currently, these studies are mainly based on in vitro testing, since cell lines, and in particular patient-derived models, represent a reliable and easy to handle tool for investigation. In the present review, we summarize the most important models currently available in the field, focusing in particular on the three-dimensional spheroid/organoid model. This innovative approach for studying tumor biology better represents tissue architecture and cell-cell as well as cell-microenvironment crosstalk, which are fundamental steps for tumor cell proliferation and survival.	
32525701        	Effects of Inorganic Arsenic on Human Prostate Stem-Progenitor Cell Transformation, Autophagic Flux Blockade, and NRF2 Pathway Activation.            	Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is an environmental toxicant associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in chronically exposed populations worldwide. However, the biological mechanisms underlying iAs-induced prostate carcinogenesis remain unclear.                We studied how iAs affects normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (PrSPCs) and drives transformation and interrogated the molecular mechanisms involved.                PrSPCs were enriched by spheroid culture from normal human primary or immortalized prostate epithelial cells, and their differentiation capability was evaluated by organoid culture. Microarray analysis was conducted to identify iAs-dysregulated genes, and lentiviral infection was used for stable manipulation of identified genes. Soft agar colony growth assays were applied to examine iAs-induced transformation. For in vivo study, PrSPCs mixed with rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme were grafted under the renal capsule of nude mice to generate prostatelike tissues, and mice were exposed to                                                     5                             ppm                                             (                                                    ∼                            65                                                        μ                            M                                            ) iAs in drinking water for 3 months.                Low-dose iAs (                                                    1                                                        μ                            M                                            ) disturbed PrSPC homeostasis in vitro, leading to increased self-renewal and suppressed differentiation. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that iAs activated oncogenic pathways in PrSPCs, including the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. Further, iAs-exposed proliferative progenitor cells exhibited NRF2 pathway activation that was sustained in their progeny cells. Knockdown of NRF2 inhibited spheroid formation by driving PrSPC differentiation, whereas its activation enhanced spheroid growth. Importantly, iAs-induced transformation was suppressed by NRF2 knockdown. Mechanistically, iAs suppressed Vacuolar ATPase subunit VMA5 expression, impairing lysosome acidification and inhibiting autophagic protein degradation including p62, which further activated NRF2. In vivo, chronic iAs exposure activated NRF2 in both epithelial and stroma cells of chimeric human prostate grafts and induced premalignant events.                Low-dose iAs increased self-renewal and decreased differentiation of human PrSPCs by activating the p62-NRF2 axis, resulting in epithelial cell transformation. NRF2 is activated by iAs through specific autophagic flux blockade in progenitor cells, which may have potential therapeutic implications. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6471.	
26872890        	Intestine-specific homeobox (ISX) induces intestinal metaplasia and cell proliferation to contribute to gastric carcinogenesis.            	Helicobacter pylori induces chronic inflammation and intestinal metaplasia (IM) through genetic and epigenetic changes and activation of intracellular signaling pathways that contribute to gastric carcinogenesis. However, the precise mechanism of IM in gastric carcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. We previously found that intestine-specific homeobox (ISX) mRNA expression increased in organoids cultured from Helicobacter-infected mouse mucosa. In this study, we elucidate the role of ISX in the development of IM and gastric carcinogenesis.                ISX expression was assessed in Helicobacter-infected mouse and human gastric mucosa. MKN45 gastric cancer cells were co-cultured with H. pylori to determine whether Helicobacter infection induced ISX expression. We established stable MKN45 transfected cells expressing ISX (Stable-ISX MKN45) and performed a spheroid colony formation assay and a xenograft model. We performed ISX immunohistochemistry in cancer and adjacent gastric tissues.                ISX expression was increased in mouse and human gastric mucosa infected with Helicobacter. The presence of IM and H. pylori infection in human stomach was correlated with ISX expression. H. pylori induced ISX mRNA and protein expression. CDX1/2, cyclinD1, and MUC2 were upregulated in Stable-ISX MKN45, whereas MUC5AC was downregulated. Stable-ISX MKN45 cells formed more spheroid colonies, and had high tumorigenic ability. ISX expression in gastric cancer and adjacent mucosa were correlated.                ISX expression induced by H. pylori infection may lead to IM and hyperproliferation of gastric mucosa through CDX1/2 and cyclinD1 expression, contributing to gastric carcinogenesis.	
21984937        	A multifunctional 3D co-culture system for studies of mammary tissue morphogenesis and stem cell biology.            	Studies on the stem cell niche and the efficacy of cancer therapeutics require complex multicellular structures and interactions between different cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM) in three dimensional (3D) space. We have engineered a 3D in vitro model of mammary gland that encompasses a defined, porous collagen/hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold forming a physiologically relevant foundation for epithelial and adipocyte co-culture. Polarized ductal and acinar structures form within this scaffold recapitulating normal tissue morphology in the absence of reconstituted basement membrane (rBM) hydrogel. Furthermore, organoid developmental outcome can be controlled by the ratio of collagen to HA, with a higher HA concentration favouring acinar morphological development. Importantly, this culture system recapitulates the stem cell niche as primary mammary stem cells form complex organoids, emphasising the utility of this approach for developmental and tumorigenic studies using genetically altered animals or human biopsy material, and for screening cancer therapeutics for personalised medicine.	
31658259        	The comprehensive role of E-cadherin in maintaining prostatic epithelial integrity during oncogenic transformation and tumor progression.            	E-cadherin complexes with the actin cytoskeleton via cytoplasmic catenins and maintains the functional characteristics and integrity of the epithelia in normal epithelial tissues. Lost expression of E-cadherin disrupts this complex resulting in loss of cell polarity, epithelial denudation and increased epithelial permeability in a variety of tissues. Decreased expression of E-cadherin has also been observed in invasive and metastatic human tumors. In this study, we investigated the effect of E-cadherin loss in prostatic epithelium using newly developed genetically engineered mouse models. Deletion of E-cadherin in prostatic luminal epithelial cells with modified probasin promoter driven Cre (PB-Cre4) induced the development of mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). An increase in levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin appeared in E-cadherin deleted atypical cells within PIN lesions. Using various experimental approaches, we further demonstrated that the knockdown of E-cadherin expression elevated free cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin and enhanced androgen-induced transcription and cell growth. Intriguingly, pathological changes representing prostatic epithelial cell denudation and increased apoptosis accompanied the above PIN lesions. The essential role of E-cadherin in maintaining prostatic epithelial integrity and organization was further demonstrated using organoid culture approaches. To directly assess the role of loss of E-cadherin in prostate tumor progression, we generated a new mouse model with bigenic Cdh1 and Pten deletion in prostate epithelium. Early onset, aggressive tumor phenotypes presented in the compound mice. Strikingly, goblet cell metaplasia was observed, intermixed within prostatic tumor lesions of the compound mice. This study provides multiple lines of novel evidence demonstrating a comprehensive role of E-cadherin in maintaining epithelial integrity during the course of prostate oncogenic transformation, tumor initiation and progression.	
31266731        	Tracing Clonal Dynamics Reveals that Two- and Three-dimensional Patient-derived Cell Models Capture Tumor Heterogeneity of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.            	Extensive DNA sequencing has led to an unprecedented view of the diversity of individual genomes and their evolution among patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).                To understand subclonal architecture and dynamics of patient-derived two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ccRCC models in vitro, in order to determine whether they mirror ccRCC inter- and intratumor heterogeneity.                We have established a comprehensive platform of living renal cancer cell models from ccRCC surgical specimens.                We confirmed the concordance of 2D and 3D patient-derived cell (PDC) models with the original tumor tissue in terms of histology, biomarker expression, cancer driver mutations, and copy number alterations. We addressed inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity by analyzing clonal dynamics during serial passaging.                In-depth genetic characterization verified the presence of heterogeneous cell populations, and revealed a high degree of similarity between subclonal compositions of monolayer and organoid cell cultures and the corresponding parental ccRCCs. Clonal dynamics were evident during serial passaging of cells in vitro, suggesting that PDC cultures can offer insights into evolutionary potential and treatment susceptibility of ccRCC subclones in vivo. Proof-of-concept drug profiling using selected ccRCC-targeted therapy agents highlighted patient-specific vulnerabilities in PDC models that could not be anticipated by interrogating commercially available cell lines.                We demonstrate that PDC models mirror inter- and intratumor heterogeneity of ccRCC in vitro. Based on our findings, we envision that the use of these models will advance our understanding of the trajectories that cause genetic diversity and their consequences for treatment on an individual level.                In this study, we developed two- and three-dimensional patient-derived models from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) as "mini-tumors in a dish." We show that these cell models retain important features of the human ccRCCs such as the profound tumor heterogeneity, thus highlighting their importance for cancer research and precision medicine.

28277923        	3D Culture as a Clinically Relevant Model for Personalized Medicine.            	Advances in understanding many of the fundamental mechanisms of cancer progression have led to the development of molecular targeted therapies. While molecular targeted therapeutics continue to improve the outcome for cancer patients, tumor heterogeneity among patients, as well as intratumoral heterogeneity, limits the efficacy of these drugs to specific patient subtypes, as well as contributes to relapse. Thus, there is a need for a more personalized approach toward drug development and diagnosis that takes into account the diversity of cancer patients, as well as the complex milieu of tumor cells within a single patient. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems paired with patient-derived xenografts or patient-derived organoids may provide a more clinically relevant system to address issues presented by personalized or precision medical approaches. In this review, we cover the current methods available for applying 3D culture systems toward personalized cancer research and drug development, as well as key challenges that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of 3D patient-derived culture systems for cancer drug development. Greater implementation of 3D patient-derived culture systems in the cancer research field should accelerate the development of truly personalized medical therapies for cancer patients.	
33238461        	Ex Vivo Culture Models to Indicate Therapy Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.            	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterized by a poor 5 year survival and varying response rates to both standard-of-care and new treatments. Despite advances in medicine and treatment methods, mortality rates have hardly decreased in recent decades. Reliable patient-derived tumor models offer the chance to predict therapy response in a personalized setting, thereby improving treatment efficacy by identifying the most appropriate treatment regimen for each patient. Furthermore, ex vivo tumor models enable testing of novel therapies before introduction in clinical practice. A literature search was performed to identify relevant literature describing three-dimensional ex vivo culture models of HNSCC to examine sensitivity to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy. We provide a comprehensive overview of the currently used three-dimensional ex vivo culture models for HNSCC with their advantages and limitations, including culture success percentage and comparison to the original tumor. Furthermore, we evaluate the potential of these models to predict patient therapy response.	
26192435        	Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors in Mice Deficient in Proglucagon-Derived Peptides.            	Animal models with defective glucagon action show hyperplasia of islet α-cells, however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the proliferation of islet endocrine cells remain largely to be elucidated. The Gcggfp/gfp mice, which are homozygous for glucagon/green fluorescent protein knock-in allele (GCGKO), lack all proglucagon-derived peptides including glucagon and GLP-1. The present study was aimed to characterize pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs), which develop in the GCGKO mice. At 15 months of age, macroscopic GFP-positive tumors were identified in the pancreas of all the GCGKO mice, but not in that of the control heterozygous mice. The tumor manifested several features that were consistent with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs), such as organoid structures with trabecular and cribriform patterns, and the expression of chromogranin A and synaptophysin. Dissemination of GFP-positive cells was observed in the liver and lungs in 100% and 95%, respectively, of 15-month-old GCGKO mice. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism for tumor growth, PanNET grafts were transplanted into subrenal capsules in GCGKO and control mice. Ki-67 positive cells were identified in panNET grafts transplanted to GCGKO mice 1 month after transplantation, but not in those to control mice. These results suggest that humoral factors or conditions specific to GCGKO mice, are involved in the proliferation of panNETs. Taken together, GCGKO mice are novel animal model for studying the development, pathogenesis, and metastasis panNETs.	
29598848        	Dual Transforming Growth Factor-β and Programmed Death-1 Blockade: A Strategy for Immune-Excluded Tumors?            	Tumors that elude infiltration by CD8+ T lymphocytes are particularly resistant to multiple forms of treatment, including immune checkpoint blockade. Stromal transforming growth factor (TGF)-β appears to play a key role in this process, potentially constituting a target for novel combinatorial regimens tackling immune-excluded neoplasms.

33572835        	Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma: Current Strategies and Challenges in Tumor Model Development.            	Glioblastoma is the most common brain malignant tumor in the adult population, and immunotherapy is playing an increasingly central role in the treatment of many cancers. Nevertheless, the search for effective immunotherapeutic approaches for glioblastoma patients continues. The goal of immunotherapy is to promote tumor eradication, boost the patient's innate and adaptive immune responses, and overcome tumor immune resistance. A range of new, promising immunotherapeutic strategies has been applied for glioblastoma, including vaccines, oncolytic viruses, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and adoptive cell transfer. However, the main challenges of immunotherapy for glioblastoma are the intracranial location and heterogeneity of the tumor as well as the unique, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Owing to the lack of appropriate tumor models, there are discrepancies in the efficiency of various immunotherapeutic strategies between preclinical studies (with in vitro and animal models) on the one hand and clinical studies (on humans) on the other hand. In this review, we summarize the glioblastoma characteristics that drive tolerance to immunotherapy, the currently used immunotherapeutic approaches against glioblastoma, and the most suitable tumor models to mimic conditions in glioblastoma patients. These models are improving and can more precisely predict patients' responses to immunotherapeutic treatments, either alone or in combination with standard treatment.	
26999503        	Biphasic Squamoid Alveolar Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Distinctive Subtype of Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma?            	Biphasic squamoid alveolar renal cell carcinoma (BSARCC) has been recently described as a distinct neoplasm. Twenty-one cases from 12 institutions were analyzed using routine histology, immunohistochemistry, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Tumors were removed from 11 male and 10 female patients, whose age ranged from 53 to 79 years. The size of tumors ranged from 1.5 to 16 cm. Follow-up information was available for 14 patients (range, 1 to 96 mo), and metastatic spread was found in 5 cases. All tumors comprised 2 cell populations arranged in organoid structures: small, low-grade neoplastic cells with scant cytoplasm usually lining the inside of alveolar structures, and larger squamoid cells with more prominent cytoplasm and larger vesicular nuclei arranged in compact nests. In 9/21 tumors there was a visible transition from such solid and alveolar areas into papillary components. Areas composed of large squamoid cells comprised 10% to 80% of total tumor volume. Emperipolesis was present in all (21/21) tumors. Immunohistochemically, all cases were positive for cytokeratin 7, EMA, vimentin, and cyclin D1. aCGH (confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization) in 5 analyzable cases revealed multiple numerical chromosomal changes including gains of chromosomes 7 and 17 in all cases. These changes were further disclosed in 6 additional cases, which were unsuitable for aCGH. We conclude that tumors show a morphologic spectrum ranging from RCC with papillary architecture and large squamoid cells to fully developed BSARCC. Emperipolesis in squamoid cells was a constant finding. All BSARCCs expressed CK7, EMA, vimentin, and cyclin D1. Antibody to cyclin D1 showed a unique and previously not recognized pattern of immunohistochemical staining. Multiple chromosomal aberrations were identified in all analyzable cases including gains of chromosomes 7 and 17, indicating that they are akin to papillary RCC. Some BSARCCs were clinically aggressive, but their prognosis could not be predicted from currently available data. Present microscopic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic data strongly support the view that BSARCC is a distinctive and peculiar morphologic variant of papillary RCC.	
33037203        	The ALPK1/TIFA/NF-κB axis links a bacterial carcinogen to R-loop-induced replication stress.            	Exposure of gastric epithelial cells to the bacterial carcinogen Helicobacter pylori causes DNA double strand breaks. Here, we show that H. pylori-induced DNA damage occurs co-transcriptionally in S-phase cells that activate NF-κB signaling upon innate immune recognition of the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic intermediate β-ADP-heptose by the ALPK1/TIFA signaling pathway. DNA damage depends on the bi-functional RfaE enzyme and the Cag pathogenicity island of H. pylori, is accompanied by replication fork stalling and can be observed also in primary cells derived from gastric organoids. Importantly, H. pylori-induced replication stress and DNA damage depend on the presence of co-transcriptional RNA/DNA hybrids (R-loops) that form in infected cells during S-phase as a consequence of β-ADP-heptose/ ALPK1/TIFA/NF-κB signaling. H. pylori resides in close proximity to S-phase cells in the gastric mucosa of gastritis patients. Taken together, our results link bacterial infection and NF-κB-driven innate immune responses to R-loop-dependent replication stress and DNA damage.	
33077751        	Anti-GD2-IRDye800CW as a targeted probe for fluorescence-guided surgery in neuroblastoma.            	Neuroblastoma resection represents a major challenge in pediatric surgery, because of the high risk of complications. Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) could lower this risk by facilitating discrimination of tumor from normal tissue and is gaining momentum in adult oncology. Here, we provide the first molecular-targeted fluorescent agent for FGS in pediatric oncology, by developing and preclinically evaluating a GD2-specific tracer consisting of the immunotherapeutic antibody dinutuximab-beta, recently approved for neuroblastoma treatment, conjugated to near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye IRDye800CW. We demonstrated specific binding of anti-GD2-IRDye800CW to human neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo using xenograft mouse models. Furthermore, we defined an optimal dose of 1 nmol, an imaging time window of 4 days after administration and show that neoadjuvant treatment with anti-GD2 immunotherapy does not interfere with fluorescence imaging. Importantly, as we observed universal, yet heterogeneous expression of GD2 on neuroblastoma tissue of a wide range of patients, we implemented a xenograft model of patient-derived neuroblastoma organoids with differential GD2 expression and show that even low GD2 expressing tumors still provide an adequate real-time fluorescence signal. Hence, the imaging advancement presented in this study offers an opportunity for improving surgery and potentially survival of a broad group of children with neuroblastoma.	
32170938        	Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated From Korean Kimchi Activate the Vitamin D Receptor-autophagy Signaling Pathways.            	Probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been used in the anti-inflammation and anti-infection process of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays an essential role in pathogenesis of IBD and infectious diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that the human VDR gene is a key host factor to shape gut microbiome. Furthermore, intestinal epithelial VDR conditional knockout (VDRΔIEC) leads to dysbiosis. Low expressions of VDR is associated with impaired autophagy, accompanied by a reduction of ATG16L1 and LC3B. The purpose of this study is to investigate probiotic effects and mechanism in modulating the VDR-autophagy pathways.                Five LAB strains were isolated from Korean kimchi. Conditional medium (CM) from these strains was used to treat a human cell line HCT116 or intestinal organoids to measure the expression of VDR and autophagy. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells with or without VDR were used to investigate the dependence on the VDR signaling. To test the role of LAB in anti-inflammation, VDR+/+ organoids were treated with 121-CM before infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. In vivo, the role of LAB in regulating VDR-autophagy signaling was examined using LAB 121-CM orally administrated to VDRLoxp and VDRΔIEC mice.                The LAB-CM-treated groups showed higher mRNA expression of VDR and its target genes cathelicidin compared with the control group. LAB treatment also enhanced expressions of Beclin-1 and ATG16L1 and changed the ratio of LC3B I and II, indicating the activation of autophagic responses. Furthermore, 121-CM treatment before Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis infection dramatically increased VDR and ATG16L1 and inhibited the inflammation. Administration of 121-CM to VDRLoxp and VDRΔIEC mice for 12 and 24 hours resulted in an increase of VDR and LC3B II:I ratio. Furthermore, we identified that probiotic proteins P40 and P75 in the LAB-CM contributed to the anti-inflammatory function by increasing VDR.                Probiotic LAB exert anti-inflammation activity and induces autophagy. These effects depend on the VDR expression. Our data highlight the beneficial effects of these 5 LAB strains isolated from food in anti-infection and anti-inflammation.                © 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

33099471        	Deletion of Histone Methyltransferase G9a Suppresses Mutant Kras-driven Pancreatic Carcinogenesis.            	The entire mechanisms by which epigenetic modifiers contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer remain unknown. Although the histone methyltransferase G9a is a promising target in human cancers, its role in pancreatic carcinogenesis has been under-studied. The aim of the study was to examine the role of G9a in pancreatic carcinogenesis by a gene-targeting mouse model.                We established pancreas-specific G9aflox/flox mice and crossed them with Ptf1aCre/; KrasG12D/+ (KC) mice, which spontaneously develop pancreatic cancer. The phenotypes of the resulting KC mice with G9a deletion were examined. We analyzed transcriptomic data by microarray and genome-wide chromatin accessibility by transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing. We established pancreatic organoids from KC mice.                G9a deficiency impaired the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and prolonged the survival of KC mice. The number of phosphorylated Erk-positive cells and Dclk1-positive cells, which are reported to be essential for the progression of PanIN, were decreased by G9a deletion. UNC0638, an inhibitor of G9a, suppressed the growth of organoids and increased global chromatin accessibility, especially around the regions including the protein phosphatase 2A genes.                Thus, our study suggested the functional interaction of G9a, Dclk1 and Mapk pathway in the Kras-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis. The inhibition of G9a may suppress the initiation of oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis.                Copyright© 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

26364610        	The HSP90 inhibitor, 17AAG, protects the intestinal stem cell niche and inhibits graft versus host disease development.            	Graft versus host disease (GvHD), which is the primary complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, can alter the intestinal barrier targeted by activated donor T-cells. Chemical inhibition of the stress protein HSP90 was demonstrated in vitro to inhibit T-cell activation and to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to which intestinal cells are highly susceptible. Since the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) is developed in clinics, we explored here its ability to control intestinal acute GvHD in vivo in two mouse GvHD models (C57BL/6BALB/c and FVB/NLgr5-eGFP), ex vivo in intestine organoids and in vitro in intestinal epithelial cultures. We show that 17AAG decreases GvHD-associated mortality without impairing graft versus leukemia effect. While 17AAG effect in T-cell activation is just moderate at the dose used in vivo, we observe a striking intestinal integrity protection. At the intestine level, the drug promotes the splicing of the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), which is a key component of the ER stress. This effect is associated with a decrease in intestinal damage and an increase in Lgr5(+) stem cells, Paneth cells and defensins production. The importance of XBP1 splicing control is further confirmed in cultured cells and organoids of primary intestinal epithelium where XBP1 is either shRNA depleted or inhibited with toyocamycin. In conclusion, 17AAG has a protective effect on the epithelial intestinal barrier in mouse models of acute GvHD. This compound deserves to be tested in the therapeutic control of acute GvHD.	
33081568        	Complete inhibition of ABCB1 and ABCG2 at the blood-brain barrier by co-infusion of erlotinib and tariquidar to improve brain delivery of the model ABCB1/ABCG2 substrate [11C]erlotinib.            	P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) restrict at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) the brain distribution of the majority of currently known molecularly targeted anticancer drugs. To improve brain delivery of dual ABCB1/ABCG2 substrates, both ABCB1 and ABCG2 need to be inhibited simultaneously at the BBB. We examined the feasibility of simultaneous ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibition with i.v. co-infusion of erlotinib and tariquidar by studying brain distribution of the model ABCB1/ABCG2 substrate [11C]erlotinib in mice and rhesus macaques with PET. Tolerability of the erlotinib/tariquidar combination was assessed in human embryonic stem cell-derived cerebral organoids. In mice and macaques, baseline brain distribution of [11C]erlotinib was low (brain distribution volume, VT,brain < 0.3 mL/cm3). Co-infusion of erlotinib and tariquidar increased VT,brain in mice by 3.0-fold and in macaques by 3.4- to 5.0-fold, while infusion of erlotinib alone or tariquidar alone led to less pronounced VT,brain increases in both species. Treatment of cerebral organoids with erlotinib/tariquidar led to an induction of Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Co-infusion of erlotinib/tariquidar may potentially allow for complete ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibition at the BBB, while simultaneously achieving brain-targeted EGFR inhibition. Our protocol may be applicable to enhance brain delivery of molecularly targeted anticancer drugs for a more effective treatment of brain tumors.	
27038684        	Giant intra-abdominal mature cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst) in an adult man, with male genitourinary tissue including prostatic and penile elements.            	We describe a case of a giant intra-abdominal mature cystic teratoma in a 36-year-old man, which comprised typical features of differentiated teratoma/dermoid cyst but which contained a macroscopic rudimentary penis, with vasoformative erectile tissue-like structures consistent with corpora cavernosa, as well as scrotal-type skin and prostatic tissue. The genitourinary structures were well formed both grossly and microscopically and sharply demarcated from the rest of the neoplasm, which comprised typical differentiated teratoma, without any other macroscopic foci of organoid differentiation or of other histologic differentiation. The plasticity of the cells of differentiated teratoma, which enables it to undergo multidirectional differentiation, is well recognized, but the factors determining this distinct path of differentiation remain to be established.

30632466        	Three-Dimensional Culture of Salivary Gland Stem Cell in Orthotropic Decellularized Extracellular Matrix Hydrogels.            	Radiotherapy in patients with cancer can kill cancer cells but also damage normal cells or tissues. During the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer or thyroid cancer, hyposalivation is a representative chronic side effect of radio-damaged salivary glands (SGs). The major symptom of hyposalivation is mouth dryness, resulting in several subsequent long-term complications. No effective therapeutic approaches have been developed to manage this symptom. In this study, we developed the first rat SG tissue-derived decellularized extracellular matrix hydrogel (DSGM-hydrogel) as a functional orthotropic bioscaffold for future efficient SG stem cell therapy. DSGM-hydrogels were characterized by rheological or biochemical analyses, and rat SG stem/progenitor cells (rSGSCs) were then subjected to three-dimensional culture in the DSGM-hydrogels. Interestingly, DSGM-hydrogel-embedded rSGSCs survived and expressed SG functional differentiation marker of amylase IA and increased enzyme activity of α-amylase in protein level, whereas they showed reduced levels of adult ductal stem/progenitor markers, including c-Kit, c-Met, and CD44. Furthermore, the expression levels of basic epithelial tight junction markers were recovered to levels similar to those naked SG tissues after culture in DSGM-hydrogels in transcription level. Therefore, our findings suggested that the DSGM-hydrogels could provide an appropriate microenvironment for stem/progenitor cell survival and a source of SG cytodifferentiation. This approach could be an applicable method to SG stem cell research as a potential source for an organoid and for clinical regenerative reagents to manage radio-damaged SGs in vivo. Impact Statement In this study, we established the first rat salivary gland (SG) tissue-derived decellularized extracellular matrix hydrogel (DSGM-hydrogel) and assessed the role of this hydrogel as a functional orthotropic bioscaffold. Our findings provide important insights into the applications of the DSGM-hydrogel as a biocompatible matrix for regenerative therapy of radio-damaged SGs.	
24122295        	Tropism of the in situ growth from biopsies of childhood neuroectodermal tumors following transplantation into experimental teratoma.            	Experimental teratoma induced from human pluripotent stem cells with normal karyotype can be described as a failed embryonic process and includes besides advanced organoid development also large elements of tissue with a prolonged occurrence of immature neural components. Such immature components, although benign, exhibit strong morphological resemblance with tumors of embryonic neuroectodermal origin. Here, we demonstrate that biopsy material from childhood tumors of neural embryonic origin transplanted to mature experimental teratoma can show an exclusive preference for matching tissue. Tumor specimens from five children with; Supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (sPNET); Pilocytic astrocytoma of the brainstem; Classic medulloblastoma; peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) or neuroblastoma (NB), respectively, were transplanted. Analysis of up to 120 sections of each tumor revealed an engraftment for three of the transplanted tumors: pPNET, sPNET, and NB, with a protruding growth from the latter two that were selected for detailed examination. The histology revealed a strict tropism with a non-random integration into what morphologically appeared as matched embryonic microenvironment recuperating the patient tumor histology. The findings suggest specific advantages over xenotransplantation and lead us to propose that transplantation to the human embryonic microenvironment in experimental teratoma can be a well-needed complement for preclinical in vivo studies of childhood neuroectodermal tumors.                 © 2013 UICC.	
26760686        	Infundibulocystic Structures and Prominent Squamous Metaplasia in Sebaceoma-A Rare Feature. A Clinicopathologic Study of 10 Cases.            	The authors describe 10 cases of sebaceoma that manifested prominent infundibulocystic structures in all cases and, additionally, conspicuous squamous metaplasia in 6 neoplasms. All tumors occurred on the scalp or the face (2 cases lacked clinical information) and presented as a solitary lesion, measuring from 5 to 20 mm. The patients' age ranged from 22 to 89 years. The main component of all tumors was small, uniform basaloid cells (immature sebocytes) intermixed with mature sebocytes clearly arranged in nodules, classifying the lesions as a sebaceoma. In all neoplasms, the tumor cells showed organoid growth patterns of sebaceoma, including rippled, sinusoidal/labyrinthine, and carcinoid-like, occurring alone or in combination. Additionally, numerous infundibulocystic structures were readily noticed and were either distributed multifocally or unilocular within the tumors. In some cases, they were segregated from the main tumor bulk. The authors posit that these structures, which are different from both sebaceous ductal differentiation and squamous metaplasia, represent an authentic follicular differentiation. The infundibulocystic features (combined with squamous metaplasia), when prominent and in a limited biopsy specimen, may cause a confusion with trichoadenoma or even microcystic adnexal carcinoma.	
33213345        	Genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9: A budding biological contrivance for colorectal carcinoma research and its perspective in molecular medicine.            	Genome editing is an addition, deletion, or replacement of a gene for wiping out or initiating explicit and preferred characters in the genome. Utilizing gene editing tools like CRISPR-Cas9 technology could be accomplished either by gene-based methodology or protein based technology that has been under scrutiny for protracted time wherein physical techniques, viral and non-viral strategies have been utilized together. Transplanting ex vivo CRISPR edited cells empowers screening of single guide RNAs with high-throughput and CRISPR based screening in organoids transplantation to validate cancer cells including colorectal carcinoma in various phases of its development and treatment. CRISPR knockout screens have recognized genes driving an interest in the colon cancer develop hallmarks, outstandingly for the disclosure of drug resistance mechanism in some cancer cell lines with single guide RNA. A benefit of this approach is to deal with genomic screening of CRISPR knockout, disrupts gene expression, rather than the partial knockdown which are frequently accomplished with RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas technology. Due to its proficient editing of the target gene, along with CRISPR/Cas system, this technique is used in the treatment of diverse types of cancer. In recent time research showed that CRISPR/Cas gene editing tool potentially reformed expression of long non-coding RNA in colorectal carcinoma.

31818845        	Concomitant intraperitoneal and systemic chemotherapy for extensive peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin: protocol of the multicentre, open-label, phase I, dose-escalation INTERACT trial.            	Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) has become standard of care for patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin with a low/moderate abdominal disease load. In case of a peritoneal cancer index (PCI) score >20, CRS-HIPEC is not considered to be beneficial. Patients with a PCI >20 are currently offered palliative systemic chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown that systemic chemotherapy is less effective against peritoneal metastases than it is against haematogenous spread of colorectal cancer. It is suggested that patients with peritoneal metastases may benefit from the addition of intraperitoneal chemotherapy to systemic chemotherapy. Aim of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal irinotecan, added to standard of care systemic therapy for colorectal cancer. Secondary endpoints are to determine the safety and feasibility of this treatment and to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of intraperitoneally administered irinotecan.                This phase I, '3+3' dose-escalation, study is performed in two Dutch tertiary referral centres. The study population consists of adult patients with extensive peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin who have a good performance status and no extra-abdominal metastases. According to standard work-up for CRS-HIPEC, patients will undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy to score the PCI. In case of a PCI >20, a peritoneal access port will be placed in the abdomen of the patient. Through this port we will administer intraperitoneal irinotecan, in combination with standard systemic treatment consisting of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with oxaliplatin and the targeted agent bevacizumab. Therapy consists of a maximum of 12 cycles 2-weekly.                This study protocol is approved by a research medical ethics committee (Rotterdam, Netherlands) and the Dutch Competent Authority (CCMO, The Hague, Netherlands). The results of this trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

29237753        	Troy/TNFRSF19 marks epithelial progenitor cells during mouse kidney development that continue to contribute to turnover in adult kidney.            	During kidney development, progressively committed progenitor cells give rise to the distinct segments of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney. Similar segment-committed progenitor cells are thought to be involved in the homeostasis of adult kidney. However, markers for most segment-committed progenitor cells remain to be identified. Here, we evaluate Troy/TNFRSF19 as a segment-committed nephron progenitor cell marker. Troy is expressed in the ureteric bud during embryonic development. During postnatal nephrogenesis, Troy+ cells are present in the cortex and papilla and display an immature tubular phenotype. Tracing of Troy+ cells during nephrogenesis demonstrates that Troy+ cells clonally give rise to tubular structures that persist for up to 2 y after induction. Troy+ cells have a 40-fold higher capacity than Troy- cells to form organoids, which is considered a stem cell property in vitro. In the adult kidney, Troy+ cells are present in the papilla and these cells continue to contribute to collecting duct formation during homeostasis. The number of Troy-derived cells increases after folic acid-induced injury. Our data show that Troy marks a renal stem/progenitor cell population in the developing kidney that in adult kidney contributes to homeostasis, predominantly of the collecting duct, and regeneration.

32923839        	Targeted Inhibition of Purine Metabolism Is Effective in Suppressing Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression.            	Tumor-specific metabolic rewiring, acquired to confer a proliferative and survival advantage over nontransformed cells, represents a renewed focus in cancer therapy development. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a malignancy that has hitherto been resistant to compounds targeting oncogenic signaling pathways, represents a candidate cancer to investigate the efficacy of selectively antagonizing such adaptive metabolic reprogramming. To this end, we sought to characterize metabolic changes in HCC necessary for tumorigenesis. We analyzed gene expression profiles in three independent large-scale patient cohorts who had HCC. We identified a commonly deregulated purine metabolic signature in tumors with the extent of purine biosynthetic enzyme up-regulation correlated with tumor grade and a predictor of clinical outcome. The functional significance of enhanced purine metabolism as a hallmark in human HCC was then validated using a combination of HCC cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) organoids, and mouse models. Targeted ablation of purine biosynthesis by knockdown of the rate-limiting enzyme inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) or using the drug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) reduced HCC proliferation in vitro and decreased the tumor burden in vivo. In comparing the sensitivities of PDX tumor organoids to MMF therapy, we found that HCC tumors defined by high levels of IMPDH and guanosine nucleosides were most susceptible to treatment. Mechanistically, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) axis coordinated purine biosynthetic enzyme expression, deregulation of which altered the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase/RAS signaling. Simultaneously abolishing PI3K signaling and IMPDH activity with clinically approved inhibitors resulted in greatest efficacy in reducing tumor growth in a PDX mouse model. Conclusion: Enhanced purine metabolic activity regulated by PI3K pathway-dependent activation of E2F1 promotes HCC carcinogenesis, suggesting the potential for targeting purine metabolic reprogramming as a precision therapeutic strategy for patients with HCC.                © 2020 The Authors.

24144042        	Regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by Wnt and Notch are conserved throughout the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in the colon.            	Colon cancer stem cells are shown to be the self-renewing cells within a tumor that give rise to all lineages of more differentiated tumor cells. In this respect they are remarkably similar to their non-malignant counterparts that orchestrate the intestinal lining. This suggests that, despite the numerous genetic aberrations and morphological changes that have occurred during cancer initiation and progression, a remnant homeostatic regulation persists.                Using a number of human and mouse intestinal-derived organoid cultures from normal, adenoma and cancerous tissues, we show here that Notch signals coordinate self-renewal and lineage determination not only in normal, but also at the adenoma and carcinoma stage in both mice and humans. Moreover, the Wnt pathway, which carries activating mutations in virtually all colon cancers, is not as previously predicted constitutively active in adenomas and carcinomas, but still displays a heterogeneous activity pattern that determined stemness in all stages of disease.                These data for the first time provide a comprehensive overview of Wnt and Notch-mediated signaling in the different stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and demonstrates that these morphogenic pathways, despite mutations, remain crucial determinants of both architecture and hierarchy in normal and malignant intestinal tissue.	
33292639        	Protein synthesis inhibitors stimulate MondoA transcriptional activity by driving an accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate.            	Protein synthesis is regulated by the availability of amino acids, the engagement of growth factor signaling pathways, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels sufficient to support translation. Crosstalk between these inputs is extensive, yet other regulatory mechanisms remain to be characterized. For example, the translation initiation inhibitor rocaglamide A (RocA) induces thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). TXNIP is a negative regulator of glucose uptake; thus, its induction by RocA links translation to the availability of glucose. MondoA is the principal regulator of glucose-induced transcription, and its activity is triggered by the glycolytic intermediate, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). MondoA responds to G6P generated by cytoplasmic glucose and mitochondrial ATP (mtATP), suggesting a critical role in the cellular response to these energy sources. TXNIP expression is entirely dependent on MondoA; therefore, we investigated how protein synthesis inhibitors impact its transcriptional activity.                We investigated how translation regulates MondoA activity using cell line models and loss-of-function approaches. We examined how protein synthesis inhibitors effect gene expression and metabolism using RNA-sequencing and metabolomics, respectively. The biological impact of RocA was evaluated using cell lines and patient-derived xenograft organoid (PDxO) models.                We discovered that multiple protein synthesis inhibitors, including RocA, increase TXNIP expression in a manner that depends on MondoA, a functional electron transport chain and mtATP synthesis. Furthermore, RocA and cycloheximide increase mtATP and G6P levels, respectively, and TXNIP induction depends on interactions between the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and hexokinase (HK), which generates G6P. RocA treatment impacts the regulation of ~ 1200 genes, and ~ 250 of those genes are MondoA-dependent. RocA treatment is cytotoxic to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and shows preferential cytotoxicity against estrogen receptor negative (ER-) PDxO breast cancer models. Finally, RocA-driven cytotoxicity is partially dependent on MondoA or TXNIP.                Our data suggest that protein synthesis inhibitors rewire metabolism, resulting in an increase in mtATP and G6P, the latter driving MondoA-dependent transcriptional activity. Further, MondoA is a critical component of the cellular transcriptional response to RocA. Our functional assays suggest that RocA or similar translation inhibitors may show efficacy against ER- breast tumors and that the levels of MondoA and TXNIP should be considered when exploring these potential treatment options.	
28467911        	The Induction of Selected Wnt Target Genes by Tcf1 Mediates Generation of Tumorigenic Colon Stem Cells.            	The generation of tumor-initiating cells during colon carcinogenesis is associated with the dysregulation of Wnt signaling, which is known to act on Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cells. Here, using single-cell qPCR analysis, we identified a subset of Lgr5-positive stem cells that emerged during tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colon cancer. These tumor-specific Lgr5-positive cells expressed low levels of Ceacam1 and increased levels of a specific subset of Wnt targets and showed enhanced tumorigenicity. Among the Wnt targets that were specifically expressed, the long isoform of Tcf1 was required for the proliferation of tumor organoids and drove a unique Wnt target gene expression profile. Tcf1 expression increased at an early stage of colon carcinogenesis and was associated with the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, underscoring the importance of the induction of Tcf1 expression in generating tumorigenic colon stem cells.

28414305        	SPOP regulates prostate epithelial cell proliferation and promotes ubiquitination and turnover of c-MYC oncoprotein.            	The E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is frequently dysregulated in prostate adenocarcinoma (PC), via either somatic mutations or mRNA downregulation, suggesting an important tumour suppressor function. To examine its physiologic role in the prostate epithelium in vivo, we generated mice with prostate-specific biallelic ablation of Spop. These mice exhibited increased prostate mass, prostate epithelial cell proliferation, and expression of c-MYC protein compared to littermate controls, and eventually developed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). We found that SPOPWT can physically interact with c-MYC protein and, upon exogenous expression in vitro, can promote c-MYC ubiquitination and degradation. This effect was attenuated in PC cells by introducing PC-associated SPOP mutants or upon knockdown of SPOP via short-hairpin-RNA, suggesting that SPOP inactivation directly increases c-MYC protein levels. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed enrichment of Myc-induced genes in transcriptomic signatures associated with SPOPMT. Likewise, we observed strong inverse correlation between c-MYC activity and SPOP mRNA levels in two independent PC patient cohorts. The core SPOPMT;MYCHigh transcriptomic response, defined by the overlap between the SPOPMT and c-MYC transcriptomic programmes, was also associated with inferior clinical outcome in human PCs. Finally, the organoid-forming capacity of Spop-null murine prostate cells was more sensitive to c-MYC inhibition than that of Spop-WT cells, suggesting that c-MYC upregulation functionally contributes to the proliferative phenotype of Spop knock-out prostates. Taken together, our data highlight SPOP as an important regulator of luminal epithelial cell proliferation and c-MYC expression in prostate physiology, identify c-MYC as a novel bona fide SPOP substrate, and help explain the frequent inactivation of SPOP in human PC. We propose SPOPMT-induced stabilization of c-MYC protein as a novel mechanism that can increase total c-MYC levels in PC cells, in addition to amplification of c-MYC locus.	
32478869        	Identifying predictors of HPV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression and survival through patient-derived models.            	Therapeutic innovation for human papilloma virus-related (HPV+) head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) is impaired by inadequate preclinical models and the absence of accurate biomarkers. Our study establishes the first well-characterized panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids from HPV+ HNSCCs while determining fidelity of the models to the distinguishing genetic features of this cancer type. Despite low engraftment rates, whole exome sequencing showed that PDXs retain multiple distinguishing features of HPV+ HNSCC lost in existing cell lines, including PIK3CA mutations, TRAF3 deletion and the absence of EGFR amplifications. Engrafted HPV+ tumors frequently contained NOTCH1 mutations, thus providing new models for a negatively prognostic alteration in this disease. Genotype-phenotype associations in the models were then tested for prediction of tumor progression and survival in published clinical cohorts. Observation of high tumor mutational burdens (TMBs) in the faster-growing models facilitated identification of a novel association between TMB and local progression in both HPV+ and HPV- patients that was prognostic in HPV- cases. In addition, reduced E7 and p16INK4A levels found in a PDX from an outlier case with lethal outcome led to detection of similar profiles among recurrent HPV+ HNSCCs. Transcriptional data from the Cancer Genome Atlas was used to demonstrate that the lower E2F target gene expression predicted by reduced E7 levels has potential as a biomarker of disease recurrence risk. Our findings bridge a critical gap in preclinical models for HPV+ HNSCCs and simultaneously reveal novel potential applications of quantifying mutational burden and viral oncogene functions for biomarker development.                © 2020 UICC.	
25841948        	Simultaneous occurrence of two squamous cell carcinomas developing in a nevus sebaceous.            	Nevus sebaceous (NS), also known as organoid nevus, is a congenital skin hamartoma involving pilosebaceous follicle, epidermis and adnexal structures, which usually occurs in the head and neck region. During the first stage, which is seen in infancy and childhood, the lesion remains static, but can subsequently grow during puberty to become more evident and verrucous or nodular. Depending on the location and extent, nevus sebaceous causes only a cosmetic problem during childhood; however, the development of benign and malignant neoplasms on the lesion is the most severe complication during adulthood. The association between nevus sebaceous and various benign and malignant cutaneous neoplasms is well documented. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant lesion, and syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SP) is the most common benign tumor associated with nevus sebaceous. Development of squamous cell carcinoma within NS is very rare. The literature contains only a few reports of simultaneous multiple malignant tumors developing on nevus sebaceous. We present a review of the literature and report the case of a 42-year-old female patient with two squamous-cell carcinomas (SCC) simultaneously within a single NS.	
32402291        	In Vivo Cell Fate Tracing Provides No Evidence for Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition in Adult Fallopian Tube and Uterus.            	The mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) is thought to be involved in the maintenance, repair, and carcinogenesis of the fallopian tube (oviduct) and uterine epithelium. However, conclusive evidence for the conversion of mesenchymal cells to epithelial cells in these organs is lacking. Using embryonal cell lineage tracing with reporters driven by mesenchymal cell marker genes of the female reproductive tract (AMHR2, CSPG4, and PDGFRβ), we show that these reporters are also expressed by some oviductal and uterine epithelial cells at birth. These mesenchymal reporter-positive epithelial cells are maintained in adult mice across multiple pregnancies, respond to ovarian hormones, and form organoids. However, no labeled epithelial cells are present in any oviductal or uterine epithelia when mesenchymal cell labeling was induced in adult mice. Organoids developed from mice labeled in adulthood were also negative for mesenchymal reporters. Collectively, our work found no definitive evidence of MET in the adult fallopian tube and uterine epithelium.                Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

30001241        	Pulmonary Carcinomas With Mucinous and Neuroendocrine Differentiation: Expanding the Spectrum of Amphicrine Carcinomas.            	Amphicrine carcinoma is a distinct type of carcinoma characterized by synchronous exocrine and endocrine differentiation within the same tumor cell. Such tumors are exceedingly rare and most commonly recognized in the gastrointestinal tract. In the lung, sporadic descriptions of such lesions exist. This report presents 3 more such tumors, expanding the spectrum of amphicrine carcinomas in this organ. The patients were 3 men, 53 to 78 years of age (mean: 63 y) and all were current or former smokers. In one patient the tumor was an incidental finding, the others presented with lower respiratory symptoms. Microscopically, the lesions had an organoid pattern, consisting of nests of large tumor cells with peripheral palisading, vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli reminiscent of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. In addition, the tumor nests also showed glandular features, characterized by gland-like lumina filled with mucin and intracytoplasmic mucin droplets. Immunohistochemical studies showed diffuse reactivity of the tumor cells with synaptophysin and chromogranin and variable reactivity with TTF-1. Mucin stains highlighted extracellular and intracellular mucin deposition. Clinical follow-up demonstrated that one patient had died of his disease 12 months after surgery while another was alive and free of disease 21 months after surgery. The third patient was alive with widespread metastatic disease 8 months after diagnosis. This series highlights a rare variant of pulmonary carcinoma showing synchronous exocrine and endocrine differentiation. Recognition of this type of tumor is important in terms of tumor classification and to identify an entity with potential aggressive behavior.	
27733182        	An Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma with SMARCB1 (INI1) inactivation in adult end-stage renal disease: a case report.            	Xp11.2 translocation/transcription factor E3 (TFE3) rearrangement renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare subtype of RCC with limited clinical and pathological data.                Here we present an unusual high-grade Xp11.2 translocation RCC with a rhabdoid feature and SMARCB1 (INI1) inactivation in a 40-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease. The histological examination of the dissected left renal tumor showed an organoid architecture of the eosinophilic or clear neoplastic cells with necrosis and high mitotic activity. In some areas, non-adhesive tumor cells with eccentric nuclei were observed. Immunohistochemically (IHC), the tumor cells are positive for TFE3 and the renal tubular markers (PAX2 and PAX8), and completely negative for SMARCB1, an oncosuppressor protein. Break-apart florescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed TFE3 rearrangement on Xp11.2 and the presence of ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion gene. DNA sequencing revealed a frameshift mutation in exon 4 of SMARCB1 gene.                It is important to recognize this rare RCC with both TFE3 rearrangement and SMARCB1 inactivation, as the prognosis and therapeutic strategies, particularly targeted therapies for such tumors, might be different.	
32372448        	UHRF2 promotes intestinal tumorigenesis through stabilization of TCF4 mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling.            	Intestinal tumors mainly originate from transformed crypt stem cells supported by Wnt signaling, which functions through downstream critical factors enriched in the intestinal stem/progenitor compartment. Here, we show Uhrf2 is predominantly expressed in intestinal crypts and adenomas in mice and is transcriptionally regulated by Wnt signaling. Upregulated UHRF2 correlates with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Although loss of Uhrf2 did not affect intestinal homeostasis and regeneration, tumor initiation and progression were inhibited, leading to a markedly prolonged life span in Uhrf2 null mice on an ApcMin background. Uhrf2 deficiency also strongly reduced primary tumor organoid formation suggesting impairment of tumor stem cells. Moreover, ablation of Uhrf2 suppressed tumor cell proliferation through downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Mechanistically, Uhrf2 directly interacts with and sumoylates Tcf4, a critical intranuclear effector of the Wnt pathway. Uhrf2 mediated SUMOylation stabilized Tcf4 and further sustained hyperactive Wnt signaling. Together, we demonstrate that Wnt-induced Uhrf2 expression promotes tumorigenesis through modulation of the stability of Tcf4 for maintaining oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This is a new reciprocal feedforward regulation between Uhrf2 and Wnt signaling in tumor initiation and progression.                © 2020 UICC.	
31540244        	Allosteric AKT Inhibitors Target Synthetic Lethal Vulnerabilities in E-Cadherin-Deficient Cells.            	The CDH1 gene, encoding the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin, is one of the most frequently mutated genes in gastric cancer and inactivating germline CDH1 mutations are responsible for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome (HDGC). Using cell viability assays, we identified that breast (MCF10A) and gastric (NCI-N87) cells lacking CDH1 expression are more sensitive to allosteric AKT inhibitors than their CDH1-expressing isogenic counterparts. Apoptosis priming and total apoptosis assays in the isogenic MCF10A cells confirmed the enhanced sensitivity of E-cadherin-null cells to the AKT inhibitors. In addition, two of these inhibitors, ARQ-092 and MK2206, preferentially targeted mouse-derived gastric Cdh1-/- organoids for growth arrest. AKT protein expression and activation (as measured by phosphorylation of serine 473) were differentially regulated in E-cadherin-null MCF10A and NCI-N87 cells, with downregulation in the normal breast cells, but upregulation in the gastric cancer cells. Bioinformatic analysis of the TCGA STAD dataset revealed that AKT3, but not AKT1 or AKT2, is upregulated in the majority of E-cadherin-deficient gastric cancers. In conclusion, allosteric AKT inhibitors represent a promising class of drugs for chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancers with E-cadherin loss.	
24141782        	Stromal matrix metalloproteinase-11 is involved in the mammary gland postnatal development.            	MMP-11 is a bad prognosis paracrine factor in invasive breast cancers. However, its mammary physiological function remains largely unknown. In the present study we have investigated MMP-11 function during postnatal mammary gland development and function using MMP-11-deficient (MMP-11-/-) mice. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses as well as whole-mount mammary gland staining show alteration of the mammary gland in the absence of MMP-11, where ductal tree, alveolar structures and milk production are reduced. Moreover, a series of transplantation experiments allowed us to demonstrate that MMP-11 exerts an essential local paracrine function that favors mammary gland branching and epithelial cell outgrowth and invasion through adjacent connective tissues. Indeed, MMP-11-/- cleared fat pads are not permissive for wild-type epithelium development, whereas MMP-11-/- epithelium transplants grow normally when implanted in wild-type cleared fat pads. In addition, using primary mammary epithelial organoids, we show in vitro that this MMP-11 pro-branching effect is not direct, suggesting that MMP-11 acts via production/release of stroma-associated soluble factor(s). Finally, the lack of MMP-11 leads to decreased periductal collagen content, suggesting that MMP-11 has a role in collagen homeostasis. Thus, local stromal MMP-11 might also regulate mammary epithelial cell behavior mechanically by promoting extracellular matrix stiffness. Collectively, the present data indicate that MMP-11 is a paracrine factor involved during postnatal mammary gland morphogenesis, and support the concept that the stroma strongly impact epithelial cell behavior. Interestingly, stromal MMP-11 has previously been reported to favor malignant epithelial cell survival and promote cancer aggressiveness. Thus, MMP-11 has a paracrine function during mammary gland development that might be harnessed to promote tumor progression, exposing a new link between development and malignancy.	
29805107        	Mouse Intestinal Krt15+ Crypt Cells Are Radio-Resistant and Tumor Initiating.            	Two principal stem cell pools orchestrate the rapid cell turnover in the intestinal epithelium. Rapidly cycling Lgr5+ stem cells are intercalated between the Paneth cells at the crypt base (CBCs) and injury-resistant reserve stem cells reside above the crypt base. The intermediate filament Keratin 15 (Krt15) marks either stem cells or long-lived progenitor cells that contribute to tissue repair in the hair follicle or the esophageal epithelium. Herein, we demonstrate that Krt15 labels long-lived and multipotent cells in the small intestinal crypt by lineage tracing. Krt15+ crypt cells display self-renewal potential in vivo and in 3D organoid cultures. Krt15+ crypt cells are resistant to high-dose radiation and contribute to epithelial regeneration following injury. Notably, loss of the tumor suppressor Apc in Krt15+ cells leads to adenoma and adenocarcinoma formation. These results indicate that Krt15 marks long-lived, multipotent, and injury-resistant crypt cells that may function as a cell of origin in intestinal cancer.

33619246        	HIF-1α-induced expression of m6A reader YTHDF1 drives hypoxia-induced autophagy and malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting ATG2A and ATG14 translation.            	N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and its reader protein YTHDF1, play a pivotal role in human tumorigenesis by affecting nearly every stage of RNA metabolism. Autophagy activation is one of the ways by which cancer cells survive hypoxia. However, the possible involvement of m6A modification of mRNA in hypoxia-induced autophagy was unexplored in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, specific variations in YTHDF1 expression were detected in YTHDF1-overexpressing, -knockout, and -knockdown HCC cells, HCC organoids, and HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) murine models. YTHDF1 expression and hypoxia-induced autophagy were significantly correlated in vitro; significant overexpression of YTHDF1 in HCC tissues was associated with poor prognosis. Multivariate cox regression analysis identified YTHDF1 expression as an independent prognostic factor in patients with HCC. Multiple HCC models confirmed that YTHDF1 deficiency inhibited HCC autophagy, growth, and metastasis. Luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that HIF-1α regulated YTHDF1 transcription by directly binding to its promoter region under hypoxia. The results of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, proteomics, and polysome profiling indicated that YTHDF1 contributed to the translation of autophagy-related genes ATG2A and ATG14 by binding to m6A-modified ATG2A and ATG14 mRNA, thus facilitating autophagy and autophagy-related malignancy of HCC. Taken together, HIF-1α-induced YTHDF1 expression was associated with hypoxia-induced autophagy and autophagy-related HCC progression via promoting translation of autophagy-related genes ATG2A and ATG14 in a m6A-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that YTHDF1 is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with HCC.	
33592587        	Stem cells basedin vitromodels: Trends and prospects in biomaterials cytotoxicity studies.            	Advanced biomaterials have produced a significant impact on healthcare by improving the quality of life of people with disabilities. Biomaterials are immensely used in tissue engineering, wound healing applications, and delivery of cancer targeted therapeutics. Biocompatibility and cytotoxicity screening of biomaterials on cell culture systems is the first step before their in vivo testing in animal models and subsequent clinical trials. Direct use of biomaterials on animals may create technical challenges as well as ethical concerns. In order to avoid the ethical concerns of animal use, many non-animal models such as stem cell cultures are being developed and utilized for testing their safety. However, due to several limitations including the inability to recapitulate the complex in vivo microenvironment, the application of stem cell cultures is limited. However, properties of stem cells such as their self-renewal and ability to differentiate into various cell lineages like hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, and neural cells make them an ideal candidates for in vitro screening studies. Furthermore, the application of stem cells may overcome the challenges associated with the inability to develop a complex heterogeneous tissue using primary cells. Currently, Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), Adult Stem Cells (ASCs), and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) are being used as in vitro preliminary biomaterials testing models with demonstrated advantages over mature primary cell or cell line based in vitro models. This review discusses the current status and future directions of in vitro stem cell-based cultures and their derivatives such as spheroids and organoids for the screening of their safety before their application to animal models and human in translational research.                © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.	
32386599        	Single-Cell Analysis of Human Retina Identifies Evolutionarily Conserved and Species-Specific Mechanisms Controlling Development.            	The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has allowed high-resolution analysis of cell-type diversity and transcriptional networks controlling cell-fate specification. To identify the transcriptional networks governing human retinal development, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on 16 time points from developing retina as well as four early stages of retinal organoid differentiation. We identified evolutionarily conserved patterns of gene expression during retinal progenitor maturation and specification of all seven major retinal cell types. Furthermore, we identified gene-expression differences between developing macula and periphery and between distinct populations of horizontal cells. We also identified species-specific patterns of gene expression during human and mouse retinal development. Finally, we identified an unexpected role for ATOH7 expression in regulation of photoreceptor specification during late retinogenesis. These results provide a roadmap to future studies of human retinal development and may help guide the design of cell-based therapies for treating retinal dystrophies.

32102440        	Antiparkinson Drug Benztropine Suppresses Tumor Growth, Circulating Tumor Cells, and Metastasis by Acting on SLC6A3/DAT and Reducing STAT3.            	Tumor growth, progression, and therapy resistance are crucial factors in the prognosis of cancer. The properties of three-dimensional (3D) tumor-like organoids (tumoroids) more closely resemble in vivo tumors compared to two-dimensionally cultured cells and are therefore effectively used for assays and drug screening. We here established a repurposed drug for novel anticancer research and therapeutics using a 3D tumoroid-based screening system. We screened six pharmacologically active compounds by using an original tumoroid-based multiplex phenotypic screening system with a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) promoter-driven fluorescence reporter for the evaluation of both tumoroid formation and progression. The antiparkinson drug benztropine was the most effective compound uncovered by the screen. Benztropine significantly inhibited in vitro tumoroid formation, cancer cell survival, and MMP9 promoter activity. Benztropine also reduced the activity of oncogenic signaling transducers and trans-activators for MMP9, including STAT3, NF-κB, and β-catenin, and the properties of cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells. Benztropine and GBR-12935 directly targeted the dopamine transporter DAT/SLC6A3, whose genetic alterations such as amplification were correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. Benztropine also inhibited the tumor growth, circulating tumor cell (CTC) number, and rate of metastasis in a tumor allograft model in mice. In conclusion, we propose the repurposing of benztropine for anticancer research and therapeutics that can suppress tumor progression, CTC, and metastasis of aggressive cancers by reducing key pro-tumorigenic factors.	
32312681        	Zebrafish Xenografts for Drug Discovery and Personalized Medicine.            	Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world. Given that cancer is a highly individualized disease, predicting the best chemotherapeutic treatment for individual patients can be difficult. Ex vivo models such as mouse patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and organoids are being developed to predict patient-specific chemosensitivity profiles before treatment in the clinic. Although promising, these models have significant disadvantages including long growth times that introduce genetic and epigenetic changes to the tumor. The zebrafish xenograft assay is ideal for personalized medicine. Imaging of the small, transparent fry is unparalleled among vertebrate organisms. In addition, the speed (5-7 days) and small patient tissue requirements (100-200 cells per animal) are unique features of the zebrafish xenograft model that enable patient-specific chemosensitivity analyses.

20674001        	The relationship between terminal functionalization and molecular weight of a gene delivery polymer and transfection efficacy in mammary epithelial 2-D cultures and 3-D organotypic cultures.            	Non-viral gene delivery vectors were developed for efficient gene transfer to hard-to-transfect mouse mammary epithelial cells. Ten modified versions of the same base poly(beta-amino ester), poly(1,4-butanediol diacrylate-co-5-amino-1-pentanol), were tested in both traditional 2-D monolayer and in 3-D organotypic cultures. The polymers self-assembled with plasmid DNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein to form nanoparticles (approximately 100 nm) used to transfect the cells. Nanoparticle transfection efficacy was tuned by changes in synthesis and fabrication conditions and the transfection efficacy was analyzed using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The best performing polymeric nanoparticles transfected 57 +/- 6% of the cells in 2-D culture and 6 +/- 1% of the cells in 3-D culture. Small modifications to the polymer end-capping molecules and tuning of polymer molecular weight could either significantly enhance the transfection efficacy up to 6-fold or instead abolish efficacy completely. The efficacy of leading polymers was higher than that of the commercial transfection agent FuGENE HD by a factor of 13 in 2-D and 2 in 3-D. These non-viral nanoparticles may be useful as delivery reagents or targeted therapeutics for breast cancer. This gene delivery strategy is also a promising approach for studying the normal development of the mammary gland.                Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	
30565891        	Quantitative Label-Free Imaging of 3D Vascular Networks Self-Assembled in Synthetic Hydrogels.            	Vascularization is an important strategy to overcome diffusion limits and enable the formation of complex, physiologically relevant engineered tissues and organoids. Self-assembly is a technique to generate in vitro vascular networks, but engineering the necessary network morphology and function remains challenging. Here, autofluorescence multiphoton microscopy (aMPM), a label-free imaging technique, is used to quantitatively evaluate in vitro vascular network morphology. Vascular networks are generated using human embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells and primary human pericytes encapsulated in synthetic poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels. Two custom-built bioreactors are used to generate distinct fluid flow patterns during vascular network formation: recirculating flow or continuous flow. aMPM is used to image these 3D vascular networks without the need for fixation, labels, or dyes. Image processing and analysis algorithms are developed to extract quantitative morphological parameters from these label-free images. It is observed with aMPM that both bioreactors promote formation of vascular networks with lower network anisotropy compared to static conditions, and the continuous flow bioreactor induces more branch points compared to static conditions. Importantly, these results agree with trends observed with immunocytochemistry. These studies demonstrate that aMPM allows label-free monitoring of vascular network morphology to streamline optimization of growth conditions and provide quality control of engineered tissues.                © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

27226307        	Growth hormone is permissive for neoplastic colon growth.            	Growth hormone (GH) excess in acromegaly is associated with increased precancerous colon polyps and soft tissue adenomas, whereas short-stature humans harboring an inactivating GH receptor mutation do not develop cancer. We show that locally expressed colon GH is abundant in conditions predisposing to colon cancer and in colon adenocarcinoma-associated stromal fibroblasts. Administration of a GH receptor (GHR) blocker in acromegaly patients induced colon p53 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), reversing progrowth GH signals. p53 was also induced in skin fibroblasts derived from short-statured humans with mutant GHR. GH-deficient prophet of pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1 (Prop1)(-/-) mice exhibited induced colon p53 levels, and cross-breeding them with Apc(min+/-) mice that normally develop intestinal and colon tumors resulted in GH-deficient double mutants with markedly decreased tumor number and size. We also demonstrate that GH suppresses p53 and reduces apoptosis in human colon cell lines as well as in induced human pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoids, and confirm in vivo that GH suppresses colon mucosal p53/p21. GH excess leads to decreased colon cell phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), increased cell survival with down-regulated APC, nuclear β-catenin accumulation, and increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition factors and colon cell motility. We propose that GH is a molecular component of the "field change" milieu permissive for neoplastic colon growth.	
25963511        	Serrated neoplasia-role in colorectal carcinogenesis and clinical implications.            	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered a heterogeneous disease, both regarding pathogenesis and clinical behaviour. Four decades ago, the adenoma-carcinoma pathway was presented as the main pathway towards CRC, a conclusion that was largely based on evidence from observational morphological studies. This concept was later substantiated at the genomic level. Over the past decade, evidence has been generated for alternative routes in which CRC might develop, in particular the serrated neoplasia pathway. Providing indisputable evidence for the neoplastic potential of serrated polyps has been difficult. Reasons include the absence of reliable longitudinal observations on individual serrated lesions that progress to cancer, a shortage of available animal models for serrated lesions and challenging culture conditions when generating organoids of serrated lesions for in vitro studies. However, a growing body of circumstantial evidence has been accumulated, which indicates that ≥15% of CRCs might arise through the serrated neoplasia pathway. An even larger amount of post-colonoscopy colorectal carcinomas (carcinomas occurring within the surveillance interval after a complete colonoscopy) have been suggested to originate from serrated polyps. The aim of this Review is to assess the current status of the serrated neoplasia pathway in CRC and highlight clinical implications.	
31958897        	Rational application of targeted therapeutics in mucinous colon/appendix cancers with positive predictive factors.            	Molecular-targeted therapies have demonstrated disappointing results against most advanced solid cancers. This may largey be attributed to irrational drug use against unselected cancers. We investigated the efficacy of dual MEK-PI3K drug therapy against KRAS mutated mucin 2 (MUC2)-secreting LS174T cells and patient-derived ex vivo and in vivo models of KRAS mutated mucinous colon/appendix cancers. These tumors demonstrate unique phenotypic and genotypic features that likely predict sensitivity to this targeted co-therapy. Co-treatment with MEK inhibitor (trametinib) and PI3K inhibitor (pictilisib)-induced synergistic cytotoxicity and intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in LS174T cells and tumor explants in vitro. Dual drug therapy also induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-associated proteins (GRP78/BiP, ATF4, and CHOP). However, CHOP knock-down assays demonstrated that mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in LS174T cells was not ERS-dependent. Dual drug therapy also significantly decreased MUC2 expression, MUC2 post-translational modification (palmitoylation) and secretion in LS174T cells, suggesting a simultaneous cytotoxic and mucin suppressive mechanism of action. We also demonstrated effective mucinous tumor growth suppression in ex vivo epithelial organoid (colonoid) cultures and in in vivo intraperitoneal patient-derived xenograft models derived from mucinous colon/appendix cancer. These promising preclinical data support a role for dual MEK-PI3K inhibitor therapy in mucinous colon/appendix cancers. We postulate that mucinous KRAS mutated cancers are especially vulnerable to this co-treatment based on their unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.                © 2020 The Authors.

32705647        	Specific Gene Expression in Lgr5+ Stem Cells by Using Cre-Lox Recombination.            	Intestinal stem cells are responsible for tissue renewal. The study of stem cell properties has become a major challenge in the field. We describe here a method based on Cre recombinase inducible lentivirus vectors that permits delivery of transgenes, either for overexpression or knockdown, in primary stem cells that can be cultured in an 3D intestinal organoid system. This method is an excellent approach for genetic manipulation and can complement in vivo transgenic experiments.	
30705106        	Omeprazole prevents CDX2 and SOX9 expression by inhibiting hedgehog signaling in Barrett's esophagus cells.            	Activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling contributes to the progression of Barrett's esophagus (BE), which increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Recent clinical studies revealed that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) but not H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) were associated with a decreased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We would like to know whether PPIs interfere with BE progression during BE treatment. Here, we explored the role of omeprazole on Hh signaling and expression of two crucial biomarkers of BE, SOX9 and CDX2. We demonstrated that bile acids elevated expression of Hh pathway target genes, such as GLI1 and PTCH1, and induced SOX9 and CDX2 up-regulation in both CP-A and CP-B cells. Omeprazole, but not famotidine, down-regulated these genes induced by bile acids. In addition, omeprazole-induced down-regulation of SOX9 and CDX2 was mediated by Hh signaling. To explore the mechanisms by which omeprazole inhibits Hh signaling, we performed luciferase assay but did not find any effects of omeprazole on the activity of GLI1 promoter, the critical transcription factor of Hh signaling. Therefore, we used miRNA sequencing and a bioinformatics tool in our study to identify the differently expressed miRNAs in BE organoids treated with or without omeprazole, and we identified miR-2116-3p was involved in omeprazole-mediated inhibition of Hh signaling and subsequent down-regulation of SOX9 and CDX2. Collectively, our data indicate omeprazole inhibits Hh signaling and subsequent SOX9 and CDX2 expression via up-regulating miR-2116-3p. We have demonstrated a novel acid-independent mechanism of omeprazole that might yield valuable insight into clinical management of BE progression, irrespective of acid reflux symptoms.                © 2019 The Author(s).

29503208        	Repurposing High-Throughput Image Assays Enables Biological Activity Prediction for Drug Discovery.            	In both academia and the pharmaceutical industry, large-scale assays for drug discovery are expensive and often impractical, particularly for the increasingly important physiologically relevant model systems that require primary cells, organoids, whole organisms, or expensive or rare reagents. We hypothesized that data from a single high-throughput imaging assay can be repurposed to predict the biological activity of compounds in other assays, even those targeting alternate pathways or biological processes. Indeed, quantitative information extracted from a three-channel microscopy-based screen for glucocorticoid receptor translocation was able to predict assay-specific biological activity in two ongoing drug discovery projects. In these projects, repurposing increased hit rates by 50- to 250-fold over that of the initial project assays while increasing the chemical structure diversity of the hits. Our results suggest that data from high-content screens are a rich source of information that can be used to predict and replace customized biological assays.

32478897        	Conditional cell reprogramming for modeling host-virus interactions and human viral diseases.            	Conventional cancer and transformed cell lines are widely used in cancer biology and other fields within biology. These cells usually have abnormalities from the original tumor itself, but may also develop abnormalities due to genetic manipulation, or genetic and epigenetic changes during long-term passages. Primary cultures may maintain lineage functions as the original tissue types, yet they have a very limited life span or population doubling time because of the nature of cellular senescence. Primary cultures usually have very low yields, and the high variability from any original tissue specimens, largely limiting their applications in research. Animal models are often used for studies of virus infections, disease modeling, development of antiviral drugs, and vaccines. Human viruses often need a series of passages in vivo to adapt to the host environment because of variable receptors on the cell surface and may have intracellular restrictions from the cell types or host species. Here, we describe a long-term cell culture system, conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs), and its applications in modeling human viral diseases and drug discovery. Using feeder layer coculture in presence of Y-27632 (conditional reprogramming, CR), CRCs can be obtained and rapidly propagated from surgical specimens, core or needle biopsies, and other minimally invasive or noninvasive specimens, for example, nasal cavity brushing. CRCs preserve their lineage functions and provide biologically relevant and physiological conditions, which are suitable for studies of viral entry and replication, innate immune responses of host cells, and discovery of antiviral drugs. In this review, we summarize the applications of CR technology in modeling host-virus interactions and human viral diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and coronavirus disease-2019, and antiviral discovery.                © 2020 The Authors.

29911112        	Translational research and application of basic biology to clinical trial development in GI cancers.            	Cancers of the gastrointestinal tract have limited available treatments and are often associated with a poor prognosis. Clinical trials and translational work associated with these trials provide the opportunity to increase understanding of the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy in these diseases. In this review we discuss the rationale for intensive translational work within the context of academic clinical trials and the successes and challenges which have been associated with translational work at our institution over the past number of years. We reflect on tissue, plasma and radiological biomarker work including a novel patient derived organoid programme and discuss the iterative application of previous results to next generation trial design.	
22043311        	A systematic screen for micro-RNAs regulating the canonical Wnt pathway.            	MicroRNAs (miRs) and the canonical Wnt pathway are known to be dysregulated in human cancers and play key roles during cancer initiation and progression. To identify miRs that can modulate the activity of the Wnt pathway we performed a cell-based overexpression screen of 470 miRs in human HEK293 cells. We identified 38 candidate miRs that either activate or repress the canonical Wnt pathway. A literature survey of all verified candidate miRs revealed that the Wnt-repressing miRs tend to be anti-oncomiRs and down-regulated in cancers while Wnt-activating miRs tend to be oncomiRs and upregulated during tumorigenesis. Epistasis-based functional validation of three candidate miRs, miR-1, miR-25 and miR-613, confirmed their inhibitory role in repressing the Wnt pathway and suggest that while miR-25 may function at the level of â-catenin (β-cat), miR-1 and miR-613 act upstream of β-cat. Both miR-25 and miR-1 inhibit cell proliferation and viability during selection of human colon cancer cell lines that exhibit dysregulated Wnt signaling. Finally, transduction of miR-1 expressing lentiviruses into primary mammary organoids derived from Conductin-lacZ mice significantly reduced the expression of the Wnt-sensitive β-gal reporter. In summary, these findings suggest the potential use of Wnt-modulating miRs as diagnostic and therapeutic tools in Wnt-dependent diseases, such as cancer.	
23316622        	Biphasic large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma--pure mucinous carcinoma of the gallbladder (MANEC): a unique combination.            	We report a case of primary combined large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)--pure mucinous carcinoma of the gallbladder (MANEC)--which represents the first description of this entity.                The patient is a 59-year-old Italian male who underwent cholecystectomy under a preoperative diagnosis of cholecystitis with gallstones and gallbladder tumour. During laparotomy, cholecystectomy, liver wedge resection and regional lymph node dissection were performed. The resected gallbladder showed a thickened wall, gallstones and a 4 cm gelatinous, cauliflower-like soft tissue mass.                Following surgery, the gallbladder tumour was diagnosed as a mixed endocrine-exocrine carcinoma. There was evidence of lymph node metastasis or direct liver invasion. The mucin-producing carcinoma was composed of poorly differentiated glandular cells with mucin lakes. The LCNEC was characterized by large cells with prominent nucleoli, coarse chromatin and a high mitotic rate. The cells showed an "organoid" growth pattern with rosette formation and frequent areas of necrosis. Chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56 were diffusely and strongly expressed.                This case may provide helpful insights regarding the histogenesis of this unusual combination of tumors: the concept of a collision tumor between two neoplasms that have arisen in adjacent areas may be the best explanation for its pathogenesis.	
31619667        	NPI-0052 and γ-radiation induce a synergistic apoptotic effect in medulloblastoma.            	Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant solid paediatric brain tumour. The standard treatment for MB is surgical resection of the tumour, radiation and chemotherapy. This therapy is associated with high morbidity and adverse side effects. Hence, more targeted and less toxic therapies are vitally needed to improve the quality of life of survivors. NPI-0052 is a novel proteasome inhibitor that irreversibly binds the 20S proteasome subunit. This compound has anti-tumour activity in metastatic solid tumours, glioblastoma and multiple myeloma with a good safety profile. Importantly, NPI-0052 has a lipophilic structure and can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, making it a suitable treatment for brain tumours. In the present study, we performed an in silico gene expression analysis to evaluate the proteasome subunit expression in MB. To evaluate the anticancer activity of NPI-0052, we used a range of MB patient-derived MB cells and cell lines. The synergistic cell death of NPI-0052 with γ-radiation was evaluated in tumour organoids derived from patient-derived MB cells. We show that high expression of proteasome subunits is a poor prognostic factor for MB patients. Also, our preclinical work demonstrated that NPI-0052 can inhibit proteasome activity and activate apoptosis in MB cells. Moreover, we observe that NPI-0052 has a synergistic apoptotic effect with γ-radiation, a component of the current MB therapy. Here, we present compelling preclinical evidence that NPI-0052 can be used as an adjuvant treatment for p53-family-expressing MB tumours.	
30888358        	Microfluidic device for expedited tumor growth towards drug evaluation.            	Patient derived organoids have emerged as robust preclinical models for screening anti-cancer therapeutics. Current 2D culturing methods do not provide physiological responses to therapeutics, therefore 3D models are being developed to better reproduce physiological responses. 3D culturing however often requires large initial cell populations and one week to one month to grow tumors ready for therapeutic testing. As a solution a 3D culturing system has been developed capable of producing physiologically relevant tumors in an expedited fashion while only requiring a small number of initial cancer cells. A bi-layer microfluidic system capable of facilitating active convective nutrient supply to populations of cancer cells facilitates expedited growth of cancer cells when starting with populations as small as 8 cells. The system has been shown to function well with adherent and non-adherent cell types by expediting cell growth by a factor ranging from 1.27 to 4.76 greater than growth under static conditions. Utilizing such an approach has enable to formation of tumors ready for therapeutic screening within 3 days and the ability to perform therapeutic screening within the microfluidic system is demonstrated. A mathematical model has been developed which allows for adjustments to be made to the dynamic delivery of nutrients in order to efficiently use culture media without excessive waste. We believe this work to be the first attempt to grow cancers in an expedited fashion utilizing only a convective nutrient supply within a microfluidic system which also facilitates on-device therapeutic screening. The developed microfluidic system and cancer growth method have the potential to offer improved drug screening for patients in clinical settings.	
30327398        	Protocol for the STRONG trial: stereotactic body radiation therapy following chemotherapy for unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, a phase I feasibility study.            	For patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), surgery is the only treatment modality that can result in cure. Unfortunately, in the majority of these patients, the tumours are found to be unresectable at presentation due to either local invasive tumour growth or the presence of distant metastases. For patients with unresectable CCA, palliative chemotherapy is the standard treatment yielding an estimated median overall survival (OS) of 12-15.2 months. There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for CCA. However, small and most often retrospective studies combining chemotherapy with SBRT have shown promising results with OS reaching up to 33-35 months.                This study has been designed as a single-centre phase I feasibility trial and will investigate the addition of SBRT after standard chemotherapy in patients with unresectable perihilar CCA (T1-4 N0-1 M0). A total of six patients will be included. SBRT will be delivered in 15 fractions of 3-4.5 Gy (risk adapted). The primary objective of this study is to determine feasibility and toxicity. Secondary outcomes include local tumour control, progression-free survival (PFS), OS and quality of life. Length of follow-up will be 2 years. As an ancillary study, the personalised effects of radiotherapy will be measured in vitro, in patient-derived tumour and bile duct organoid cultures.                Ethics approval for the STRONG trial has been granted by the Medical Ethics Committee of Erasmus MC Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It is estimated that all patients will be included between October 2017 and October 2018. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and presented at national and international conferences.

33503423        	A constant pool of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells is required for intestinal homeostasis.            	Lgr5+ crypt base columnar cells, the operational intestinal stem cells (ISCs), are thought to be dispensable for small intestinal (SI) homeostasis. Using a Lgr5-2A-DTR (diphtheria toxin receptor) model, which ablates Lgr5+ cells with near-complete efficiency and retains endogenous levels of Lgr5 expression, we show that persistent depletion of Lgr5+ ISCs in fact compromises SI epithelial integrity and reduces epithelial turnover in vivo. In vitro, Lgr5-2A-DTR SI organoids are unable to establish or survive when Lgr5+ ISCs are continuously eliminated by adding DT to the media. However, transient exposure to DT at the start of culture allows organoids to form, and the rate of outgrowth reduces with the increasing length of DT presence. Our results indicate that intestinal homeostasis requires a constant pool of Lgr5+ ISCs, which is supplied by rapidly reprogrammed non-Lgr5+ crypt populations when preexisting Lgr5+ ISCs are ablated.

32819585        	Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase regulates anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell growth and invasion into the collagen matrix.            	Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is one of the most aggressive cancer types; however, the molecular mechanism contributing to the aggressive characteristics remain unclear. Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) plays an important role in cancer invasion and has been associated with a poor prognosis in various malignant neoplasms. In this study, we investigated the relationship between MT1-MMP expression and the proliferation and invasion of ATC cells, along with the association with clinicopathologic factors in patients with ATC. Suppression of MT1-MMP reduced the proliferation and invasion of ATC cells, and suppressed ERK activity, indicating a role in cancer cell proliferation in collagen matrix culture conditions. The expression of MT1-MMP was detected in 29 of 34 (85.3%) surgical specimens from ATC patients. In addition, the expression of MT1-MMP in the tumor lesion was higher than that of normal and stromal tissues. Collectively, these results suggest that elevated MT1-MMP expression plays a role in the pathogenesis of ATC, which may promote its aggressive characteristics such as proliferation and invasion, highlighting a potential new therapeutic target.

27262173        	AIMP2 Controls Intestinal Stem Cell Compartments and Tumorigenesis by Modulating Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling.            	Wnt/β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling is crucial for the proliferation and maintenance of intestinal stem cells (ISC), but excessive activation leads to ISC expansion and eventually colorectal cancer. Thus, negative regulators are required to maintain optimal levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins (AIMP) function in protein synthesis, but have also been implicated in signaling cascades affecting angiogenesis, immunity, and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between AIMP2 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in a murine model of intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Hemizygous deletion of Aimp2 resulted in enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling, increased proliferation of cryptic epithelial cells, and expansion of ISC compartments. In an Apc(Min/+) background, Aimp2 hemizygosity increased adenoma formation. Mechanistically, AIMP2 disrupted the interaction between AXIN and Dishevelled-1 (DVL1) to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling by competing with AXIN. Furthermore, AIMP2 inhibited intestinal organoid formation and growth by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling in an Aimp2 gene dosage-dependent manner. Collectively, our results showed that AIMP2 acts as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that fine-tunes Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the intestine, illuminating the regulation of ISC abundance and activity.

27453906        	Longitudinal Bioluminescent Quantification of Three Dimensional Cell Growth.            	The use of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems is widely accepted as representing a more physiologically relevant means to propagate mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells. However, 3D cultures systems are plagued by several experimental and technical limitations as compared to their traditional 2D counterparts. For instance, quantifying the growth of mammary epithelial or breast cancer organoids longitudinally is particularly troublesome using standard [3H]thymidine or MTT assay systems, or using computer-assisted area calculations. Likewise, the nature of the multicellular aggregates and organoids formed by breast cancer cells under 3D conditions precludes efficient recovery of the cells from 3D matrices, an event that is time consuming and leads to spurious results. The assay described here utilizes stable expression of firefly luciferase as means to quantify the longitudinal outgrowth of cells propagated within a 3D matrices. The major advantages of this technique include its high-throughput nature and ability to longitudinally track single wells over a defined period of time, thereby decreasing the costs associated with assay performance. Finally, this technique can be readily combined with drug treatments and/or genetic manipulations to assay their effects on the growth of 3D organoids.

27448962        	Gastrin stimulates a cholecystokinin-2-receptor-expressing cardia progenitor cell and promotes progression of Barrett's-like esophagus.            	The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing, but factors contributing to malignant progression of its precursor lesion, Barrett's esophagus (BE), have not been defined. Hypergastrinemia caused by long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has been suggested as one possible risk factor. The gastrin receptor, CCK2R, is expressed in the cardia and upregulated in BE, suggesting the involvement of the gastrin-CCK2R pathway in progression. In the L2-IL-1β mouse model, Barrett's-like esophagus arises from the gastric cardia. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the effect of hypergastrinemia on CCK2R+ progenitor cells in L2-IL-1β mice.                L2-IL-1β mice were mated with hypergastrinemic (INS-GAS) mice or treated with PPIs to examine the effect of hypergastrinemia in BE progression. CCK2R-CreERT crossed with L2-IL-1β mice were used to analyze the lineage progenitor potential of CCK2R+ cells. Cardia glands were cultured in vitro, and the effect of gastrin treatment analyzed. L2-IL-1β mice were treated with a CCK2R antagonist YF476 as a potential chemopreventive drug.                Hypergastrinemia resulted in increased proliferation and expansion of Barrett's-like esophagus. Lineage tracing experiments revealed that CCK2R+ cells are long-lived progenitors that can give rise to such lesions under chronic inflammation. Gastrin stimulated organoid growth in cardia culture, while CCK2R inhibition prevented Barrett's-like esophagus and dysplasia.                Our data suggest a progression model for BE to EAC in which CCK2R+ progenitor cells, stimulated by hypergastrinemia, proliferate to give rise to metaplasia and dysplasia. Hypergastrinemia can result from PPI use, and the effects of hypergastrinemia in human BE should be studied further.	
30142714        	Giant fibrous hamartoma of infancy: pitfall of CD34 positive dermal mesenchymal tumor.            	Fibrous hamartoma of infancy (FHI) is a rare benign soft tissue tumor with a triphasic organoid histologic appearance. The authors present a case of a 21-month-old healthy girl with a slowly growing flesh-colored subcutaneous plaque 12cm in size on the lower back, with overlying hypertrichosis. A punch biopsy revealed a proliferation of spindle cells infiltrating the dermis and hypodermis organized in a dense storiform pattern with a strong diffuse positivity for CD34. The diagnosis of congenital dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) was considered and an excision was performed. Histopathologic analysis showed an extensive poorly demarcated mass infiltrating the dermis and hypodermis, composed of different components: a monomorphous fibroblastic/myofibroblastic component, a mature adipose component, and an immature mesenchymal basophilic component. The clinical aspects with the histologic and immunohistochemical features led to the diagnosis of giant fibrous hamartoma of infancy. In our case the strong diffuse CD34 positivity was a diagnostic pitfall leading to an incorrect hypothesis of congenital DFSP. The characteristic triphasic histology of FHI was missed owing to the small size of the punch biopsy. This article highlights the importance of being aware of the CD34+ dermal mesenchymal tumor differential diagnosis and the necessity of appropriate size biopsies to avoid sampling error.	
29275953        	Translational research to enable personalized treatment of cystic fibrosis.            	Translational research efforts in cystic fibrosis (CF) aim to develop therapies for all subjects with CF. To reach this goal new therapies need to be developed that target multiple aspects of the disease. To enable individuals to benefit maximally from these treatments will require improved methods to tailor these therapies specifically to individuals who suffer from CF. This report highlights current examples of translational CF research efforts to reach this goal. The use of intestinal organoids and genetics to better understand individual assessment of CFTR modulator treatment effects to ultimately enable a better personalized treatment for CF subjects will be discussed. In addition, development of viral vectors and non-viral synthetic nanoparticles for delivery of mRNA, sgRNA and DNA will be highlighted. New approaches to restore function of CFTR with early premature termination codons using nanoparticle delivery of suppressor tRNAs and new insights into mechanisms of airway epithelial repair will be reviewed as well. The state-of-the-art approaches that are discussed in this review demonstrate significant progress towards the development of optimal individual therapies for CF patients, but also reveal that remaining challenges still lie ahead.

32074725        	[Alveolar soft part sarcoma in children: a clinicopathological study of 13 cases].            	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological manifestations, molecular genetic, diagnostic histology and differential diagnosis of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) in children. Methods: A total of 13 cases of ASPS diagnosed at Beijing Children's Hospital from August 2009 to November 2018 were collected. HE staining, histochemical staining for PAS and D-PAS, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for TFE3, INI1 and CD68 and florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for TFE3 gene translocation were performed. Results: There were four males and nine females, age ranged from 1 year and 2 months to 13 years and 8 months (mean 7.8 years); and four patients were under 5 years old. Histologically, the tumors showed a distinctive and characteristic nested or organoid growth pattern (11 cases) or solid, diffuse growth (2 cases). The tumor cells possessed abundant eosinophilic, or glycogen-rich and clear to vacuolated cytoplasm. The chromatin was relatively dispersed, with prominent and pleomorphic nucleoli; mitotic figures were rare. Vascular invasion was frequently seen. IHC staining showed specific nuclear TFE3 staining. The tumor cells were also positive for INI1,CD68 and vimentin; but were negative for MyoD1, Myogenin, CK and S-100 protein. Seven cases showed PAS and D-PAS staining, with fuchsia acicular or rod-shaped crystals in tumor cytoplasm. Nine cases showed TFE3 break-apart signals by FISH. Conclusions: ASPS is a rare soft tissue sarcoma in children. Compared with ASPA in adults, it has both similarities and unique clinicopathologic characteristics. The diagnosis needs to be confirmed by combining clinical, pathologic, IHC and genetic testing.	
26439620        	Neuroendocrine tumor G3: a pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with a high proliferative rate.            	A 68-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of left upper quadrant pain. Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed a low density mass with delayed contrast effects as well as para-aortic node swelling with homogenous contrast effects. Histological examination of specimens obtained by endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration revealed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) G2, according to the World Health Organization 2010 classification, and lymph node metastasis. Distal pancreatectomy and lymph node dissection were performed. On histological examination, the tumor showed well-differentiated morphology with an organoid pattern. The Ki67 labeling index was 21.6 %, and the mitotic count was 25/10 high power fields. As mentioned above, we made a final diagnosis of the lesion as "NET G3," because the tumor presented with well-differentiated morphology. Chemotherapy with Everolimus was administered. Liver metastasis occurred 11 months after the first operation, and a partial hepatectomy was performed. Histological findings were similar to those of the first operation. Herein we present a case of pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with a high proliferative rate referred to as "NET G3," and review the relevant literature.	
29949757        	Mutant p53-Expressing Cells Undergo Necroptosis via Cell Competition with the Neighboring Normal Epithelial Cells.            	p53 is a tumor suppressor protein, and its missense mutations are frequently found in human cancers. During the multi-step progression of cancer, p53 mutations generally accumulate at the mid or late stage, but not in the early stage, and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, using mammalian cell culture and mouse ex vivo systems, we demonstrate that when p53R273H- or p53R175H-expressing cells are surrounded by normal epithelial cells, mutant p53 cells undergo necroptosis and are basally extruded from the epithelial monolayer. When mutant p53 cells alone are present, cell death does not occur, indicating that necroptosis results from cell competition with the surrounding normal cells. Furthermore, when p53R273H mutation occurs within RasV12-transformed epithelia, cell death is strongly suppressed and most of the p53R273H-expressing cells remain intact. These results suggest that the order of oncogenic mutations in cancer development could be dictated by cell competition.                Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

29593534        	East Indian Sandalwood Oil Is a Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor: A New Therapeutic Option in the Treatment of Inflammatory Skin Disease.            	Cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production. One isoform, PDE4, is overactive in chronic relapsing inflammatory skin diseases: psoriasis and eczema/atopic dermatitis, and in several cancers. East Indian sandalwood oil (EISO) has significant anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we report that 75% of pediatric eczema/atopic dermatitis patients treated with topical EISO formulations achieved a >50% reduction in their Eczema Area and Severity Index score. EISO treatment of a psoriasis model reduced PDE4 expression and reversed histopathology. EISO directly inhibited PDE enzymatic activity in vitro. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human dermal fibroblast, BEAS-2B, A549, and THP-1 cells, EISO suppressed total cellular PDE activity, PDE4, and 7 transcript levels, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine production. These results suggest that EISO anti-inflammatory activity is mediated through suppressing PDE activity, thus facilitating cAMP-regulated inhibition of NF-κB and indicate EISO as an attractive natural therapeutic for chronic and acute inflammatory disorders.	
28094771        	Orphan Gpr182 suppresses ERK-mediated intestinal proliferation during regeneration and adenoma formation.            	Orphan GPCRs provide an opportunity to identify potential pharmacological targets, yet their expression patterns and physiological functions remain challenging to elucidate. Here, we have used a genetically engineered knockin reporter mouse to map the expression pattern of the Gpr182 during development and adulthood. We observed that Gpr182 is expressed at the crypt base throughout the small intestine, where it is enriched in crypt base columnar stem cells, one of the most active stem cell populations in the body. Gpr182 knockdown had no effect on homeostatic intestinal proliferation in vivo, but led to marked increases in proliferation during intestinal regeneration following irradiation-induced injury. In the ApcMin mouse model, which forms spontaneous intestinal adenomas, reductions in Gpr182 led to more adenomas and decreased survival. Loss of Gpr182 enhanced organoid growth efficiency ex vivo in an EGF-dependent manner. Gpr182 reduction led to increased activation of ERK1/2 in basal and challenge models, demonstrating a potential role for this orphan GPCR in regulating the proliferative capacity of the intestine. Importantly, GPR182 expression was profoundly reduced in numerous human carcinomas, including colon adenocarcinoma. Together, these results implicate Gpr182 as a negative regulator of intestinal MAPK signaling-induced proliferation, particularly during regeneration and adenoma formation.	
32421010        	Electrochemotherapy in 3D Ocular Melanoma Spheroids using a Customized Electrode.            	Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is the combination of transient pore formation following electric pulse application with the administration of cytotoxic drugs, which enhances the cytotoxic effect of the applied agent due to membrane changes. In vitro 3D culture systems simulate the in vivo tumor growth and preserve the biological characteristics of tumors more accurately than conventional monolayer cell cultures. We describe a protocol for the development of 3D tumor organoids using conjunctival melanoma (CM) and uveal melanoma (UM) cell lines as well as the use of hand-held customized electrodes, suitable for in vitro ECT in the culture well without destruction of the tumor environment. This protocol analyzes the culture and growth of 3D CM and UM spheroids and their reaction to bleomycin (2.5 µg/mL) alone, electroporation (EP) (750 Volts/cm, 8 pulses, 100 µs, 5 Hz) alone, and ECT as a combination of EP and bleomycin. The drug concentration and the EP settings used in this protocol were established as preferred ECT conditions according to previous experiments. The assay used to determine the spheroid viability was conducted 3-7 days following treatment. The effect on viability and growth of the 3D tumor spheroids was significant only after ECT. The customized electrodes are described in detail in order to facilitate the application of pulses in the culture well. This novel treatment of 3D UM and CM spheroids sets a steppingstone for future clinical application.	
28326191        	Global histone modification fingerprinting in human cells using epigenetic reverse phase protein array.            	The balance between acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins plays a critical role in the regulation of genomic functions. Aberrations in global levels of histone modifications are linked to carcinogenesis and are currently the focus of intense scrutiny and translational research investments to develop new therapies, which can modify complex disease pathophysiology through epigenetic control. However, despite significant progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic machinery in various genomic contexts and cell types, the links between epigenetic modifications and cellular phenotypes are far from being clear. For example, enzymes controlling histone modifications utilize key cellular metabolites associated with intra- and extracellular feedback loops, adding a further layer of complexity to this process. Meanwhile, it has become increasingly evident that new assay technologies which provide robust and precise measurement of global histone modifications are required, for at least two pressing reasons: firstly, many approved drugs are known to influence histone modifications and new cancer therapies are increasingly being developed towards targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other epigenetic readers and writers. Therefore, robust assays for fingerprinting the global effects of such drugs on preclinical cell, organoid and in vivo models is required; and secondly, robust histone-fingerprinting assays applicable to patient samples may afford the development of next-generation diagnostic and prognostic tools. In our study, we have used a panel of monoclonal antibodies to determine the relative changes in the global abundance of post-translational modifications on histones purified from cancer cell lines treated with HDAC inhibitors using a novel technique, called epigenetic reverse phase protein array. We observed a robust increase in acetylation levels within 2-24 h after inhibition of HDACs in different cancer cell lines. Moreover, when these cells were treated with N-acetylated amino acids in addition to HDACs, we detected a further increase in histone acetylation, demonstrating that these molecules could be utilized as donors of the acetyl moiety for protein acetylation. Consequently, this study not only offers a novel assay for diagnostics and drug screening but also warrants further research of the novel class of inexpensive, non-toxic natural compounds that could potentiate the effects of HDAC inhibitors and is therefore of interest for cancer therapeutics.	
29421553        	Hacking macrophage-associated immunosuppression for regulating glioblastoma angiogenesis.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary adult brain tumor and its pathology is hallmarked by distorted neovascularization, diffuse tumor-associated macrophage infiltration, and potent immunosuppression. Reconstituting organotypic tumor angiogenesis models with biomimetic cell heterogeneity and interactions, pro-/anti-inflammatory milieu and extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics is critical for preclinical anti-angiogenic therapeutic screening. However, current in vitro systems do not accurately mirror in vivo human brain tumor microenvironment. Here, we engineered a three-dimensional (3D), microfluidic angiogenesis model with controllable and biomimetic immunosuppressive conditions, immune-vascular and cell-matrix interactions. We demonstrate in vitro, GL261 and CT-2A GBM-like tumors steer macrophage polarization towards a M2-like phenotype for fostering an immunosuppressive and proangiogenic niche, which is consistent with human brain tumors. We distinguished that GBM and M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages promote angiogenesis, while M1-like pro-inflammatory macrophages suppress angiogenesis, which we coin "inflammation-driven angiogenesis." We observed soluble immunosuppressive cytokines, predominantly TGF-β1, and surface integrin (αvβ3) endothelial-macrophage interactions are required in inflammation-driven angiogenesis. We demonstrated tuning cell-adhesion receptors using an integrin (αvβ3)-specific collagen hydrogel regulated inflammation-driven angiogenesis through Src-PI3K-YAP signaling, highlighting the importance of altered cell-ECM interactions in inflammation. To validate the preclinical applications of our 3D organoid model and mechanistic findings of inflammation-driven angiogenesis, we screened a novel dual integrin (αvβ3) and cytokine receptor (TGFβ-R1) blockade that suppresses GBM tumor neovascularization by simultaneously targeting macrophage-associated immunosuppression, endothelial-macrophage interactions, and altered ECM. Hence, we provide an interactive and controllable GBM tumor microenvironment and highlight the importance of macrophage-associated immunosuppression in GBM angiogenesis, paving a new direction of screening novel anti-angiogenic therapies.

30779922        	MicroRNA-31 Reduces Inflammatory Signaling and Promotes Regeneration in Colon Epithelium, and Delivery of Mimics in Microspheres Reduces Colitis in Mice.            	Levels of microRNA 31 (MIR31) are increased in intestinal tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and colitis-associated neoplasias. We investigated the effects of this microRNA on intestinal inflammation by studying mice with colitis.                We obtained colon biopsy samples from 82 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 79 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 34 healthy individuals (controls) at Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital. MIR31- knockout mice and mice with conditional disruption of Mir31 specifically in the intestinal epithelium (MIR31 conditional knockouts) were given dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to induce colitis. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays to study proteins that regulate expression of MIR31, including STAT3 and p65, in LOVO colorectal cancer cells and organoids derived from mouse colon cells. Partially hydrolyzed alpha-lactalbumin was used to generate peptosome nanoparticles, and MIR31 mimics were loaded onto their surface using electrostatic adsorption. Peptosome-MIR31 mimic particles were encapsulated into oxidized konjac glucomannan (OKGM) microspheres, which were administered by enema into the large intestines of mice with DSS-induced colitis. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry.                Levels of MIR31 were increased in inflamed mucosa from patients with CD or UC, and from mice with colitis, compared with controls. STAT3 and nuclear factor-κB activated transcription of MIR31 in colorectal cancer cells and organoids in response to tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)6. MIR31-knockout and conditional-knockout mice developed more severe colitis in response to DSS and TNBS, with increased immune responses, compared with control mice. MIR31 bound to 3' untranslated regions of Il17ra and Il7r messenger RNAs (RNAs) (which encode receptors for the inflammatory cytokines IL17 and IL7) and Il6st mRNA (which encodes GP130, a cytokine signaling protein). These mRNAs and proteins were greater in MIR31-knockout mice with colitis, compared with control mice; MIR31 and MIR31 mimics inhibited their expression. MIR31 also promoted epithelial regeneration by regulating the WNT and Hippo signaling pathways. OKGM peptosome-MIR31 mimic microspheres localized to colonic epithelial cells in mice with colitis; they reduced the inflammatory response, increased body weight and colon length, and promoted epithelial cell proliferation.                MIR31, increased in colon tissues from patients with CD or UC, reduces the inflammatory response in colon epithelium of mice by preventing expression of inflammatory cytokine receptors (Il7R and Il17RA) and signaling proteins (GP130). MIR31 also regulates the WNT and Hippo signaling pathways to promote epithelial regeneration following injury. OKGM peptosome-MIR31 microspheres localize to the colon epithelium of mice to reduce features of colitis. Transcript Profiling: GSE123556.                Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

29437785        	Dia1-dependent adhesions are required by epithelial tissues to initiate invasion.            	Developing tissues change shape and tumors initiate spreading through collective cell motility. Conserved mechanisms by which tissues initiate motility into their surroundings are not known. We investigated cytoskeletal regulators during collective invasion by mouse tumor organoids and epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) acini undergoing branching morphogenesis in collagen. Use of the broad-spectrum formin inhibitor SMIFH2 prevented the formation of migrating cell fronts in both cell types. Focusing on the role of the formin Dia1 in branching morphogenesis, we found that its depletion in MDCK cells does not alter planar cell motility either within the acinus or in two-dimensional scattering assays. However, Dia1 was required to stabilize protrusions extending into the collagen matrix. Live imaging of actin, myosin, and collagen in control acini revealed adhesions that deformed individual collagen fibrils and generated large traction forces, whereas Dia1-depleted acini exhibited unstable adhesions with minimal collagen deformation and lower force generation. This work identifies Dia1 as an essential regulator of tissue shape changes through its role in stabilizing focal adhesions.                © 2018 Fessenden et al.	
33223851        	Dedifferentiated Endometrioid Carcinomas with Neuroendocrine Differentiation: A Clinicopathological and Immunohistochemical Study of Three Cases.            	To investigate the relationship between dedifferentiated endometrioid carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation and mismatch repair deficiency.                The clinicopathological records and samples of three patients were retrieved from the Pathology Department of Zhejiang University's School of Medicine Women's Hospital.                The tumors comprised one dominant poorly differentiated component (60-90% of the neoplasm volume) and one well-differentiated glandular component. The poorly differentiated component showed solid sheets with organoid growth patterns and insular, trabecular and rosette/pseudorosette patterns. Large polygonal cells, vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm were observed in the poorly differentiated area. All three cases were diffusely positive for p16 and for at least two of three neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin, synaptophysin, neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56)) in >10% of cancer cells. Loss of MMR protein expression was found in two patients: MLH1 and PSM2 in patient 2 and MSH2 and MSH 6 in patient 3. Abnormal P53 and SMARCB1 (INI1) expression was noted in patient 3. All three patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and two received postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The patients survived disease-free for 60, 26 and 15 months, respectively.                Dedifferentiated endometrioid carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation may be associated with mismatch repair deficiency and have an improved prognosis.                © 2020 Zhou et al.	
32211418        	Is It Time to Start Transitioning From 2D to 3D Cell Culture?            	Cell culture is an important and necessary process in drug discovery, cancer research, as well as stem cell study. Most cells are currently cultured using two-dimensional (2D) methods but new and improved methods that implement three-dimensional (3D) cell culturing techniques suggest compelling evidence that much more advanced experiments can be performed yielding valuable insights. When performing 3D cell culture experiments, the cell environment can be manipulated to mimic that of a cell in vivo and provide more accurate data about cell-to-cell interactions, tumor characteristics, drug discovery, metabolic profiling, stem cell research, and other types of diseases. Scaffold based techniques such as hydrogel-based support, polymeric hard material-based support, hydrophilic glass fiber, and organoids are employed, and each provide their own advantages and applications. Likewise, there are also scaffold free techniques used such as hanging drop microplates, magnetic levitation, and spheroid microplates with ultra-low attachment coating. 3D cell culture has the potential to provide alternative ways to study organ behavior via the use of organoids and is expected to eventually bridge the gap between 2D cell culture and animal models. The present review compares 2D cell culture to 3D cell culture, provides the details surrounding the different 3D culture techniques, as well as focuses on the present and future applications of 3D cell culture.

28637362        	Spindle Cell Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma of the Palatine Tonsil With CRTC1-MAML2 Fusion Transcript: Report of a Rare Case in a 17-Year-Old Boy and a Review of the Literature.            	Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) with a predominant spindle cell composition occurring in the palatine tonsil is exceedingly rare. We present a case of a 17-year-old boy with an uncommon spindle cell variant of MEC arising in the palatine tonsil. Histologically, the tumor showed a solid, noncystic architecture and was composed of a predominant population of bland spindle to fusiform cells arranged in organoid nests with interspersed goblet cells and focal areas of ductular structures. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed the presence of a t(11;19) CRTC1-MAML2 gene fusion in this rare variant of MEC. This is the first case report of a spindle cell MEC of the palatine tonsil, with molecular genetic confirmation. It illustrates the importance of awareness and recognition of this uncommon histological variant of MEC, which will help establish appropriate treatment and prognostication.	
31649238        	Fate-mapping post-hypoxic tumor cells reveals a ROS-resistant phenotype that promotes metastasis.            	Hypoxia is known to be detrimental in cancer and contributes to its development. In this work, we present an approach to fate-map hypoxic cells in vivo in order to determine their cellular response to physiological O2 gradients as well as to quantify their contribution to metastatic spread. We demonstrate the ability of the system to fate-map hypoxic cells in 2D, and in 3D spheroids and organoids. We identify distinct gene expression patterns in cells that experienced intratumoral hypoxia in vivo compared to cells exposed to hypoxia in vitro. The intratumoral hypoxia gene-signature is a better prognostic indicator for distant metastasis-free survival. Post-hypoxic tumor cells have an ROS-resistant phenotype that provides a survival advantage in the bloodstream and promotes their ability to establish overt metastasis. Post-hypoxic cells retain an increase in the expression of a subset of hypoxia-inducible genes at the metastatic site, suggesting the possibility of a 'hypoxic memory.'	
29040564        	N-cadherin identifies human endometrial epithelial progenitor cells by in vitro stem cell assays.            	Is there a specific surface marker that identifies human endometrial epithelial progenitor cells with adult stem cell activity using in vitro assays?                N-cadherin isolates clonogenic, self-renewing human endometrial epithelial progenitor cells with high proliferative potential that differentiate into cytokeratin+ gland-like structures in vitro and identifies their location in some cells of gland profiles predominantly in basalis endometrium adjacent to the myometrium.                Human endometrium contains a small population of clonogenic, self-renewing epithelial cells with high proliferative potential that differentiate into large gland-like structures, but their identity and location is unknown. Stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) distinguishes the epithelium of basalis from functionalis and is a marker of human post-menopausal (Post-M) endometrial epithelium.                Prospective observational study of endometrial epithelial cells obtained from hysterectomy samples taken from 50 pre-menopausal (Pre-M) and 24 Post-M women, of which 4 were from women who had taken daily estradiol valerate 2 mg/day for 8 weeks prior.                Gene profiling was used to identify differentially expressed surface markers between fresh EpCAM (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)-magnetic bead-selected basalis-like epithelial cells from Post-M endometrium compared with predominantly functionalis epithelial cells from Pre-M endometrium and validated by qRT-PCR. In vitro clonogenicity and self-renewal assays were used to assess the stem/progenitor cell properties of magnetic bead-sorted N-cadherin+ and N-cadherin- epithelial cells. The cellular identity, location and phenotype of N-cadherin+ cells was assessed by dual colour immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy for cytokeratin, proliferative status (Ki-67), ERα, SSEA-1, SOX9 and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers on full thickness human endometrium.                CDH2 (N-cadherin gene) was one of 11 surface molecules highly expressed in Post-M compared to Pre-M endometrial epithelial cells. N-cadherin+ cells comprise a median 16.7% (n = 8) and 20.2% (n = 5) of Pre-M endometrial epithelial cells by flow cytometry and magnetic bead sorting, respectively. N-cadherin+ epithelial cells from Pre-M endometrium were more clonogenic than N-cadherin- cells (n = 12, P = 0.003), underwent more population doublings (n = 7), showed greater capacity for serial cloning (n = 7) and differentiated into cytokeratin+ gland-like organoids. N-cadherin immunolocalised to the lateral and apical membrane of epithelial cells in the bases of glands in the basalis of Pre-M endometrium and Post-M gland profiles, co-expressing cytokeratin, ERα but not SSEA-1 or SOX9, which localized on gland profiles proximal to N-cadherin+ cells. N-cadherin+ cells were quiescent (Ki-67-) in the basalis and in Post-M endometrial glands and co-localized with EMT markers vimentin and E-cadherin.                The raw and processed data files from the gene microarray have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus data set with accession number GSE35221.                This is a descriptive study in human endometrium only using in vitro stem cell assays. The differential ability of N-cadherin+ and N-cadherin-cells to generate endometrial glands in vivo was not determined. A small number of uterine tissues analysed contained adenomyosis for which N-cadherin has been implicated in epithelial-EMT.                A new marker enriching for human endometrial epithelial progenitor cells identifies a different and potentially more primitive cell population than SSEA-1, suggesting a potential hierarchy of epithelial differentiation in the basalis. Using N-cadherin as a marker, the molecular and cellular characteristics of epithelial progenitor cells and their role in endometrial proliferative disorders including endometriosis, adenomyosis and thin dysfunctional endometrium can be investigated.

31881079        	IPO11 mediates βcatenin nuclear import in a subset of colorectal cancers.            	Activation of Wnt signaling entails βcatenin protein stabilization and translocation to the nucleus to regulate context-specific transcriptional programs. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) initiate following APC mutations, resulting in Wnt ligand-independent stabilization and nuclear accumulation of βcatenin. The mechanisms underlying βcatenin nucleocytoplasmic shuttling remain incompletely defined. Using a novel, positive selection, functional genomic strategy, DEADPOOL, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen and identified IPO11 as a required factor for βcatenin-mediated transcription in APC mutant CRC cells. IPO11 (Importin-11) is a nuclear import protein that shuttles cargo from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. IPO11-/- cells exhibit reduced nuclear βcatenin protein levels and decreased βcatenin target gene activation, suggesting IPO11 facilitates βcatenin nuclear import. IPO11 knockout decreased colony formation of CRC cell lines and decreased proliferation of patient-derived CRC organoids. Our findings uncover a novel nuclear import mechanism for βcatenin in cells with high Wnt activity.                © 2019 Mis et al.	
32692912        	Fluorescent multiplexing of 3D spheroids: Analysis of biomarkers using automated immunohistochemistry staining platform and multispectral imaging.            	In preclinical cancer studies, three-dimensional (3D) cell spheroids and aggregates are preferred over monolayer cell cultures due to their architectural and functional similarity to solid tumors. We performed a proof-of-concept study to generate physiologically relevant and predictive preclinical models using non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma, and colon and colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line-derived 3D spheroids and aggregates. Distinct panels were designed to determine the expression profiles of frequently studied biomarkers of the two cancer subtypes. The lung adenocarcinoma panel included ALK, EGFR, TTF-1, and CK7 biomarkers, and the colon and colorectal adenocarcinoma panel included BRAF V600E, MSH2, MSH6, and CK20. Recent advances in immunofluorescence (IF) multiplexing and imaging technology enable simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple biomarkers on a single slide. In this study, we performed IF staining of multiple biomarkers per section on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 3D spheroids and aggregates. We optimized protocol parameters for automated IF and demonstrated staining concordance with automated chromogenic immunohistochemistry performed with validated protocols. Next, post-acquisition spectral unmixing of the captured fluorescent signals were utilized to delineate four differently stained biomarkers within a single multiplex IF image, followed by automated quantification of the expressed markers. This workflow has the potential to be adapted to preclinical high-throughput screening and drug efficacy studies utilizing 3D spheroids from cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids. The process allows for cost, time, and resource savings through concurrent staining of several biomarkers on a single slide, the ability to study the interactions of multiple expressed proteins within a single region of interest, and enable quantitative assessment of biomarkers in cancer cells.                © 2020 The Authors.

30878664        	A Novel Gastric Spheroid Co-culture Model Reveals Chemokine-Dependent Recruitment of Human Dendritic Cells to the Gastric Epithelium.            	Gastric dendritic cells (DCs) control the adaptive response to infection with Helicobacter pylori, a major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. We hypothesize that DC interactions with the gastric epithelium position gastric DCs for uptake of luminal H pylori and promote DC responses to epithelial-derived mediators. The aim of this study was to determine whether the gastric epithelium actively recruits DCs using a novel co-culture model of human gastric epithelial spheroids and monocyte-derived DCs.                Spheroid cultures of primary gastric epithelial cells were infected with H pylori by microinjection. Co-cultures were established by adding human monocyte-derived DCs to the spheroid cultures and were analyzed for DC recruitment and antigen uptake by confocal microscopy. Protein array, gene expression polymerase chain reaction array, and chemotaxis assays were used to identify epithelial-derived chemotactic factors that attract DCs. Data from the co-culture model were confirmed using human gastric tissue samples.                Human monocyte-derived DCs co-cultured with gastric spheroids spontaneously migrated to the gastric epithelium, established tight interactions with the epithelial cells, and phagocytosed luminally applied H pylori. DC recruitment was increased upon H pylori infection of the spheroids and involved the activity of multiple chemokines including CXCL1, CXCL16, CXCL17, and CCL20. Enhanced chemokine expression and DC recruitment to the gastric epithelium also was observed in H pylori-infected human gastric tissue samples.                Our results indicate that the gastric epithelium actively recruits DCs for immunosurveillance and pathogen sampling through chemokine-dependent mechanisms, with increased recruitment upon active H pylori infection.

32553168        	Low-Dose Vertical Inhibition of the RAF-MEK-ERK Cascade Causes Apoptotic Death of KRAS Mutant Cancers.            	We address whether combinations with a pan-RAF inhibitor (RAFi) would be effective in KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Chemical library and CRISPR genetic screens identify combinations causing apoptotic anti-tumor activity. The most potent combination, concurrent inhibition of RAF (RAFi) and ERK (ERKi), is highly synergistic at low doses in cell line, organoid, and rat models of PDAC, whereas each inhibitor alone is only cytostatic. Comprehensive mechanistic signaling studies using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) pathway mapping and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) show that RAFi/ERKi induced insensitivity to loss of negative feedback and system failures including loss of ERK signaling, FOSL1, and MYC; shutdown of the MYC transcriptome; and induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. We conclude that low-dose vertical inhibition of the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade is an effective therapeutic strategy for KRAS mutant PDAC.                Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

32859606        	Pleiotropic Mechanisms Drive Endocrine Resistance in the Three-Dimensional Bone Microenvironment.            	Although hormonal therapy (HT) inhibits the growth of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast and prostate cancers, HT resistance frequently develops within the complex metastatic microenvironment of the host organ (often the bone), a setting poorly recapitulated in 2D culture systems. To address this limitation, we cultured HR+ breast cancer and prostate cancer spheroids and patient-derived organoids in 3D extracellular matrices (ECM) alone or together with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). In 3D monocultures, antiestrogens and antiandrogens induced anoikis by abrogating anchorage-independent growth of HR+ cancer cells but exhibited only modest effects against tumor cells residing in the ECM niche. In contrast, BMSC induced hormone-independent growth of breast cancer and prostate cancer spheroids and restored lumen filling in the presence of HR-targeting agents. Molecular and functional characterization of BMSC-induced hormone independence and HT resistance in anchorage-independent cells revealed distinct context-dependent mechanisms. Cocultures of ZR75-1 and LNCaP with BMSCs exhibited paracrine IL6-induced HT resistance via attenuation of HR protein expression, which was reversed by inhibition of IL6 or JAK signaling. Paracrine IL6/JAK/STAT3-mediated HT resistance was confirmed in patient-derived organoids cocultured with BMSCs. Distinctly, MCF7 and T47D spheroids retained ER protein expression in cocultures but acquired redundant compensatory signals enabling anchorage independence via ERK and PI3K bypass cascades activated in a non-IL6-dependent manner. Collectively, these data characterize the pleiotropic hormone-independent mechanisms underlying acquisition and restoration of anchorage-independent growth in HR+ tumors. Combined analysis of tumor and microenvironmental biomarkers in metastatic biopsies of HT-resistant patients can help refine treatment approaches. SIGNIFICANCE: This study uncovers a previously underappreciated dependency of tumor cells on HR signaling for anchorage-independent growth and highlights how the metastatic microenvironment restores this malignant property of cancer cells during hormone therapy.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

27879513        	High-grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Lung With Carcinoid Morphology: A Study of 12 Cases.            	Twelve lung neuroendocrine tumors with morphologic features of carcinoid tumors but with mitotic count >10/2 mm are reported. There were 7 males and 5 females, with age ranging from 56 to 78 years. Four cases were from never-smokers. All tumors showed architectural and cytomorphologic features of carcinoid tumor, including organoid nesting, insular, trabecular, or acinar growth, and tumor cells with low nucleocytoplasmic ratio, abundant cytoplasm, ovoid to round nuclei, and salt and pepper chromatin. Angulated or confluent nesting, insular or lobular growth pattern was also seen. Nuclear irregularities and anisonucleosis were focally present. Mitotic count ranged from 11 to 61/2 mm. Punctate-type necrosis was present in 8 tumors. Anaplastic cytology, large infarct-type necrosis, desmoplasia, or marked inflammatory infiltrate was not found in any of the tumors. One tumor occurred in the background of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine hyperplasia. All tumors were treated by resection, and all but 1 patient subsequently developed metastasis, and 7 died of the tumor. For metastatic tumors, 4 patients were treated by platinum-based chemotherapy with no apparent response, whereas 3 other patients were treated by combined capecitabine and temozolomide-novel chemotherapy for well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor/carcinoid tumor-2 of them responded. This subset of tumor would be classified as large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma according to the current WHO classification scheme, but their clinical and pathologic features appear to have more in common with the carcinoid tumor group than large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, therefore, identification of this subset may be relevant for further therapeutic management.	
27147463        	The third dimension: new developments in cell culture models for colorectal research.            	Cellular models are important tools in various research areas related to colorectal biology and associated diseases. Herein, we review the most widely used cell lines and the different techniques to grow them, either as cell monolayer, polarized two-dimensional epithelia on membrane filters, or as three-dimensional spheres in scaffold-free or matrix-supported culture conditions. Moreover, recent developments, such as gut-on-chip devices or the ex vivo growth of biopsy-derived organoids, are also discussed. We provide an overview on the potential applications but also on the limitations for each of these techniques, while evaluating their contribution to provide more reliable cellular models for research, diagnostic testing, or pharmacological validation related to colon physiology and pathophysiology.	
28867347        	Functional Enterospheres Derived In Vitro from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.            	Intestinal organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are valuable in vitro research models that enable simplified access to human gastrointestinal tissues. Here, we report the in vitro generation of enterospheres (hEnS) from hPSC-derived gastrointestinal epithelial precursors. hEnS are cystic spheroids with a simple uniform structure composed entirely of intestinal epithelium. hEnS express markers of mature brush border cells and share a transcriptome profile similar to that of more mature intestinal organoids. Modulation of signaling cues enables control of hEnS growth and differentiation, including long-term propagation. We show that hEnS can be exploited for functional studies: hEnS display an innate immune response when treated with enteric pathogens, and transgenic modification of hEnS with a fluorescence cell-cycle reporter enables hEnS-forming stem cell enrichment. Our work establishes hEnS as an accessible and tractable in vitro modeling system for studying human gastrointestinal biology.                Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

31138163        	An image-based assay to quantify changes in proliferation and viability upon drug treatment in 3D microenvironments.            	Every biological experiment requires a choice of throughput balanced against physiological relevance. Most primary drug screens neglect critical parameters such as microenvironmental conditions, cell-cell heterogeneity, and specific readouts of cell fate for the sake of throughput.                Here we describe a methodology to quantify proliferation and viability of single cells in 3D culture conditions by leveraging automated microscopy and image analysis to facilitate reliable and high-throughput measurements. We detail experimental conditions that can be adjusted to increase either throughput or robustness of the assay, and we provide a stand alone image analysis program for users who wish to implement this 3D drug screening assay in high throughput.                We demonstrate this approach by evaluating a combination of RAF and MEK inhibitors on melanoma cells, showing that cells cultured in 3D collagen-based matrices are more sensitive than cells grown in 2D culture, and that cell proliferation is much more sensitive than cell viability. We also find that cells grown in 3D cultured spheroids exhibit equivalent sensitivity to single cells grown in 3D collagen, suggesting that for the case of melanoma, a 3D single cell model may be equally effective for drug identification as 3D spheroids models. The single cell resolution of this approach enables stratification of heterogeneous populations of cells into differentially responsive subtypes upon drug treatment, which we demonstrate by determining the effect of RAK/MEK inhibition on melanoma cells co-cultured with fibroblasts. Furthermore, we show that spheroids grown from single cells exhibit dramatic heterogeneity to drug response, suggesting that heritable drug resistance can arise stochastically in single cells but be retained by subsequent generations.                In summary, image-based analysis renders cell fate detection robust, sensitive, and high-throughput, enabling cell fate evaluation of single cells in more complex microenvironmental conditions.

32934222        	A phospho-switch controls RNF43-mediated degradation of Wnt receptors to suppress tumorigenesis.            	Frequent mutation of the tumour suppressor RNF43 is observed in many cancers, particularly colon malignancies. RNF43, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates Wnt signalling by inducing degradation of the Wnt receptor Frizzled. In this study, we discover that RNF43 activity requires phosphorylation at a triplet of conserved serines. This phospho-regulation of RNF43 is required for zebrafish development and growth of mouse intestinal organoids. Cancer-associated mutations that abrogate RNF43 phosphorylation cooperate with active Ras to promote tumorigenesis by abolishing the inhibitory function of RNF43 in Wnt signalling while maintaining its inhibitory function in p53 signalling. Our data suggest that RNF43 mutations cooperate with KRAS mutations to promote multi-step tumorigenesis via the Wnt-Ras-p53 axis in human colon cancers. Lastly, phosphomimetic substitutions of the serine trio restored the tumour suppressive activity of extracellular oncogenic mutants. Therefore, harnessing phospho-regulation of RNF43 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for tumours with RNF43 mutations.	
32968051        	Heme oxygenase 1 protects human colonocytes against ROS formation, oxidative DNA damage and cytotoxicity induced by heme iron, but not inorganic iron.            	The consumption of red meat is probably carcinogenic to humans and is associated with an increased risk to develop colorectal cancer (CRC). Red meat contains high amounts of heme iron, which is thought to play a causal role in tumor formation. In this study, we investigated the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of heme iron (i.e., hemin) versus inorganic iron in human colonic epithelial cells (HCEC), human CRC cell lines and murine intestinal organoids. Hemin catalyzed the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced oxidative DNA damage as well as DNA strand breaks in both HCEC and CRC cells. In contrast, inorganic iron hardly affected ROS levels and only slightly increased DNA damage. Hemin, but not inorganic iron, caused cell death and reduced cell viability. This occurred preferentially in non-malignant HCEC, which was corroborated in intestinal organoids. Both hemin and inorganic iron were taken up into HCEC and CRC cells, however with differential kinetics and efficiency. Hemin caused stabilization and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and ferritin heavy chain (FtH). This was not observed after inorganic iron treatment. Chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of HO-1 potentiated hemin-triggered ROS generation and oxidative DNA damage preferentially in HCEC. Furthermore, HO-1 abrogation strongly augmented the cytotoxic effects of hemin in HCEC, revealing its pivotal function in colonocytes and highlighting the toxicity of free intracellular heme iron. Taken together, this study demonstrated that hemin, but not inorganic iron, induces ROS and DNA damage, resulting in a preferential cytotoxicity in non-malignant intestinal epithelial cells. Importantly, HO-1 conferred protection against the detrimental effects of hemin.	
24525510        	Fibrous hamartoma of infancy: a clinicopathologic analysis of 60 cases.            	Fibrous hamartoma of infancy is a benign soft tissue tumor with a characteristic triphasic organoid histologic appearance. It typically occurs within the first 2 years of life. The usual anatomic locations include the upper extremities, axilla, and upper back. Diagnostic challenges occur when this tumor arises in older children, outside of the usual anatomic sites, or when unusual histologic features are encountered. This study reports 60 cases of fibrous hamartoma of infancy from institutional and consultation files. All had a triphasic organoid histologic pattern, but half also displayed an unusual pseudoangiomatous histologic pattern. The male to female ratio was 2.0 (40 boys, 20 girls), with a mean age of 1.5 years (range, 16 d to 8 y) at diagnosis. Tumor size ranged from 0.5 to 9 cm, with a mean of 3.7 cm. Sites included the trunk (40 cases), extremities (17 cases), and head and neck (3 cases). All cases had triphasic elements of mature fibrous tissue, mature adipose tissue, and immature mesenchymal tissue in varying proportions, with the additional pseudoangiomatous pattern in 32 cases. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated reactivity for smooth muscle actin and CD34 in the mature fibrous tissue, S100 protein in the mature adipose tissue, and variable CD34 reactivity in immature mesenchymal and pseudoangiomatous foci. Ki-67 proliferative activity was noted in the immature mesenchymal and pseudoangiomatous foci, and Bcl-2 reactivity was restricted to mesenchymal and pseudoangiomatous foci. Follow-up information in 12 cases revealed no evidence of recurrence in 10 patients and local recurrence in 2 patients, each at 3.5 years after primary excision. This study demonstrates an expanded age range (up to 8 y) and anatomic distribution (30 cases outside of the classic locations of the upper extremities, axilla, and upper back) of fibrous hamartoma of infancy. The pseudoangiomatous morphologic variation can lead to challenges in diagnosis and may reflect a maturational phenomenon from the immature mesenchymal component.	
25934696        	HIC1 Tumor Suppressor Loss Potentiates TLR2/NF-κB Signaling and Promotes Tissue Damage-Associated Tumorigenesis.            	Hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) represents a prototypic tumor suppressor gene frequently inactivated by DNA methylation in many types of solid tumors. The gene encodes a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor controlling expression of several genes involved in cell cycle or stress control. In this study, a Hic1 allele was conditionally deleted, using a Cre/loxP system, to identify genes influenced by the loss of Hic1. One of the transcripts upregulated upon Hic1 ablation is the toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Tlr2 expression levels increased in Hic1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and cultured intestinal organoids or in human cells upon HIC1 knockdown. In addition, HIC1 associated with the TLR2 gene regulatory elements, as detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation, indicating that Tlr2 indeed represents a direct Hic1 target. The Tlr2 receptor senses "danger" signals of microbial or endogenous origin to trigger multiple signaling pathways, including NF-κB signaling. Interestingly, Hic1 deficiency promoted NF-κB pathway activity not only in cells stimulated with Tlr2 ligand, but also in cells treated with NF-κB activators that stimulate different surface receptors. In the intestine, Hic1 is mainly expressed in differentiated epithelial cells and its ablation leads to increased Tlr2 production. Finally, in a chemical-induced mouse model of carcinogenesis, Hic1 absence resulted in larger Tlr2-positive colonic tumors that showed increased proportion of proliferating cells.                The tumor-suppressive function of Hic1 in colon is related to its inhibitory action on proproliferative signaling mediated by the Tlr2 receptor present on tumor cells.                ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.	
24507101        	[Clinicopathologic features of combined hepatic carcinoma].            	To investigate clinicopathological features of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (C-HCC-CC) with neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) differentiation and to review the literature.                The clinical data, histological manifestations and immunohistochemical staining results of two cases of C-HCC-CC were analyzed along with a review of the current literature.                Both patients were male with an average age of 57.5 years. Both patients were positive for hepatitis B virus antigen. The tumors of both cases demonstrated the following 3 unequivocal mixed elements: (1) polygonal epithelial tumor cells growing in nests or trabeculae with positive staining for Hepatocyte and AFP, diagnostic of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cytoplasmic bile production was present in the tumor cells in one case; (2) elliptic or short spindle-shape small blue tumor cells growing in nests or organoid pattern with Syn/CgA/CD56 positivity confirming the presence of neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) component; (3) oval tumor cells growing in nests or glandular forms with positivity of CK19 and CK7 confirming differentiation of cholangiocarcinoma (CC). In both cases, the tumors contained at least 20% of each of HCC, NEC and CC components.                C-HCC-CC with NEC is a rare form of primary malignancy of the liver with a poor prognosis.	
33082117        	The molecular basis of mammary gland development and epithelial differentiation.            	Our understanding of the molecular events underpinning the development of mammalian organ systems has been increasing rapidly in recent years. With the advent of new and improved next-generation sequencing methods, we are now able to dig deeper than ever before into the genomic and epigenomic events that play critical roles in determining the fates of stem and progenitor cells during the development of an embryo into an adult. In this review, we detail and discuss the genes and pathways that are involved in mammary gland development, from embryogenesis, through maturation into an adult gland, to the role of pregnancy signals in directing the terminal maturation of the mammary gland into a milk producing organ that can nurture the offspring. We also provide an overview of the latest research in the single-cell genomics of mammary gland development, which may help us to understand the lineage commitment of mammary stem cells (MaSCs) into luminal or basal epithelial cells that constitute the mammary gland. Finally, we summarize the use of 3D organoid cultures as a model system to study the molecular events during mammary gland development. Our increased investigation of the molecular requirements for normal mammary gland development will advance the discovery of targets to predict breast cancer risk and the development of new breast cancer therapies.

32916121        	Androgen Maintains Intestinal Homeostasis by Inhibiting BMP Signaling via Intestinal Stromal Cells.            	Research shows a higher incidence of colorectal cancer in men. However, the molecular mechanisms for this gender disparity remain unknown. We report the roles of androgen in proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells via targeting of the androgen receptor (AR) on intestinal stromal cells by negatively regulating BMP signaling. Orchidectomy (ORX) or the AR antagonist promotes expansion of intestinal epithelium but suppresses intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. Conversely, the AR agonist inhibits ISC differentiation but augments proliferation in ovariectomized mice. Mechanistically, activation of the AR increases expression of BMP antagonists but lowers expression of BMP4 and Wnt antagonists in primary stromal cells, which promotes intestinal organoid growth. Interestingly, the BMP pathway inhibitor LDN-193189 reverses the ORX-induced effects. Our results highlight that stromal cells constitute the intestinal stem cell niche and provide a possible explanation for higher incidence rates of colorectal cancer in men.

28794917        	Microfluidic device for primary tumor spheroid isolation.            	Traditional two-dimensional (2-D) monolayer cell culture is vastly different from in vivo physiological conditions, which can lead to inaccurate or insufficient data in areas where response and efficacy within humans are being investigated, such as drug discovery, pathology studies, etc. Misleading results arise from two main disadvantages of monolayer cell culture. First, after several passages, cell lines lose many features from their original in vivo state. Second, the morphology of cells cultured in a monolayer is much different from the cell morphology in three-dimensional (3-D) in vivo conditions, thus resulting in altered cellular function. Three-dimensional multi-cellular spheroids, on the other hand, are a better representation of in vivo physiological conditions while still retaining many of the in vitro cell culture advantages. Primary spheroids freshly isolated from tissue samples are especially ideal for cell-based assays by avoiding the two problems of 2-D monolayer cell culture.                In this paper, we report a microfluidic device for primary tumor spheroid isolation. Pancreatic tumor samples from mice were used in the experiments.                We successfully isolated primary tumor spheroids from the pancreatic tumor samples and were able to maintain the spheroids in culture for up to two weeks.                This novel microfluidic device may promote and advance the isolation of primary tumor spheroids for future drug testing and interrogation of tumor characteristics.	
32899370        	Insights into Differentiation of Melanocytes from Human Stem Cells and Their Relevance for Melanoma Treatment.            	Malignant melanoma represents a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. The metastatic process itself is mostly governed by the so-called epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which confers cancer cells migrative, invasive and resistance abilities. Since EMT represents a conserved developmental process, it is worthwhile further examining the nature of early developmental steps fundamental for melanocyte differentiation. This can be done either in vivo by analyzing the physiologic embryo development in different species or by in vitro studies of melanocytic differentiation originating from embryonic human stem cells. Most importantly, external cues drive progenitor cell differentiation, which can be divided in stages favoring neural crest specification or melanocytic differentiation and proliferation. In this review, we describe ectopic factors which drive human pluripotent stem cell differentiation to melanocytes in 2D, as well as in organoid models. Furthermore, we compare developmental mechanisms with processes described to occur during melanoma development. Finally, we suggest differentiation factors as potential co-treatment options for metastatic melanoma patients.	
32855996        	Three-Dimensional Printed Stamps for the Fabrication of Patterned Microwells and High-Throughput Production of Homogeneous Cell Spheroids.            	Aggregation of cells into spheroids and organoids is a promising tool for regenerative medicine, cancer and cell biology, and drug discovery due to their recapitulation of the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions found in vivo. Traditional approaches for the production of spheroids, such as the hanging drop method, are limited by the lack of reproducibility and the use of labor-intensive and time-consuming techniques. The need for high-throughput approaches allowing for the quick and reproducible formation of cell aggregates has driven the development of soft lithography techniques based on the patterning of microwells into nonadherent hydrogels. However, these methods are also limited by costly, labor-intensive, and multistep protocols that could impact the sterility of the process and efficiency of spheroid formation. In this study, we describe a one-step method for the fabrication of patterned nonadherent microwells into tissue culture plates using three-dimensional (3D) printed stamps and evaluate the production of cell spheroids of different sizes and cell sources. The generation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell and endothelial cell spheroids by the use of 3D printed stamps was superior in comparison with a widely used multistep mold technique, yielding spheroids of larger sizes and higher DNA content. The 3D stamps produced spheroids of more consistent diameter and DNA content when compared with other commercially available methods. These 3D printed stamps offer a tunable, simple, fast, and cost-effective approach for the production of reproducible spheroids and organoids for a wide range of applications.

31004447        	Circular RNA MAT2B Promotes Glycolysis and Malignancy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Through the miR-338-3p/PKM2 Axis Under Hypoxic Stress.            	Glucose metabolism reprogramming, which is a well-established characteristic of multiple cancers, demands a higher rate of glycolysis to meet the increasing demands for macromolecular synthesis and to maintain rapid proliferation in a hypoxic environment. However, the mechanism underlying this switch remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the function of circular RNA MAT2B (circMAT2B) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) glucose metabolism reprogramming and malignancy. CircMAT2B was identified by bioinformatics analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus data sets. CircMAT2B expression was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. HCC patients with high circMAT2B expression had shortened overall survival. We analyzed the positive correlation between glycolysis and circMAT2B expression in HCC using a maximum standardized uptake value determined by preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography scanning combined with high-performance liquid chromatography assessment of the metabolites of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. The effect of circMAT2B on glycolysis was validated in vitro and in vivo under hypoxic (1% O2 ) conditions. Functional assays were performed in HCC cells, HCC organoids, and nude mice to explore the tumor-promoting roles of circMAT2B in HCC. Biotin-coupled probe pull-down assays, biotin-coupled microRNA capture, luciferase reporter assays, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to confirm the interaction among different RNAs. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that circMAT2B up-regulated expression levels of the microRNA (miR)-338-3p target gene PKM2, which encodes a key enzyme in the process of glycolysis, through "sponging" miR-338-3p; thus, glycolysis and HCC progression are promoted through this mechanism. Conclusion: CircMAT2B promoted HCC progression by enhanced glycolysis by activating the circMAT2B/miR-338-3p/PKM2 axis under hypoxia, which may provide a therapeutic target for HCC.                © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.	
33417832        	An Embryonic Diapause-like Adaptation with Suppressed Myc Activity Enables Tumor Treatment Persistence.            	Treatment-persistent residual tumors impede curative cancer therapy. To understand this cancer cell state we generated models of treatment persistence that simulate the residual tumors. We observe that treatment-persistent tumor cells in organoids, xenografts, and cancer patients adopt a distinct and reversible transcriptional program resembling that of embryonic diapause, a dormant stage of suspended development triggered by stress and associated with suppressed Myc activity and overall biosynthesis. In cancer cells, depleting Myc or inhibiting Brd4, a Myc transcriptional co-activator, attenuates drug cytotoxicity through a dormant diapause-like adaptation with reduced apoptotic priming. Conversely, inducible Myc upregulation enhances acute chemotherapeutic activity. Maintaining residual cells in dormancy after chemotherapy by inhibiting Myc activity or interfering with the diapause-like adaptation by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 9 represent potential therapeutic strategies against chemotherapy-persistent tumor cells. Our study demonstrates that cancer co-opts a mechanism similar to diapause with adaptive inactivation of Myc to persist during treatment.                Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

23621858        	Nevoid follicular mucinosis: a new type of hair follicle nevus.            	Follicular mucinosis represents a term for a histopathologic reaction pattern in follicular epithelium. It is a characteristic of alopecia mucinosa. However, it may also occur in a variety of unrelated conditions. Epidermal nevi are considered to be hamartomatous disorders and they can show a predominant component of non-organoid (keratinocytes) and/or organoid nevi. All the cases of epidermal nevi described with mucin deposits until now are reported as mucinous nevus or mucinous eccrine nevus; in the first type of disorder, diffuse mucin deposition is only seen in the papillary dermis, and in the second type, the mucin is found around the proliferation of eccrine structures. We believe this is the first reported case of epidermal nevus along Blaschko's lines exhibiting typical microscopic findings of mucinosis exclusively distributed inside the follicular epithelia.                 © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

25291874        	"Pure" primary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the urinary bladder: case report, literature review and diagnostic criteria.            	Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNC) is defined in the urinary bladder, as in other sites, as a high-grade neoplasm exhibiting neuroendocrine features at the H&E level, high mitotic activity and evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation by immunohistochemistry. We report a case of pure bladder LCNC with review of the literature.                A 68-year-old male presented with gross haematuria of two weeks' duration in October 2011. Transurethral resection and subsequently radical cystoprostatectomy (CP) with bilateral lymphadenectomy (L) were performed in December 2012.                Urinary cytology identified malignant cells. Histologically, the tumour showed organoid nesting, trabecular growth, rosettes and perilobular palisading patterns, suggesting neuroendocrine differentiation. Immunohistochemical staining showed intense positivity for CD56.                We examined all published pure bladder LCNC (12 cases) excluding mixed neoplasms. Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder pure LCNC of the bladder is a very aggressive malignancy, unresponsive to therapy, presents in an advanced stage and has a propensity for early metastasis. Prior to the advent of immunohistochemistry, such cases would most likely have been categorised as poorly differentiated, high-grade urothelial carcinomas.	
33371210        	Rapalink-1 Targets Glioblastoma Stem Cells and Acts Synergistically with Tumor Treating Fields to Reduce Resistance against Temozolomide.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal disease with limited clinical treatment options available. Recently, a new inhibitor targeting the prominent cancer signaling pathway mTOR was discovered (Rapalink-1), but its therapeutic potential on stem cell populations of GBM is unknown. We applied a collection of physiological relevant organoid-like stem cell models of GBM and studied the effect of RL1 exposure on various cellular features as well as on the expression of mTOR signaling targets and stem cell molecules. We also undertook combination treatments with this agent and clinical GBM treatments tumor treating fields (TTFields) and the standard-of-care drug temozolomide, TMZ. Low nanomolar (nM) RL1 treatment significantly reduced cell growth, proliferation, migration, and clonogenic potential of our stem cell models. It acted synergistically to reduce cell growth when applied in combination with TMZ and TTFields. We performed an in silico analysis from the molecular data of diverse patient samples to probe for a relationship between the expression of mTOR genes, and mesenchymal markers in different GBM cohorts. We supported the in silico results with correlative protein data retrieved from tumor specimens. Our study further validates mTOR signaling as a druggable target in GBM and supports RL1, representing a promising therapeutic target in brain oncology.	
29329231        	Development of a Cytocompatible Scaffold from Pig Immature Testicular Tissue Allowing Human Sertoli Cell Attachment, Proliferation and Functionality.            	Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue before chemo/radiotherapy is the only option to preserve fertility of cancer-affected prepubertal boys. To avoid reintroduction of malignant cells, development of a transplantable scaffold by decellularization of pig immature testicular tissue (ITT) able to support decontaminated testicular cells could be an option for fertility restoration in these patients. We, therefore, compared decellularization protocols to produce a cytocompatible scaffold. Fragments of ITT from 15 piglets were decellularized using three protocols: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-Triton (ST), Triton-SDS-Triton (TST) and trypsin 0.05%/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 0.02%-Triton (TET) with varying detergent concentrations. All protocols were able to lower DNA levels. Collagen retention was demonstrated in all groups except ST 1%, and a significant decrease in glycosaminoglycans was observed in the TST 1% and TET 1% groups. When Sertoli cells (SCs) were cultured with decellularized tissue, no signs of cytotoxicity were detected. A higher SC proliferation rate and greater stem cell factor secretion were observed than with SCs cultured without scaffold. ST 0.01% and TET 3% conditions offered the best compromise in terms of DNA elimination and extracellular matrix (ECM) preservation, while ensuring good attachment, proliferation and functionality of human SCs. This study demonstrates the potential of using decellularized pig ITT for human testicular tissue engineering purposes.	
33558271        	Prostaglandin E2 receptor PTGER4-expressing macrophages promote intestinal epithelial barrier regeneration upon inflammation.            	Dysfunctional resolution of intestinal inflammation and altered mucosal healing are essential features in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal macrophages are vital in the process of inflammation resolution, but the mechanisms underlying their mucosal healing capacity remain elusive.                We investigated the role of the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor PTGER4 on the differentiation of intestinal macrophages in patients with IBD and mouse models of intestinal inflammation. We studied mucosal healing and intestinal epithelial barrier regeneration in Csf1r-iCre Ptger4fl/fl mice during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The effect of PTGER4+ macrophage secreted molecules was investigated on epithelial organoid differentiation.                Here, we describe a subset of PTGER4-expressing intestinal macrophages with mucosal healing properties both in humans and mice. Csf1r-iCre Ptger4fl/fl mice showed defective mucosal healing and epithelial barrier regeneration in a model of DSS colitis. Mechanistically, an increased mucosal level of PGE2 triggers chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) secretion in monocyte-derived PTGER4+ macrophages via mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). CXCL1 drives epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation from regenerating crypts during colitis. Specific therapeutic targeting of macrophages with liposomes loaded with an MAPK agonist augmented the production of CXCL1 in vivo in conditional macrophage PTGER4-deficient mice, restoring their defective epithelial regeneration and favouring mucosal healing.                PTGER4+ intestinal macrophages are essential for supporting the intestinal stem cell niche and regeneration of the injured epithelium. Our results pave the way for the development of a new class of therapeutic targets to promote macrophage healing functions and favour remission in patients with IBD.                © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

31322431        	NOTCH signaling promotes the survival of irradiated basal airway stem cells.            	Radiation-induced lung injury to normal airway epithelium is a frequent side-effect and dose-limiting factor in radiotherapy of tumors in the thoracic cavity. NOTCH signaling plays key roles in self-renewal and differentiation of upper airway basal lung stem cells during development, and the NOTCH pathway is frequently deregulated in lung cancer. In preclinical lung cancer models, NOTCH inhibition was shown to improve the radiotherapy response by targeting tumor stem cells, but the effects in combination with irradiation on normal lung stem cells are unknown. NOTCH/γ-secretase inhibitors are potent clinical candidates to block NOTCH function in tumors, but their clinical implementation has been hampered by normal tissue side-effects. Here we show that NOTCH signaling is active in primary human- and murine-derived airway epithelial stem cell models and when combined with radiation NOTCH inhibition provokes a decrease in S-phase and increase in G1-phase arrest. We show that NOTCH inhibition in irradiated lung basal stem cells leads to a more potent activation of the DNA damage checkpoint kinases pATM and pCHK2 and results in an increased level of residual 53BP1 foci in irradiated lung basal stem cells reducing their capacity for self-renewal. The effects are recapitulated in ex vivo cultured lung basal stem cells after in vivo whole thorax irradiation and NOTCH inhibition. These results highlight the importance of studying normal tissue effects that may counteract the therapeutic benefit in the use of NOTCH/γ-secretase inhibitors in combination with radiation for antitumor treatment.	
24958732        	Activated K-RAS and its effect on morphological appearance.            	RAS genes are frequently mutated in various human tumours. These mutations cause GTPase RAS to remain locked in constitutively active signals through the downstream cascades leading to proliferation. A series of earlier studies reported on the morphological appearance of cells upon RAS activation. Classically, morphologic changes of fibroblasts have been used to confirm the oncogenic activity of RAS. Recent works found that the active RAS induces benign and malignant morphological changes in organoids, which are an in vitro model system for epithelial tissue. The studies of animal models support the basic oncogenic features of RAS revealed in vitro, while also providing evidence that the effects of RAS activation in vivo are different from those in vitro. The pathological observation of the various human materials indicates that the oncogenic RAS participates in metaplasia, which occurs before proliferation, and that RAS promotes mucin production in various organs. These morphological analyses may shed light on important signalling pathways that merit investigation in vitro.                 © The Authors 2014.

32943183        	Mitochondria transfer from tumor-activated stromal cells (TASC) to primary Glioblastoma cells.            	The tumor microenvironment (TME) controls many aspects of cancer development but little is known about its effect in Glioblastoma (GBM), the main brain tumor in adults. Tumor-activated stromal cell (TASC) population, a component of TME in GBM, was induced in vitro by incubation of MSCs with culture media conditioned by primary cultures of GBM under 3D/organoid conditions. We observed mitochondrial transfer by Tunneling Nanotubes (TNT), extracellular vesicles (EV) and cannibalism from the TASC to GBM and analyzed its effect on both proliferation and survival. We created primary cultures of GBM or TASC in which we have eliminated mitochondrial DNA [Rho 0 (ρ0) cells]. We found that TASC, as described in other cancers, increased GBM proliferation and resistance to standard treatments (radiotherapy and chemotherapy). We analyzed the incorporation of purified mitochondria by ρ0 and ρ+ cells and a derived mathematical model taught us that ρ+ cells incorporate more rapidly pure mitochondria than ρ0 cells.

33571711        	Epithelial Regeneration After Doxorubicin Arises Primarily From Early Progeny of Active Intestinal Stem Cells.            	aISCs (aISCs) are sensitive to acute insults including chemotherapy and irradiation. Regeneration after aISC depletion has primarily been explored in irradiation (IR). However, the cellular origin of epithelial regeneration after doxorubicin (DXR), a common chemotherapeutic, is poorly understood.                We monitored DXR's effect on aISCs by enumerating Lgr5-eGFP+ and Olfm4+ crypts, cleaved caspase-3 (CASP3+) immunofluorescence, and time-lapse organoid imaging. Lineage tracing from previously identified regenerative cell populations (Bmi1+, Hopx+, Dll1+, and Defa6+) was performed with DXR damage. Lineage tracing from aISCs was compared with lineage tracing from early progeny cells (transit-amplifying cells arising from aISCs 1 day predamage) in the context of DXR and IR. We compared stem cell and DNA damage response (DDR) transcripts in isolated aISCs and early progeny cells 6 and 24 hours after DXR.                Epithelial regeneration after DXR primarily arose from early progeny cells generated by aISCs. Early progeny cells upregulated stem cell gene expression and lacked apoptosis induction (6 hours DXR: 2.5% of CASP3+ cells, p<0.0001). aISCs downregulated stem cell gene expression and underwent rapid apoptosis (6 hours DXR: 63.4% of CASP3+ cells). There was minimal regenerative contribution from Bmi1+, Hopx+, Dll1+, and Defa6+-expressing populations. In homeostasis, 48.4% of early progeny cells were BrdU+, and expressed low levels of DDR transcripts.                We show that DXR effectively depleted aISCs in the small intestine and subsequent epithelial regeneration depended on nonquiescent early progeny cells of aISCs. The chemoresistant phenotype of the early progeny cells may rely on a dampened DDR in contrast to aISCs' robust DDR, which facilitates expeditious apoptosis.

31723131        	eIF4A supports an oncogenic translation program in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal malignancy with limited treatment options. Although metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of many cancers, including PDA, previous attempts to target metabolic changes therapeutically have been stymied by drug toxicity and tumour cell plasticity. Here, we show that PDA cells engage an eIF4F-dependent translation program that supports redox and central carbon metabolism. Inhibition of the eIF4F subunit, eIF4A, using the synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) reduced the viability of PDA organoids relative to their normal counterparts. In vivo, CR-31 suppresses tumour growth and extends survival of genetically-engineered murine models of PDA. Surprisingly, inhibition of eIF4A also induces glutamine reductive carboxylation. As a consequence, combined targeting of eIF4A and glutaminase activity more effectively inhibits PDA cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of eIF4A in translational control of pancreatic tumour metabolism and as a therapeutic target against PDA.	
23381206        	Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung: is it possible to diagnose from biopsy specimens?            	We have recently proposed new diagnostic criteria for high-grade non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, i.e. possible large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, in biopsy specimens and have started a clinicopathological comparative study of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas in an advanced stage. This study aimed to elucidate the usefulness of our diagnostic criteria for inoperable advanced large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and to know the true incidence of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma among lung cancers.                We reviewed all cancer lesions (1040 specimens) obtained by transbronchial lung biopsies in our hospital from 2002 to 2009 and selected 38 biopsy specimens that satisfied our diagnostic criteria for high-grade non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. All 38 cases were clinicopathologically investigated and all biopsy specimens were precisely studied for their morphological characteristics.                Clinicopathological information about the selected 38 cases was very similar to the clinicopathological characteristics of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma reported. Of 38 cases, six were at Stage I, II or IIIA, underwent surgery, and the diagnosis was confirmed to be large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma using surgical tumor specimens. In the 38 biopsy specimens, features of neuroendocrine morphology such as organoid nesting, peripheral palisading and rosette formation were not frequent histological features and the majority of tumor cells contained nuclei with a fine chromatin pattern. Mitoses were difficult to find; however, immunohistochemical Ki-67/MIB1 labeling indices were quite useful for evaluating proliferative activity, which ranged from 43.4 to 99.0%.                Our study showed the diagnostic potential of using biopsy specimens for large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and we herein proposed more simplified diagnostic criteria for possible large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in practical diagnostic use.

31416916        	Cell phenotypic plasticity requires autophagic flux driven by YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction.            	Autophagy, besides ensuring energy metabolism and organelle renewal, is crucial for the biology of adult normal and cancer stem cells. However, it remains incompletely understood how autophagy connects to stemness factors and the nature of the microenvironmental signals that pattern autophagy in different cell types. Here we advance in these directions by reporting that YAP/TAZ transcriptionally control autophagy, being critical for autophagosomal degradation into autolysosomes. YAP/TAZ are downstream effectors of cellular mechanotransduction and indeed we found that cell mechanics, dictated by the physical property of the ECM and cytoskeletal tension, profoundly impact on autophagic flux in a YAP/TAZ-mediated manner. Functionally, by using pancreatic and mammary organoid cultures, we found that YAP/TAZ-regulated autophagy is essential in normal cells for YAP/TAZ-mediated dedifferentiation and acquisition of self-renewing properties. In tumor cells, the YAP/TAZ-autophagy connection is key to sustain transformed traits and for acquisition of a cancer stem cell state by otherwise more benign cells. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ promote autophagic flux by directly promoting the expression of Armus, a RAB7-GAP required for autophagosome turnover and whose add-back rescues autophagy in YAP/TAZ-depleted cells. These findings expand the influence of YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction to the control of autophagy and, vice versa, the role of autophagy in YAP/TAZ biology, and suggest a mechanism to coordinate transcriptional rewiring with cytoplasmic restructuring during cell reprogramming.	
31085283        	DNA Damage Response After Ionizing Radiation Exposure in Skin Keratinocytes Derived from Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.            	Epidermal cells are positioned on the body surface and thus risk being exposed to genotoxic stress, including ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet rays, and chemical compounds. The biological effect of IR on the skin tissue is a significant problem for medical applications such as radiation therapy. Keratinocyte stem cells and progenitors are at risk for IR-dependent tumorigenesis during radiation therapy for cancer treatment. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of genome stability in epidermal cells, we derived skin keratinocytes from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and analyzed their DNA damage response (DDR).                Skin keratinocytes were derived from iPSCs and designated as first- (P1), second- (P2), and third- (P3) passage cells to compare the differentiation states of DDR. After 2 Gy gamma-ray exposure, cells were immunostained with DNA double-strand break markers γ-H2AX/53BP1 and cell senescence markers p16/p21 for DDR analysis. DDR protein expression level, cell survival, and apoptosis were analyzed by western blotting, WST-8 assay and TUNEL assay, respectively. DDR of constructed 3D organoid modeling was also analyzed.                P1, P2, and P3 keratinocytes were characterized with keratinocyte markers keratin 14 and p63 using immunofluorescence, and all cells were positive to both markers. Derived keratinocytes showed high expression of integrin α6 and CD71 (real-time (qRT)-PCR ratio: iPSCs: integrin α6: 1.12, CD71: 1.25, P1: integrin α6: 7.80, CD71: 0.43, P2: integrin α6: 5.53, CD71: 0.48), suggesting that P1 and P2 keratinocytes have potential as keratinocyte progenitors. Meanwhile, P3 keratinocytes showed low expression of integrin α6 and CD71 (qRT-PCR ratio: P3: integrin α6: 0.55, CD71: 0.10), suggesting differentiated keratinocytes. After IR exposure, the P1 and P2 keratinocytes showed an increase in DNA repair activity by a γ-H2AX/53BP1 focus assay (P1: γ-H2AX: 28.0%, 53BP1: 17.0%, P2: γ-H2AX: 37.7%, 53BP1: 28.3%) but not in P3 keratinocytes (P3: γ-H2AX: 74.7%, 53BP1: 63.7%) compared with iPSCs (γ-H2AX: 57.0%, 53BP1: 55.0%). Furthermore, in derived keratinocytes, expression of the cellular senescence markers p16 and p21 were increased compared with iPSCs (P16: non irradiated, iPSCs: 0%, P1: 12.5%, P2: 14.5%, P3: 29.7%, IR, iPSCs: 0%, P1: 19.5%, P2: 34.8%, P3: 64.5%). DDR protein expression, cellular sensitivity, and apoptosis activity decreased in derived keratinocytes compared with iPSCs.                We have demonstrated the derivation of keratinocytes from iPSCs and their characterization of differentiated states and DDR. Derived keratinocytes showed progenitors like character as a result of DDR. These results suggest that derived keratinocytes are useful tools for analyzing the effects of IR, such as DDR on the skin tissue from radiation therapy for cancer.

26279575        	Amino Acid Activation of mTORC1 by a PB1-Domain-Driven Kinase Complex Cascade.            	The mTORC1 complex is central to the cellular response to changes in nutrient availability. The signaling adaptor p62 contributes to mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids and interacts with TRAF6, which is required for the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosome and the subsequent K63 polyubiquitination and activation of mTOR. However, the signal initiating these p62-driven processes was previously unknown. Here, we show that p62 is phosphorylated via a cascade that includes MEK3/6 and p38δ and is driven by the PB1-containing kinase MEKK3. This phosphorylation results in the recruitment of TRAF6 to p62, the ubiquitination and activation of mTOR, and the regulation of autophagy and cell proliferation. Genetic inactivation of MEKK3 or p38δ mimics that of p62 in that it leads to inhibited growth of PTEN-deficient prostate organoids. Analysis of human prostate cancer samples showed upregulation of these three components of the pathway, which correlated with enhanced mTORC1 activation.                 Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

32989128        	Metabolic precision labeling enables selective probing of O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine glycosylation.            	Protein glycosylation events that happen early in the secretory pathway are often dysregulated during tumorigenesis. These events can be probed, in principle, by monosaccharides with bioorthogonal tags that would ideally be specific for distinct glycan subtypes. However, metabolic interconversion into other monosaccharides drastically reduces such specificity in the living cell. Here, we use a structure-based design process to develop the monosaccharide probe N-(S)-azidopropionylgalactosamine (GalNAzMe) that is specific for cancer-relevant Ser/Thr(O)-linked N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) glycosylation. By virtue of a branched N-acylamide side chain, GalNAzMe is not interconverted by epimerization to the corresponding N-acetylglucosamine analog by the epimerase N-acetylgalactosamine-4-epimerase (GALE) like conventional GalNAc-based probes. GalNAzMe enters O-GalNAc glycosylation but does not enter other major cell surface glycan types including Asn(N)-linked glycans. We transfect cells with the engineered pyrophosphorylase mut-AGX1 to biosynthesize the nucleotide-sugar donor uridine diphosphate (UDP)-GalNAzMe from a sugar-1-phosphate precursor. Tagged with a bioorthogonal azide group, GalNAzMe serves as an O-glycan-specific reporter in superresolution microscopy, chemical glycoproteomics, a genome-wide CRISPR-knockout (CRISPR-KO) screen, and imaging of intestinal organoids. Additional ectopic expression of an engineered glycosyltransferase, "bump-and-hole" (BH)-GalNAc-T2, boosts labeling in a programmable fashion by increasing incorporation of GalNAzMe into the cell surface glycoproteome. Alleviating the need for GALE-KO cells in metabolic labeling experiments, GalNAzMe is a precision tool that allows a detailed view into the biology of a major type of cancer-relevant protein glycosylation.

32888483        	A Biosensor for the Mitotic Kinase MPS1 Reveals Spatiotemporal Activity Dynamics and Regulation.            	Accurate chromosome segregation during cell division critically depends on error correction of chromosome-spindle interactions and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) [1-3]. The kinase MPS1 is an essential regulator of both processes, ensuring full chromosome biorientation before anaphase onset [3, 4]. To understand when and where MPS1 activation occurs and how MPS1 signaling is modulated during mitosis, we developed MPS1sen, a sensitive and specific FRET-based biosensor for MPS1 activity. By placing MPS1sen at different subcellular locations, we show that MPS1 activity initiates in the nucleus ∼9-12 min prior to nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) in a kinetochore-dependent manner and reaches the cytoplasm at the start of NEB. Soon after initiation, MPS1 activity increases with switch-like kinetics, peaking at completion of NEB. We further show that timing and extent of pre-NEB MPS1 activity is regulated by Aurora B and PP2A-B56. MPS1sen phosphorylation declines in prometaphase as a result of formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments, reaching low but still detectable levels at metaphase. Finally, leveraging the sensitivity and dynamic range of MPS1sen, we show deregulated MPS1 signaling dynamics in colorectal cancer cell lines and tumor organoids with diverse genomic instability phenotypes.

32371580        	DCLK1-Isoform2 Alternative Splice Variant Promotes Pancreatic Tumor Immunosuppressive M2-Macrophage Polarization.            	Tumor-associated M2-macrophages are one of the most abundant immunosuppressive cell types in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the generation of M2-macrophages are unclear. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of DCLK1-isoform2 in AsPC1 and MIA PaCa2 cells resulted in the polarization of M1-macrophages toward an M2 phenotype via secreted chemokines/cytokines. These M2-macrophages enhanced parental PDAC cell migration, invasion, and self-renewal, and this was associated with increased expression of Snail and Slug. We observed distinct expression of Dclk-isoform2, marked infiltration of M2-macrophages, and a marginal increase of CD8+ T cells in 20-week-old KPCY mice pancreas compared with 5 weeks old. Utilizing an autochthonous mouse model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, we observed distinct immunoreactive Dclk1 and arginase1 in tissues where CD8+ T-cell infiltration was low and observed a paucity of DCLK1 and arginase1 staining where CD8+ T-cell infiltration was high. Finally, we found that DCLK1-isoform2 tumor-educated M2-macrophages inhibit CD8+ T-cell proliferation and granzyme-B activation. Inhibition of DCLK1 in an organoid coculture system enhanced CD8+ T-cell activation and associated organoid death. We conclude that DCLK1-isoform2 is a novel initiator of alternate macrophage activation that contributes to the immunosuppression observed in the PDAC TME. These data suggest that tumor DCLK1-isoform2 may be an attractive target for PDAC therapy, either alone or in conjunction with immunotherapeutic strategies.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
31610028        	Overriding Adaptive Resistance to Sorafenib Through Combination Therapy With Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing Phosphatase 2 Blockade in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.            	The survival benefit of sorafenib for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unsatisfactory due to the development of adaptive resistance. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that drug resistance can be acquired by cancer cells by activating a number of signaling pathways through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs); nevertheless, the detailed mechanism for the activation of these alternative pathways is not fully understood.                Given the physiological role of Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) as a downstream effector of many RTKs for activation of various signaling cascades, we first found that SHP2 was markedly up-regulated in our established sorafenib-resistant cell lines as well as patient-derived xenografts. Upon sorafenib treatment, adaptive resistance was acquired in HCC cells through activation of RTKs including AXL, epidermal growth factor receptor, EPH receptor A2, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, leading to RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and AKT reactivation. We found that the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 abrogated sorafenib resistance in HCC cell lines and organoid culture in vitro by blocking this negative feedback mechanism. Interestingly, this sensitization effect was also mediated by induction of cellular senescence. SHP099 in combination with sorafenib was highly efficacious in the treatment of xenografts and genetically engineered models of HCC.                SHP2 blockade by SHP099 in combination with sorafenib attenuated the adaptive resistance to sorafenib by impeding RTK-induced reactivation of the MEK/ERK and AKT signaling pathways. SHP099 in combination with sorafenib may be a safe therapeutic strategy against HCC.                © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.	
32291395        	DICER1-associated central nervous system sarcoma in children: comprehensive clinicopathologic and genetic analysis of a newly described rare tumor.            	The spectrum of neoplasms associated with DICER1 variants continues to expand, with the recent addition of primary "DICER1-associated central nervous system sarcoma" (DCS). DCS is a high-grade malignancy predominantly affecting pediatric patients. Six pediatric DCS were identified through a combination of clinical diagnostic studies, archival inquiry, and interinstitutional collaboration. Clinical, histologic, immunohistologic, and molecular features were examined. Genomic findings in the 6 DCS were compared with those in 14 additional DICER1-associated tumors sequenced with the same assay. The six patients presented at ages 3-15 years with CNS tumors located in the temporal (n = 2), parietal (n = 1), fronto-parietal (n = 1), and frontal (n = 2) lobes. All underwent surgical resection. Histologic examination demonstrated high-grade malignant spindle cell tumors with pleuropulmonary blastoma-like embryonic "organoid" features and focal rhabdomyoblastic differentiation; immature cartilage was seen in one case. Immunohistochemically, there was patchy desmin and myogenin staining, and patchy loss of H3K27me3, and within eosinophilic cytoplasmic globules, alfa-fetoprotein staining. Biallelic DICER1 variants were identified in all cases, with germline variants in two of five patients tested. DCS demonstrated genomic alterations enriched for Ras pathway activation and TP53 inactivation. Tumor mutational burden was significantly higher in the 6 DCS tumors than in 14 other DICER1-associated tumors examined (mean 12.9 vs. 6.8 mutations/Mb, p = 0.035). Postoperative care included radiation (n = 5) and chemotherapy (n = 3); at the last follow-up, three patients were alive without DCS, and three had died of disease. Our analysis expands the clinical, histologic, immunohistological, and molecular spectrum of DCS, identifying distinctive features that can aid in the diagnosis, multidisciplinary evaluation, and treatment of DCS.	
27489532        	Preclinical models for interrogating drug action in human cancers using Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM).            	In this review we compare the advantages and disadvantages of different model biological systems for determining the metabolic functions of cells in complex environments, how they may change in different disease states, and respond to therapeutic interventions.                All preclinical drug-testing models have advantages and drawbacks. We compare and contrast established cell, organoid and animal models with ex vivo organ or tissue culture and in vivo human experiments in the context of metabolic readout of drug efficacy. As metabolism reports directly on the biochemical state of cells and tissues, it can be very sensitive to drugs and/or other environmental changes. This is especially so when metabolic activities are probed by stable isotope tracing methods, which can also provide detailed mechanistic information on drug action. We have developed and been applying Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM) to examine metabolic reprogramming of human lung cancer cells in monoculture, in mouse xenograft/explant models, and in lung cancer patients in situ (Lane et al. 2011; T. W. Fan et al. 2011; T. W-M. Fan et al. 2012; T. W. Fan et al. 2012; Xie et al. 2014b; Ren et al. 2014a; Sellers et al. 2015b). We are able to determine the influence of the tumor microenvironment using these models. We have now extended the range of models to fresh human tissue slices, similar to those originally described by O. Warburg (Warburg 1923), which retain the native tissue architecture and heterogeneity with a paired benign versus cancer design under defined cell culture conditions. This platform offers an unprecedented human tissue model for preclinical studies on metabolic reprogramming of human cancer cells in their tissue context, and response to drug treatment (Xie et al. 2014a). As the microenvironment of the target human tissue is retained and individual patient's response to drugs is obtained, this platform promises to transcend current limitations of drug selection for clinical trials or treatments.                Development of ex vivo human tissue and animal models with humanized organs including bone marrow and liver show considerable promise for analyzing drug responses that are more relevant to humans. Similarly using stable isotope tracer methods with these improved models in advanced stages of the drug development pipeline, in conjunction with tissue biopsy is expected significantly to reduce the high failure rate of experimental drugs in Phase II and III clinical trials.	
29477614        	Recent Advances in Lgr5+ Stem Cell Research.            	The discovery of leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) as both a marker of adult stem cells and a critical modulator of their activity via its role as an effector of Wnt/R-spondin (Rspo) signaling has driven major advances in our understanding of stem cell biology during homeostasis, regeneration, and disease. Exciting new mouse and organoid culture models developed to study the endogenous behavior of Lgr5-expressing cells in health and disease settings have revealed the existence of facultative stem cell populations responsible for tissue regeneration, cancer stem cells (CSCs) driving metastasis in the gut, and Lgr5+ niche cells in the lung. Here we review these recent advances and discuss their impact on efforts to harness the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells and their cancer counterparts in the clinic.

32094348        	Suppressing STAT5 signaling affects osteosarcoma growth and stemness.            	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone tumor that primarily affects children and adolescents. Studies suggested that dysregulation JAK/STAT signaling promotes the development of OS. Cells treated with pimozide, a STAT5 inhibitor suppressed proliferation and colony formation and induced sub G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. There was a reduction in cyclin D1 and CDK2 expression and Rb phosphorylation, and activation of Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. In addition, pimozide suppressed the formation of 3-dimensional osteospheres and growth of the cells in the Tumor in a Dish lung organoid system. Furthermore, there was a reduction in expression of cancer stem cell marker proteins DCLK1, CD44, CD133, Oct-4, and ABCG2. More importantly, it was the short form of DCLK1 that was upregulated in osteospheres, which was suppressed in response to pimozide. We further confirmed by flow cytometry a reduction in DCLK1+ cells. Moreover, pimozide inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT5, STAT3, and ERK in OS cells. Molecular docking studies suggest that pimozide interacts with STAT5A and STAT5B with binding energies of -8.4 and -6.4 Kcal/mol, respectively. Binding was confirmed by cellular thermal shift assay. To further understand the role of STAT5, we knocked down the two isoforms using specific siRNAs. While knockdown of the proteins did not affect the cells, knockdown of STAT5B reduced pimozide-induced necrosis and further enhanced late apoptosis. To determine the effect of pimozide on tumor growth in vivo, we administered pimozide intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 mg/kg BW every day for 21 days in mice carrying KHOS/NP tumor xenografts. Pimozide treatment significantly suppressed xenograft growth. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses also demonstrated significant inhibition of stem cell marker proteins. Together, these data suggest that pimozide treatment suppresses OS growth by targeting both proliferating cells and stem cells at least in part by inhibiting the STAT5 signaling pathway.	
30586936        	Circulating Tumor Cell-Derived Pre-Clinical Models for Personalized Medicine.            	The main cause of death from cancer is associated with the development of metastases, resulting from the inability of current therapies to cure patients at metastatic stages. Generating preclinical models to better characterize the evolution of the disease is thus of utmost importance, in order to implement effective new cancer biomarkers and therapies. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are good candidates for generating preclinical models, making it possible to follow up the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of tumor tissues. This method is a non-invasive liquid biopsy that can be obtained at any stage of the disease. It partially summarizes the molecular heterogeneity of the corresponding tumors at a given time. Here, we discuss the CTC-derived models that have been generated so far, from simplified 2D cultures to the most complex CTC-derived explants (CDX models). We highlight the challenges and strengths of these preclinical tools, as well as some of the recent studies published using these models.	
33419241        	An Integrated In Silico and In Vivo Approach to Identify Protective Effects of Palonosetron in Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity.            	Cisplatin is widely used to treat various types of cancers, but it is often limited by nephrotoxicity. Here, we employed an integrated in silico and in vivo approach to identify potential treatments for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN). Using publicly available mouse kidney and human kidney organoid transcriptome datasets, we first identified a 208-gene expression signature for CIN and then used the bioinformatics database Cmap and Lincs Unified Environment (CLUE) to identify drugs expected to counter the expression signature for CIN. We also searched the adverse event database, Food and Drug Administration. Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), to identify drugs that reduce the reporting odds ratio of developing cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. Palonosetron, a serotonin type 3 receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (5-HT3R)) antagonist, was identified by both CLUE and FAERS analyses. Notably, clinical data from 103 patients treated with cisplatin for head and neck cancer revealed that palonosetron was superior to ramosetron in suppressing cisplatin-induced increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Moreover, palonosetron significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish exposed to cisplatin but not to other 5-HT3R antagonists. These results not only suggest that palonosetron can suppress CIN but also support the use of in silico and in vivo approaches in drug repositioning studies.	
32612752        	Software tools for 3D nuclei segmentation and quantitative analysis in multicellular aggregates.            	Today, we are fully immersed into the era of 3D biology. It has been extensively demonstrated that 3D models: (a) better mimic the physiology of human tissues; (b) can effectively replace animal models; (c) often provide more reliable results than 2D ones. Accordingly, anti-cancer drug screenings and toxicology studies based on multicellular 3D biological models, the so-called "-oids" (e.g. spheroids, tumoroids, organoids), are blooming in the literature. However, the complex nature of these systems limit the manual quantitative analyses of single cells' behaviour in the culture. Accordingly, the demand for advanced software tools that are able to perform phenotypic analysis is fundamental. In this work, we describe the freely accessible tools that are currently available for biologists and researchers interested in analysing the effects of drugs/treatments on 3D multicellular -oids at a single-cell resolution level. In addition, using publicly available nuclear stained datasets we quantitatively compare the segmentation performance of 9 specific tools.                © 2020 The Authors.	figshare                                            10.6084/m9.figshare.3184546
28813673        	Multipotent Basal Stem Cells, Maintained in Localized Proximal Niches, Support Directed Long-Ranging Epithelial Flows in Human Prostates.            	Sporadic mitochondrial DNA mutations serve as clonal marks providing access to the identity and lineage potential of stem cells within human tissues. By combining quantitative clonal mapping with 3D reconstruction of adult human prostates, we show that multipotent basal stem cells, confined to discrete niches in juxta-urethral ducts, generate bipotent basal progenitors in directed epithelial migration streams. Basal progenitors are then dispersed throughout the entire glandular network, dividing and differentiating to replenish the loss of apoptotic luminal cells. Rare lineage-restricted luminal stem cells, and their progeny, are confined to proximal ducts and provide only minor contribution to epithelial homeostasis. In situ cell capture from clonal maps identified delta homolog 1 (DLK1) enrichment of basal stem cells, which was validated in functional spheroid assays. This study establishes significant insights into niche organization and function of prostate stem and progenitor cells, with implications for disease.                Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

28670477        	Ex vivo tumor culture systems for functional drug testing and therapy response prediction.            	Optimal patient stratification is of utmost importance in the era of personalized medicine. Prediction of individual treatment responses by functional ex vivo assays requires model systems derived from viable tumor samples, which should closely resemble in vivo tumor characteristics and microenvironment. This review discusses a broad spectrum of model systems, ranging from classic 2D monolayer culture techniques to more experimental 'cancer-on-chip' procedures. We mainly focus on organotypic tumor slices that take tumor heterogeneity and tumor-stromal interactions into account. These 3D model systems can be exploited for patient selection as well as for fundamental research. Selection of the right model system for each specific research endeavor is crucial and requires careful balancing of the pros and cons of each technology.	
31058900        	Predicting In Vivo Payloads Delivery using a Blood-brain Tumor-barrier in a Dish.            	Highly selective by nature, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for the brain homeostasis in physiological conditions. However, in the context of brain tumors, the molecular selectivity of BBB also shields the neoplastic cells by blocking the delivery of peripherally administered chemotherapies. The development of novel drugs (including nanoparticles) targeting malignant brain tumors ideally requires the use of preclinical animal models to study the drug's transcytosis and antitumor efficacy. In order to comply with the 3R principle (refine, reduce, and replace) to reduce the number of laboratory animals in experimental setup and perform the high-throughput screening of a large library of antitumor agents, we developed a reproducible in vitro human and murine mimic of the blood-brain tumor-barrier (BBTB) using three-layered cultures of endothelial cells, astrocytes, and patient-derived glioblastoma spheres. For higher scalability and reproducibility, commercial cell lines or immortalized cells have been used in tailored conditions to allow the formation of a barrier resembling the actual BBB. Here we describe a protocol to obtain a BBTB mimic by culturing endothelial cells in contact with astrocytes at specific cell densities on inserts. This BBTB mimic can be used, for instance, for the quantification and confocal imaging of the nanoparticle passage through the endothelial and astrocytic barriers, in addition to the evaluation of the tumor cell targeting within the same assay. Moreover, we show that the obtained data can be used to predict the behavior of nanoparticles in preclinical animal models. In a broader perspective, this in vitro model could be adapted to other neurodegenerative diseases for the determination of the passage of new therapeutic molecules through the BBB and/or be supplemented with brain organoids to directly evaluate the efficacy of drugs.	
27698479        	Multiphoton imaging reveals that nanosecond pulsed electric fields collapse tumor and normal vascular perfusion in human glioblastoma xenografts.            	Despite the biomedical advances of the last century, many cancers including glioblastoma are still resistant to existing therapies leaving patients with poor prognoses. Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) are a promising technology for the treatment of cancer that have thus far been evaluated in vitro and in superficial malignancies. In this paper, we develop a tumor organoid model of glioblastoma and apply intravital multiphoton microscopy to assess their response to nsPEFs. We demonstrate for the first time that a single 10 ns, high voltage electric pulse (35-45 kV/cm), collapses the perfusion of neovasculature, and also alters the diameter of capillaries and larger vessels in normal tissue. These results contribute to the fundamental understanding of nsPEF effects in complex tissue environments, and confirm the potential of nsPEFs to disrupt the microenvironment of solid tumors such as glioblastoma.	
23400231        	A case of alveolar soft part sarcoma of the pleura.            	Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare malignant soft-tissue neoplasm of unknown histogenesis. The two main sites of occurrence are the lower extremities in adults and the head and neck in children. We report the first case of pleural ASPS occurring in a 58-yr-old man who presented with progressive dyspnea. A computed tomographic scan of the thorax revealed a large enhancing pleural mass with pleural effusion in the left hemithorax. Wide excision of the pleural mass was performed. Histologically, the tumor consisted of organoid nests of large polygonal cells, the cytoplasm of which had eosinophilic and D-PAS positive granules. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor cell nuclei were positive for transcription factor 3 (TFE3). The pleural ASPS with multiple bone metastases recurred 1 yr after surgery and the patient died of acute pulmonary embolism 1.5 yr after diagnosis.	
33309857        	Galactosyltransferase B4GALT1 confers chemoresistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas by upregulating N-linked glycosylation of CDK11p110.            	Aberrant glycosylation in pancreatic cancer has been linked to cancer development, progression and chemoresistance. However, the role of glycogene, such as galactosyltransferase, in pancreatic cancer remains unknown. Herein, we establish beta-1.4-galactosyltransferase 1 (B4GALT1) as a clinical marker and regulator of chemoresistance. Clinically, high B4GALT1 expression correlates with poor survival, enhanced tumor size, increased lymph node metastasis, elevated cancer progression and enhanced incidence of relapse in PDAC patients. Expression of B4GALT1 is up-regulated in gemcitabine resistant patient derived organoids as well as chemoresistant cancer cell lines, while genetic perturbation of its expression in PDAC cell lines regulates cancer progression and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, we show that elevated p65 activity transcriptionally up-regulates B4GALT1 expression, which then interacts with and stabilizes cyclin dependent kinase 11 isomer CDK11p110 protein via N-linked glycosylation, in order to promote cancer progression and chemoresistance. Finally, depletion of B4GALT1 rescues the response of chemoresistant cells to gemcitabine in an orthotopic PDAC model. Overall, our data uncovers a mechanism by which p65-B4GALT1-CDK11p110 signalling axis determines cancer progression and chemoresistance, providing a new therapeutic target for an improved pancreatic cancer treatment.

23166433        	Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica without extracutaneous abnormalities: a case study involving a preterm baby.            	Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica (PPK) is a rare syndrome defined by the association of an organoid nevus occasionally with sebaceous differentiation, a speckled lentiginous nevus, and other extracutaneous anomalies. A preterm male infant of only 830 g at 27 week gestational age had an organoid nevus showing sebaceous differentiation. Also, he had multiple speckled-lentiginous nevus. Correlating the observed clinical presentation with the histopathological findings, the diagnosis of PPK was established. There have been less than 10 cases of PPK without extracutaneous manifestation. We present an uncommon case of a preterm patient with PPK who had no extracutaneous abnormalities.	
33649470        	Evidence that polyploidy in esophageal adenocarcinoma originates from mitotic slippage caused by defective chromosome attachments.            	Polyploidy is present in many cancer types and is increasingly recognized as an important factor in promoting chromosomal instability, genome evolution, and heterogeneity in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms that trigger polyploidy in cancer cells are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the origin of polyploidy in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a highly heterogenous cancer, using a combination of genomics and cell biology approaches in EAC cell lines, organoids, and tumors. We found the EAC cells and organoids present specific mitotic defects consistent with problems in the attachment of chromosomes to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Time-lapse analyses confirmed that EAC cells have problems in congressing and aligning their chromosomes, which can ultimately culminate in mitotic slippage and polyploidy. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and quantitative immunofluorescence analyses revealed alterations in the copy number, expression, and cellular distribution of several proteins known to be involved in the mechanics and regulation of chromosome dynamics during mitosis. Together, these results provide evidence that an imbalance in the amount of proteins implicated in the attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules is the molecular mechanism underlying mitotic slippage in EAC. Our findings that the likely origin of polyploidy in EAC is mitotic failure caused by problems in chromosomal attachments not only improves our understanding of cancer evolution and diversification, but may also aid in the classification and treatment of EAC and possibly other highly heterogeneous cancers.	
33232189        	Liquid biopsy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and exosomes.            	Introduction: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Due to a lack of reliable markers, HNSCC patients are usually diagnosed at a late stage, which will lead to a worse outcome. Therefore, it is critical to improve the clinical management of cancer patients. Nowadays, the development of liquid biopsy enables a minimally invasive manner to extract molecular information from HNSCCs. Thus, this review aims to outline the clinical value of liquid biopsy in early detection, real-time monitoring, and prognostic evaluation of HNSCC. Areas covered: This comprehensive review focused on the characteristics as well as clinical applications of three liquid biopsy markers (CTCs, ctDNA, and exosomes) in HNSCC. What is more, it is promising to incorporate machine learning and 3D organoid models in the liquid biopsy of HNSCC. Expert opinion: Liquid biopsy provides a noninvasive technique to reflect the inter and intra-lesional heterogeneity through the detection of tumor cells or materials released from the primary and secondary tumors. Recently, some evolving technologies have the potential to combine with liquid biopsy to improve clinical management of HNSCC patients.	
20204626        	Isolation, culture and analysis of mouse mammary epithelial cells.            	Limited understanding of the cell biology of the breast and breast cancer hampers our ability to develop new therapeutic approaches. Mouse models of mammary gland development and tumourigenesis are key to developing new insights into the biology of both the normal and diseased tissues. Recent advances have enabled the isolation, molecular characterisation and functional analysis of mouse mammary epithelial cell subpopulations from the normal gland, including subpopulations enriched for stem cell behaviour. Application of these techniques both to the normal mammary gland and to tumour models will promote a better understanding of the nature of the different epithelial cell types in the mammary gland, the origins of mammary tumours and the role of tumour stem cells.	
32219176        	ACADL plays a tumor-suppressor role by targeting Hippo/YAP signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.            	Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of fatty acid oxidation, but the role of ACADL in tumor biology remains largely unknown. Here, we found that ACADL was frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its low expression was significantly correlated with poor clinical prognosis of HCC patients. Restoring the expression of ACADL in HCC cells resulted cell cycle arrest and growth suppression through suppressing Hippo/YAP signaling evidenced by decreased YAP nuclear accumulation and downstream target genes expression. Reactivation of YAP by XMU-MP-1 diminished the inhibitory effect of ACADL on HCC growth. More importantly, the nuclear accumulation of YAP was negatively correlated with ACADL expression levels in HCC specimens, and YAP inhibitor verteporfin effectively suppressed growth of HCC organoids with low ACADL expression. Together, our findings highlight a novel function of ACADL in regulating HCC growth and targeting ACADL/Yap may be a potential strategy for HCC precise treatment.                © The Author(s) 2020.

31934213        	Micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma: report of two cases and review of literature.            	Micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma (MNT) is a rare subtype of organoid thymic epithelial tumor that occurs in middle-aged and elderly people. Histologically, MNT is characterized by multiple epithelial nodules that are scattered or fused and abundant lymphocyte stroma with prominent germinal centers. It has a benign course and a good prognosis, and its diagnosis mainly depends on histopathologic and immunohistochemical markers. This article reports two cases of MNT to explore its clinicopathologic features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis to improve understanding of this subtype. In addition, we review previously reported cases of MNT.                IJCEP Copyright © 2019.	
24144315        	3D in vitro tissue models and their potential for drug screening.            	The development of one standard, simplified in vitro three-dimensional tissue model suitable to biological and pathological investigation and drug-discovery may not yet be feasible, but standardized models for individual tissues or organs are a possibility. Tissue bioengineering, while concerned with finding methods of restoring functionality in disease, is developing technology that can be miniaturized for high throughput screening (HTS) of putative drugs. Through collaboration between biologists, physicists and engineers, cell-based assays are expanding into the realm of tissue analysis. Accordingly, three-dimensional (3D) micro-organoid systems will play an increasing role in drug testing and therapeutics over the next decade. Nevertheless, important hurdles remain before these models are fully developed for HTS.                We highlight advances in the field of tissue bioengineering aimed at enhancing the success of drug candidates through pre-clinical optimization. We discuss models that are most amenable to high throughput screening with emphasis on detection platforms and data modeling.                Modeling 3D tissues to mimic in-vivo architecture remains a major challenge. As technology advances to provide novel methods of HTS analysis, so do potential pitfalls associated with such models and methods. We remain hopeful that integration of biofabrication with HTS will significantly reduce attrition rates in drug development.	
25052837        	Bone mechanobiology, gravity and tissue engineering: effects and insights.            	Bone homeostasis strongly depends on fine tuned mechanosensitive regulation signals from environmental forces into biochemical responses. Similar to the ageing process, during spaceflights an altered mechanotransduction occurs as a result of the effects of bone unloading, eventually leading to loss of functional tissue. Although spaceflights represent the best environment to investigate near-zero gravity effects, there are major limitations for setting up experimental analysis. A more feasible approach to analyse the effects of reduced mechanostimulation on the bone is represented by the 'simulated microgravity' experiments based on: (1) in vitro studies, involving cell cultures studies and the use of bioreactors with tissue engineering approaches; (2) in vivo studies, based on animal models; and (3) direct analysis on human beings, as in the case of the bed rest tests. At present, advanced tissue engineering methods allow investigators to recreate bone microenvironment in vitro for mechanobiology studies. This group and others have generated tissue 'organoids' to mimic in vitro the in vivo bone environment and to study the alteration cells can go through when subjected to unloading. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the bone tissue response to mechanostimuli will help developing new strategies to prevent loss of tissue caused by altered mechanotransduction, as well as identifying new approaches for the treatment of diseases via drug testing. This review focuses on the effects of reduced gravity on bone mechanobiology by providing the up-to-date and state of the art on the available data by drawing a parallel with the suitable tissue engineering systems.

26093648        	Mutational analysis of MED12 in fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors of the breast by means of targeted next-generation sequencing.            	We aimed to analyze MED12 mutation in fibroadenomas (FAs) and phyllodes tumors (PTs) of the breast, which are closely related and consist of epithelial and stromal components. Targeted deep-sequencing using next-generation sequencing was performed in FAs (n = 58) and PTs (n = 27). The frequency of MED12 mutant tumors was significantly higher (P = 0.016) in PTs (74.1 %) than in FAs. (46.6 %). As for FAs, this frequency was significantly higher (P = 0.001) for intracanalicular type (69.0 %) than for other histological subtypes such as pericanalicular, organoid, and mastopathic types (24.1 %). Laser microdissection study revealed that stromal cells, but not epithelial cells, harbored MED12 mutations in both FAs and PTs. MED12 mutation is implicated in the pathogenesis of both FAs and PTs. The similarly high frequency of MED12 mutation in intracanalicular type FAs suggests that they are most closely related to PTs. It is thus speculated that FAs with MED12 mutation are more likely to progress to PTs.	
31770366        	Loss of adenomatous polyposis coli function renders intestinal epithelial cells resistant to the cytokine IL-22.            	Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a critical immune defence cytokine that maintains intestinal homeostasis and promotes wound healing and tissue regeneration, which can support the growth of colorectal tumours. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc) are a major driver of familial colorectal cancers (CRCs). How IL-22 contributes to APC-mediated tumorigenesis is poorly understood. To investigate IL-22 signalling in wild-type (WT) and APC-mutant cells, we performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of IL-22-treated murine small intestinal epithelial organoids. In WT epithelia, antimicrobial defence and cellular stress response pathways were most strongly induced by IL-22. Surprisingly, although IL-22 activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in APC-mutant cells, STAT3 target genes were not induced. Our analyses revealed that ApcMin/Min cells are resistant to IL-22 due to reduced expression of the IL-22 receptor, and increased expression of inhibitors of STAT3, particularly histone deacetylases (HDACs). We further show that IL-22 increases DNA damage and genomic instability, which can accelerate cellular transition from heterozygosity (ApcMin/+) to homozygosity (ApcMin/Min) to drive tumour formation. Our data reveal an unexpected role for IL-22 in promoting early tumorigenesis while excluding a function for IL-22 in transformed epithelial cells.	
27558284        	Characterization of mammary epithelial stem/progenitor cells and their changes with aging in common marmosets.            	Age is the number one risk factor for breast cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms are unexplored. Age-associated mammary stem cell (MaSC) dysfunction is thought to play an important role in breast cancer carcinogenesis. Non-human primates with their close phylogenetic relationship to humans provide a powerful model system to study the effects of aging on human MaSC. In particular, the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) with a relatively short life span is an ideal model for aging research. In the present study, we characterized for the first time the mammary epithelial stem/progenitor cells in the common marmoset. The MaSC-enriched cells formed four major types of morphologically distinct colonies when cultured on plates pre-seeded with irradiated NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and were also capable of forming mammospheres in suspension culture and subsequent formation of 3D organoids in Matrigel culture. Most importantly, these 3D organoids were found to contain stem/progenitor cells that can undergo self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. We also observed a significant decrease of luminal-restricted progenitors with age. Our findings demonstrate that common marmoset mammary stem/progenitor cells can be isolated and quantified with established in vitro and in vivo assays used for mouse and human studies.	
21797918        	Two histopathologic patterns of well-differentiated extraocular sebaceous carcinoma.            	No previous reports on the variation in the histopathological patterns of well-differentiated sebaceous carcinoma are yet to be published.                We reviewed the histopathology of six examples of well-differentiated extraocular sebaceous carcinoma.                Two distinct histopathological patterns of sebaceous carcinoma, namely a secretory pattern (N = 2) and a non-secretory pattern (N = 4), were defined. The secretory pattern is typified by sebaceous lobular architecture with focal holocrine secretion, whereas the non-secretory pattern lacks this organoid quality. Both carcinomas with the secretory pattern showed low-grade cytological atypia, whereas the four carcinomas with the non-secretory pattern included three lesions with high-grade cytological atypia. A sebaceous adenoma-like area was seen in both secretory pattern carcinomas, whereas a focus of intraepithelial sebaceous carcinoma (sebaceous carcinoma in situ) was seen in two of the non-secretory pattern carcinomas.                The clinicopathological significance of the two histopathological patterns remains unclear, because the number of reported cases is limited. It is possible that these two histopathological patterns of carcinoma have different histogenetic and prognostic implications, but no definitive conclusions can be made until further studies of a larger number of cases can be completed.

25153353        	Experimental teratoma: at the crossroad of fetal- and onco-development.            	Xenografting is the so far only available in vivo model for assessing pluripotency of human stem cells. This review describes known biological features of experimental teratoma from human pluripotent stem cells. We focus on the dual nature mimicking both normal and abnormal development, and propose this model system to be particularly interesting for investigations of the relationship between developmentally controlled differentiation and neoplasia of embryonic origin. In resemblance to the wide range of clinical teratomas, pluripotent stem cell (PSC) induced teratoma (PSCT) typically shows a mixture of developing tissues in randomly distributed compartments. The combined literature suggests that for teratomas derived from human diploid bona fide PSC the embryonic development in the separate tissue-niches can show a controlled differentiation into organoid patterns closely mimicking early development. In the experimental situation such PSCT human homologous in vivo tissue-niches have been shown to provide also matching microenvironment for a micrometastatic colonization and outgrowth of embryonic tumors transplanted directly from patients. Single or small clusters of normal and neoplastic cells can easily be visualized together in microscope-based imaging systems, enabling multi-parameter detection of in the scans of tissue slides/specimens.

26456970        	Müllerianosis with Intestinal Metaplasia: A Case Report.            	Müllerianosis or Müllerian choristomas are developmental alterations that consist of an organoid structure with normal Müllerian tissue. We present a 62-year-old patient diagnosed on ultrasound scanning and on CT scan of bilateral ovarian cysts. During surgery, a left ovarian cyst and retroperitoneal tumor (adhered to sigmoid serous surface) were found. On histological examination, the tumor corresponded with a Müllerian choristoma showing endometrial, endosalpingeal and endocervical epithelium, with foci of intestinal metaplasia, a phenomenon not described in the literature.	
28527574        	Nuclear Receptor TLX in Development and Diseases.            	The nuclear receptor TLX (NR2E1) is a transcription factor that is critical for neural development and adult neurogenesis through its actions in regulating neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal, and fate determination. These roles are primarily executed by regulating TLX downstream target genes involved in myriad pathways such as cell cycle progression, RNA processing, angiogenesis, and senescence. Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of TLX pathways plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human neurological disorders and brain tumors. Here, we will highlight recent progress in the roles of TLX in brain development and adult neurogenesis, and the relevance of TLX to neurological diseases and brain tumors. We will also discuss the potential of TLX as a therapeutic target for these disorders.                © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
30620551        	Selective Small-Molecule Targeting of a Triple Helix Encoded by the Long Noncoding RNA, MALAT1.            	Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ( Malat1/ MALAT1, mouse/human), a highly conserved long noncoding (lnc) RNA, has been linked with several physiological processes, including the alternative splicing, nuclear organization, and epigenetic modulation of gene expression. MALAT1 has also been implicated in metastasis and tumor proliferation in multiple cancer types. The 3' terminal stability element for nuclear expression (ENE) assumes a triple-helical configuration that promotes its nuclear accumulation and persistent function. Utilizing a novel small molecule microarray strategy, we identified multiple Malat1 ENE triplex-binding chemotypes, among which compounds 5 and 16 reduced Malat1 RNA levels and branching morphogenesis in a mammary tumor organoid model. Computational modeling and Förster resonance energy transfer experiments demonstrate distinct binding modes for each chemotype, conferring opposing structural changes to the triplex. Compound 5 modulates Malat1 downstream genes without affecting Neat1, a nuclear lncRNA encoded in the same chromosomal region as Malat1 with a structurally similar ENE triplex. Supporting this observation, the specificity of compound 5 for Malat1 over Neat1 and a virus-coded ENE was demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Small molecules specifically targeting the MALAT1 ENE triplex lay the foundation for new classes of anticancer therapeutics and molecular probes for the treatment and investigation of MALAT1-driven cancers.	
24758504        	[Where does Ewing sarcoma end and begin - two cases of unusual bone tumors with t(20;22)(EWSR1-NFATc2) alteration].            	The authors present two cases of Ewing-like sarcoma of the humerus and femur of a 12-year-old boy and a 28-year-old male, respectively. Identical morphology in both tumors consisted of multiple solid nests with a mosaic collection of small, round, uniform cells with clear cytoplasm and no apparent nuclear atypia. A monotonous structural arrangement, including both rich vascularity of bordering septae and significant admixtures of eosinophil leucocytes, resulted in a final organoid "neuroendocrine-like" pattern. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse strong CD10, CD99 and CD138 positivity. Detailed molecular analysis in both tumors confirmed translocation t(20;22) resulting in an EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion gene. Additionally, this translocation was accompanied by amplification of the proximal part of the genes and surrounding areas. Clinically, both neoplasms behaved aggressively and they were primarily chemoresistant. Four years later, the patient with the lesion in the humerus developed a massive local recurrence with a disruption of osteosynthesis. The last follow-up disclosed suspicious metastatic deposits in the lung. The boy with the femoral tumor underwent a total femoral prosthesis and there are no signs of local or systemic recurrence after 11 months of follow-up. The authors discuss the taxonomic placement of these rare examples of Ewing-like sarcoma family in the light of new molecular discoveries.	
30453596        	Factors Affecting Intracellular Delivery and Release of Hydrophilic Versus Hydrophobic Cargo from Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles on 2D and 3D Cell Cultures.            	Intracellular drug delivery by mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) carrying hydrophilic and hydrophobic fluorophores as model drug cargo is demonstrated on 2D cellular and 3D tumor organoid level. Two different MSN designs, chosen on the basis of the characteristics of the loaded cargo, were used: MSNs with a surface-grown poly(ethylene imine), PEI, coating only for hydrophobic cargo and MSNs with lipid bilayers covalently coupled to the PEI layer as a diffusion barrier for hydrophilic cargo. First, the effect of hydrophobicity corresponding to loading degree (hydrophobic cargo) as well as surface charge (hydrophilic cargo) on intracellular drug release was studied on the cellular level. All incorporated agents were able to release to varying degrees from the endosomes into the cytoplasm in a loading degree (hydrophobic) or surface charge (hydrophilic) dependent manner as detected by live cell imaging. When administered to organotypic 3D tumor models, the hydrophilic versus hydrophobic cargo-carrying MSNs showed remarkable differences in labeling efficiency, which in this case also corresponds to drug delivery efficacy in 3D. The obtained results could thus indicate design aspects to be taken into account for the development of efficacious intracellular drug delivery systems, especially in the translation from standard 2D culture to more biologically relevant organotypic 3D cultures.	
32536682        	Genome Engineering Evolves Brain Tumor Modeling.            	Genome engineering using programmable nucleases such as transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated protein nine facilitated the introduction of genetic alterations at specific genomic sites in various cell types. These tools have been applied to cancer modeling to understand the pathogenic effects of the growing catalog of mutations found in human cancers. Pertaining to brain tumors, neural progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) engineered with different combinations of genetic driver mutations observed in distinct molecular subtypes of glioblastomas, the most common form of primary brain cancer in adults, give rise to brain tumors when engrafted orthotopically in mice. These glioblastoma models recapitulate the transcriptomic signature of each molecular subtype and authentically resemble pathobiology of glioblastoma, including inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, chromosomal aberrations, and extrachromosomal DNA amplifications. Similar engineering with genetic mutations found in medulloblastoma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors in iPSCs have led to genetically trackable models that bear clinical relevance to these pediatric brain tumors. These models have contributed to improved comprehension of the genetic causation of tumorigenesis and offered a novel platform for therapeutic discovery. Studied in the context of three-dimensional cerebral organoids, these models have aided in the study of tumor invasion as well as therapeutic responses. In summary, modeling brain tumors through genome engineering enables not only the establishment of authentic tumor avatars driven by bona fide genetic mutations observed in patient samples but also facilitates functional investigations of particular genetic alterations in an otherwise isogenic background.	
32787463        	An overview of neuroblastoma cell lineage phenotypes and in vitro models.            	This review was conducted to present the main neuroblastoma (NB) clinical characteristics and the most common genetic alterations present in these pediatric tumors, highlighting their impact in tumor cell aggressiveness behavior, including metastatic development and treatment resistance, and patients' prognosis. The distinct three NB cell lineage phenotypes, S-type, N-type, and I-type, which are characterized by unique cell surface markers and gene expression patterns, are also reviewed. Finally, an overview of the most used NB cell lines currently available for in vitro studies and their unique cellular and molecular characteristics, which should be taken into account for the selection of the most appropriate model for NB pre-clinical studies, is presented. These valuable models can be complemented by the generation of NB reprogrammed tumor cells or organoids, derived directly from patients' tumor specimens, in the direction toward personalized medicine.	
32610043        	Critical Role of Type III Interferon in Controlling SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells.            	Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented worldwide health problem that requires concerted and global approaches to stop the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). Our results demonstrate that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and production of infectious de novo virus particles. We found that viral infection elicits an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where interferon-mediated responses are efficient at controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and de novo virus production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hIECs are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing to increasing patient viremia and fueling an exacerbated cytokine response.

29449562        	Chir99021 and Valproic acid reduce the proliferative advantage of Apc mutant cells.            	More than 90% of colorectal cancers carry mutations in Apc that drive tumourigenesis. A 'just-right' signalling model proposes that Apc mutations stimulate optimal, but not excessive Wnt signalling, resulting in a growth advantage of Apc mutant over wild-type cells. Reversal of this growth advantage constitutes a potential therapeutic approach. We utilised intestinal organoids to compare the growth of Apc mutant and wild-type cells. Organoids derived from Apc Min/+ mice recapitulate stages of intestinal polyposis in culture. They eventually form spherical cysts that reflect the competitive growth advantage of cells that have undergone loss of heterozygosity (LOH). We discovered that this emergence of cysts was inhibited by Chiron99021 and Valproic acid, which potentiates Wnt signalling. Chiron99021 and Valproic acid restrict the growth advantage of Apc mutant cells while stimulating that of wild-type cells, suggesting that excessive Wnt signalling reduces the relative fitness of Apc mutant cells. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated that Chiron99021-treated Apc mutant organoids were rendered susceptible to TSA-induced apoptosis, while wild-type cells were protected.	
28257659        	Comprehensive assessment of Cucurbitacin E related hepatotoxicity and drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A and P-glycoprotein.            	Cucurbitacin E (CuE), a tetracyclic triterpenoid isolated from Cucurbitaceae, possesses many pharmacological activities especially anti-cancer.                The aim of this investigation was to comprehensively assess CuE related hepatotoxicity and potential drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp).                Four common cytotoxicity assays (MTS, SRB, NRU and apoptosis assays) were used to evaluate the hepatotoxicity of CuE in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Human and rat liver microsomes incubation system, Caco-2 transport model and 3D organoids model were used to investigate the effects of CuE on CYP3A and P-gp in vitro. The oral pharmacokinetics of indinavir was employed to evaluate the effects of CuE on CYP3A and P-gp in vivo.                CuE induced the HepG2 apoptosis and exhibited acute cytotoxicity in MTS, SRB, and NRU assays with IC50 value at 15.98µM, 0.31µM, and 1.11µM, respectively. Moreover, CuE not only presented mechanism-based inhibition on human CYP3A4, but also decreased the efflux ratio of digoxin (P-gp substrate) across Caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro. Furthermore, CuE significantly inhibited the transport of Rh123 into 3D organoids, which was caused by the inhibition on P-gp. In Sprague-Dawley rat studies in vivo, acute administration of CuE significantly increased the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of indinavir. In contrast, CuE treatment for three consecutive days significantly decreased indinavir Cmax and AUC in rats.                These studies demonstrated that CuE has strong hepatotoxicity, and CuE presents potent inhibition on both CYP3A and P-gp activities in vitro. In animal in vivo studies, CuE induces CYP3A and P-gp after a long-term treatment but inhibits the activities of CYP3A and P-gp after an acute dosing. Therefore, CuE as a dual functional regulator of both CYP3A and P-gp may cause complex drug-drug interactions.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	
32466284        	Cell Theranostics on Mesoporous Silicon Substrates.            	The adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells over nanomaterials is regulated by a cascade of biochemical signals that originate at the interface of a cell with a substrate and propagate through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The topography of the substrate plays a major role in this process. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) have a characteristic size of some nanometers and a range of action of some tens of nanometers. Controlling details of a surface at the nanoscale-the same dimensional over which CAMs operate-offers ways to govern the behavior of cells and create organoids or tissues with heretofore unattainable precision. Here, using electrochemical procedures, we generated mesoporous silicon surfaces with different values of pore size (PS≈11 nm and PS≈21 nm), roughness (Ra≈7 nm and Ra≈13 nm), and fractal dimension (Df≈2.48 and Df≈2.15). Using electroless deposition, we deposited over these substrates thin layers of gold nanoparticles. Resulting devices feature (i) nanoscale details for the stimulation and control of cell assembly, (ii) arrays of pores for drug loading/release, (iii) layers of nanostructured gold for the enhancement of the electromagnetic signal in Raman spectroscopy (SERS). We then used these devices as cell culturing substrates. Upon loading with the anti-tumor drug PtCl (O,O'-acac)(DMSO) we examined the rate of adhesion and growth of breast cancer MCF-7 cells under the coincidental effects of surface geometry and drug release. Using confocal imaging and SERS spectroscopy we determined the relative importance of nano-topography and delivery of therapeutics on cell growth-and how an unbalance between these competing agents can accelerate the development of tumor cells.	
23955600        	Integrative genetic, epigenetic and pathological analysis of paraganglioma reveals complex dysregulation of NOTCH signaling.            	Head and neck paragangliomas, rare neoplasms of the paraganglia composed of nests of neurosecretory and glial cells embedded in vascular stroma, provide a remarkable example of organoid tumor architecture. To identify genes and pathways commonly deregulated in head and neck paraganglioma, we integrated high-density genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) analysis with microRNA and immunomorphological studies. Gene-centric CNV analysis of 24 cases identified a list of 104 genes most significantly targeted by tumor-associated alterations. The "NOTCH signaling pathway" was the most significantly enriched term in the list (P = 0.002 after Bonferroni or Benjamini correction). Expression of the relevant NOTCH pathway proteins in sustentacular (glial), chief (neuroendocrine) and endothelial cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in 47 head and neck paraganglioma cases. There were no relationships between level and pattern of NOTCH1/JAG2 protein expression and germline mutation status in the SDH genes, implicated in paraganglioma predisposition, or the presence/absence of immunostaining for SDHB, a surrogate marker of SDH mutations. Interestingly, NOTCH upregulation was observed also in cases with no evidence of CNVs at NOTCH signaling genes, suggesting altered epigenetic modulation of this pathway. To address this issue we performed microarray-based microRNA expression analyses. Notably 5 microRNAs (miR-200a,b,c and miR-34b,c), including those most downregulated in the tumors, correlated to NOTCH signaling and directly targeted NOTCH1 in in vitro experiments using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, lentiviral transduction of miR-200s and miR-34s in patient-derived primary tympano-jugular paraganglioma cell cultures was associated with NOTCH1 downregulation and increased levels of markers of cell toxicity and cell death. Taken together, our results provide an integrated view of common molecular alterations associated with head and neck paraganglioma and reveal an essential role of NOTCH pathway deregulation in this tumor type.

32160537        	Detection of Marker-Free Precision Genome Editing and Genetic Variation through the Capture of Genomic Signatures.            	Genome editing technologies have transformed our ability to engineer desired genomic changes within living systems. However, detecting precise genomic modifications often requires sophisticated, expensive, and time-consuming experimental approaches. Here, we describe DTECT (Dinucleotide signaTurE CapTure), a rapid and versatile detection method that relies on the capture of targeted dinucleotide signatures resulting from the digestion of genomic DNA amplicons by the type IIS restriction enzyme AcuI. DTECT enables the accurate quantification of marker-free precision genome editing events introduced by CRISPR-dependent homology-directed repair, base editing, or prime editing in various biological systems, such as mammalian cell lines, organoids, and tissues. Furthermore, DTECT allows the identification of oncogenic mutations in cancer mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and human cancer patient samples. The ease, speed, and cost efficiency by which DTECT identifies genomic signatures should facilitate the generation of marker-free cellular and animal models of human disease and expedite the detection of human pathogenic variants.

31978106        	The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins antagonist Debio 1143 promotes the PD-1 blockade-mediated HIV load reduction in blood and tissues of humanized mice.            	The immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) plays a major role in T cell exhaustion in cancer and chronic HIV infection. The inhibitor of apoptosis protein antagonist Debio 1143 (D1143) enhances tumor cell death and synergizes with anti-PD-1 agents to promote tumor immunity and displayed HIV latency reversal activity in vitro. We asked in this study whether D1143 would stimulate the potency of an anti-human PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to reduce HIV loads in humanized mice. Anti-PD-1 mAb treatment decreased PD-1+ CD8+ cell population by 32.3% after interruption of four weeks treatment, and D1143 co-treatment further reduced it from 32.3 to 73%. Anti-PD-1 mAb administration reduced HIV load in blood by 94%, and addition of D1143 further enhanced this reduction from 94 to 97%. D1143 also more profoundly promoted with the anti-PD-1-mediated reduction of HIV loads in all tissues analyzed including spleen (71 to 96.4%), lymph nodes (64.3 to 80%), liver (64.2 to 94.4), lung (64.3 to 80.1%) and thymic organoid (78.2 to 98.2%), achieving a >5 log reduction of HIV loads in CD4+ cells isolated from tissues 2 weeks after drug treatment interruption. Ex vivo anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation increased the ability to activate exhausted CD8+ T cells in infected mice having received in vivo anti-PD-1 treatment by 7.9-fold (5 to 39.6%), and an additional increase by 1.7-fold upon D1143 co-treatment (39.6 to 67.3%). These findings demonstrate for the first time that an inhibitor of apoptosis protein antagonist enhances in a statistically manner the effects of an immune check point inhibitor on antiviral immunity and on HIV load reduction in tissues of humanized mice, suggesting that the combination of two distinct classes of immunomodulatory agents constitutes a promising anti-HIV immunotherapeutic approach.	
26365194        	Sox10 Regulates Stem/Progenitor and Mesenchymal Cell States in Mammary Epithelial Cells.            	To discover mechanisms that mediate plasticity in mammary cells, we characterized signaling networks that are present in the mammary stem cells responsible for fetal and adult mammary development. These analyses identified a signaling axis between FGF signaling and the transcription factor Sox10. Here, we show that Sox10 is specifically expressed in mammary cells exhibiting the highest levels of stem/progenitor activity. This includes fetal and adult mammary cells in vivo and mammary organoids in vitro. Sox10 is functionally relevant, as its deletion reduces stem/progenitor competence whereas its overexpression increases stem/progenitor activity. Intriguingly, we also show that Sox10 overexpression causes mammary cells to undergo a mesenchymal transition. Consistent with these findings, Sox10 is preferentially expressed in stem- and mesenchymal-like breast cancers. These results demonstrate a signaling mechanism through which stem and mesenchymal states are acquired in mammary cells and suggest therapeutic avenues in breast cancers for which targeted therapies are currently unavailable.

32414908        	Antitumor Activity of Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372), an EGFR-MET Bispecific Antibody, in Diverse Models of EGFR Exon 20 Insertion-Driven NSCLC.            	EGFR exon 20 insertion driver mutations (Exon20ins) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are insensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372), a bispecific antibody targeting EGFR-MET, has shown preclinical activity in TKI-sensitive EGFR-mutated NSCLC models and in an ongoing first-in-human study in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, the activity of amivantamab in Exon20ins-driven tumors has not yet been described. Ba/F3 cells and patient-derived cells/organoids/xenograft models harboring diverse Exon20ins were used to characterize the antitumor mechanism of amivantamab. Amivantamab inhibited proliferation by effectively downmodulating EGFR-MET levels and inducing immune-directed antitumor activity with increased IFNγ secretion in various models. Importantly, in vivo efficacy of amivantamab was superior to cetuximab or poziotinib, an experimental Exon20ins-targeted TKI. Amivantamab produced robust tumor responses in two Exon20ins patients, highlighting the important translational nature of this preclinical work. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the activity of amivantamab and support its continued clinical development in Exon20ins patients, an area of high unmet medical need. SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, there are no approved targeted therapies for EGFR Exon20ins-driven NSCLC. Preclinical data shown here, together with promising clinical activity in an ongoing phase I study, strongly support further clinical investigation of amivantamab in EGFR Exon20ins-driven NSCLC.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1079.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
29801529        	Recapitulating and Deciphering Human Pancreas Development From Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in a Dish.            	Here, we review how human pluripotent stem cell models of pancreas development have emerged and became an important tool to study human development and disease. Initially developed toward the production of β cells for diabetes therapy, the protocols have been refined based on knowledge of pancreas development in model organisms. While the cells produced are closer and closer to the end goal of a functional β cell, these models have also been used to carry out functional experiments addressing gene function and expression as well as regulatory and epigenetic landscape changes during human pancreas development. They thereby complement model organisms and reports from human genetic variants predisposing to different forms of diabetes, as well as observations on human fetal tissue. In this review, we therefore compare these different sources of information and discuss how human stem cell models are evolving to inform us on pancreatic diseases and possible treatments.                © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

29290997        	Targeting G-protein coupled receptor-related signaling pathway in a murine xenograft model of appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei.            	Cancer cells aberrantly express mucins to enhance their survival. Relative chemoresistance of appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is attributed to abundant extracellular mucin 2 (MUC2) protein production. We hypothesized that simultaneous MUC2 inhibition and apoptosis induction would be effective against mucinous tumors. In vitro studies were conducted using LS174T cells (MUC2-secreting human colorectal cancer cells), PMP explant tissue, and epithelial organoid cultures (colonoids) derived from mucinous appendix cancers. In vivo studies were conducted using murine intraperitoneal patient-derived xenograft model of PMP. We found COX-2 over-expression in PMP explant tissue, which is known to activate G-protein coupled EP4/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. MUC2 expression was reduced in vitro by small molecule inhibitors targeting EP4/PKA/CREB molecules and celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor), and this was mediated by reduced CREB transcription factor binding to the MUC2 promoter. While celecoxib (5-40 µM) reduced MUC2 expression in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion, only high-dose celecoxib (≥ 20 µM) decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis. Chronic oral administration of celecoxib decreased mucinous tumor growth in our in vivo PMP model via a combination of MUC2 inhibition and induction of apoptosis. We provide a preclinical rationale for using drugs that simultaneously inhibit MUC2 production and induce apoptosis to treat patients with PMP.	
33654739        	In vitro Self-organized Mouse Small Intestinal Epithelial Monolayer Protocol.            	Developing protocols to obtain intestinal epithelial monolayers that recapitulate in vivo physiology to overcome the limitations of the organoids' closed geometry has become of great interest during the last few years. Most of the developed culture models showed physiological-relevant cell composition but did not prove self-renewing capacities. Here, we show a simple method to obtain mouse small intestine-derived epithelial monolayers organized into proliferative crypt-like domains, containing stem cells, and differentiated villus-like regions, closely resembling the in vivo cell composition and distribution. In addition, we adapted our model to a tissue culture format compatible with functional studies and prove close to physiological barrier properties of our in vitro epithelial monolayers. Thus, we have set-up a protocol to generate physiologically relevant intestinal epithelial monolayers to be employed in assays where independent access to both luminal and basolateral compartments is needed, such as drug absorption, intracellular trafficking and microbiome-epithelium interaction assays.

31028651        	Single-Cell Live Imaging.            	Recent fluorescence microscopy allows for high-throughput acquisition of 5D (X, Y, Z, T, and Color) images in various targets such as cultured cells, 3D spheroid/organoid, and even living tissue with single-cell resolution. The technology is considered promising to augment insights on heterogeneous features of both physiological and pathological cell phenotypes, for instance, distinct responses of cancer cells to anticancer drug treatment. Here we overview microscopic applications to capture live cell events for different types of targets, together with a couple of proof of concepts. The 2D live imaging will be exemplified by a FRET-based time-lapse cultured cell imaging, and 3D tissue imaging protocol will be complemented with a method for mouse skin live imaging.	
33051807        	Cellular model systems to study cardiovascular injury from chemotherapy.            	In spite of all the efforts for generating efficient pharmacological treatment options for cancer patients, the unwanted side effect of these substances on the cardiovascular system is becoming a major issue for cancer survivors. The fast pacing oncology field necessitate the quest for more accurate and reliable preclinical screenings. hiPSCs derived cardiomyocytes, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells provide unlimited source of physiologically relevant cells that could be used in the screening platforms. Cells derived from hiPSCs can measure drug induced alterations to different aspect of the heart including electrophysiology, contractility and structure. In this review, we will give an overview of the different in vivo and in vitro preclinical drug safety screenings. In following sections, we will focus on hiPSCs derived cardiomyocytes, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and present the current knowledge of the application of these cells in unicellular cardiotoxicity assays. In the final part, we will focus on cardiac organoids as multi cell type platform and their role in cardiotoxicity screening of the chemotherapeutic drugs.

The mitochondrial Nod-like receptor protein NLRX1 protects against colorectal tumorigenesis through mechanisms that remain unclear.

These Nlrx1 mutant mice have increased expression of Tnf, Egf, and Tgfb1, three factors essential for wound healing, as well as increased epithelial proliferation during the epithelial regeneration phase following injury triggered by dextran sodium sulfate. In primary intestinal organoids lacking Nlrx1, stimulation with TNF resulted in exacerbated proliferation and expression of the intestinal stem cell markers Olfm4 and Myb. This hyper-proliferation response was associated with increased activation of Akt and NF-κB pathways in response to TNF stimulation. Together, these results identify NLRX1 as a suppressor of colonic tumorigenesis that acts by controlling epithelial proliferation in the intestine during the regeneration phase following mucosal injury.

30581312        	Just another metastatic carcinoid tumour to the uveal tract.            	We describe the clinic, image, and histopathologic features of a well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (carcinoid tumour) metastatic to choroid and ciliary body in a 52-year-old Mexican Mestizo man. The ophthalmologic examination showed an inferior choroidal mass accompanied by exudative retinal detachment. Ultrasound B-Scan study revealed a diffuse thickened choroid with overlying serous retinal detachment, ultrasound A-Scan revealed a high internal reflectivity solid lesion. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) evidenced a dome shaped ciliary body mass, presumptive diagnosis was uveal tract metastatic disease. Scleral flap choroidal incisional biopsy was performed. Microscopic evaluation demonstrated a hypercellular lesion replacing choroid, composed by cohesive oval-round cells with finely granular chromatin arranged in organoid pattern. Immunohistochemical reactions were Pankeratin AE1/AE3 (+), Cytokeratin CK5/6 (+), Chromogranin A (+), Ki67 (20%), typical well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (carcinoid tumour) was diagnosed. Patient had a mediastinal carcinoid diagnosed 3 years earlier. Metastatic cancer to the eye is perhaps the leading cause of intraocular tumour, despite this fact metastases are rarely seen by the ophthalmologist while the patient is alive. Intraocular metastasis should be considered in the presence of ciliary body or/and choroidal amelanotic or pigmented mass and serous retinal detachment in a patient with history of carcinoid tumor, althought its low frequency (2.2%).	
25885142        	Mullerian choristoma in a case of spinal dysraphism.            	It is extremely rare to find mullerian choristomas in association with spinal dysraphism, with <10 cases published in English literature. We report a case of heterotopic uterus and fallopian tube-like tissue within a lumbar subcutaneous lipoma associated with spina bifida and tethered cord. A 21-year-old lady presented with lumbar swelling since birth and dull pain in the lower back. Magnetic resonance imaging showed spina bifida at level L3 and L4, tethering of the cord and a subcutaneous lipomatous swelling. Biopsy revealed lobules of fibroadipose tissue embedded in which were seen organoid cystic structures containing prominent smooth muscle coats in their wall. These cystic structures were lined by the endometrium and showed fallopian tube-like papillary infoldings. Immunohistochemistry showed estrogen receptor positivity in the epithelium, stroma, and smooth muscles. The epithelial cells were also positive for cancer antigen 125 and cytokeratin 7 while the stromal cells showed CD10 positivity, supporting mullerian derivation. The pathogenesis and differential diagnosis of such lesions is discussed.	
30374202        	Biomaterials and engineered microenvironments to control YAP/TAZ-dependent cell behaviour.            	Mechanical signals are increasingly recognized as overarching regulators of cell behaviour, controlling stemness, organoid biology, tissue development and regeneration. Moreover, aberrant mechanotransduction is a driver of disease, including cancer, fibrosis and cardiovascular defects. A central question remains how cells compute a host of biomechanical signals into meaningful biological behaviours. Biomaterials and microfabrication technologies are essential to address this issue. Here we review a large body of evidence that connects diverse biomaterial-based systems to the functions of YAP/TAZ, two highly related mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators. YAP/TAZ orchestrate the response to a suite of engineered microenviroments, emerging as a universal control system for cells in two and three dimensions, in static or dynamic fashions, over a range of elastic and viscoelastic stimuli, from solid to fluid states. This approach may guide the rational design of technological and material-based platforms with dramatically improved functionalities and inform the generation of new biomaterials for regenerative medicine applications.	
24341474        	Naevus sebaceus: a mosaic RASopathy.            	Epidermal naevi are common cutaneous mosaic disorders that occur in 0.1-0.3% of live births. They are subdivided into keratinocytic and organoid naevi, the latter including naevus sebaceus (NS). Typically, NS develops as a yellowish-orange plaque on the scalp, and represents a hamartoma containing epidermal, sebaceous and apocrine elements. The histological features of NS sampled in childhood include hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, increased sebaceous lobules, and primitive hair follicles. During puberty, most lesions develop more prominent sebaceous and apocrine components. Subsequently, secondary tumours may occur in around 25% of NS; most lesions are benign (e.g. trichoblastomas, syringocystadenoma papilliferum or other basaloid proliferations), although malignant tumours arising within NS can occur (< 1%). Recently, somatic mosaicism has been shown, with activating Ras mutations in HRAS or KRAS in NS lesional keratinocytes (but not in adjacent nonlesional skin or dermal fibroblasts). These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signalling pathways, and result in increased cellular proliferation. Similar but more extensive mosaicism underlies Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome. The most common mutation is c.37G>C (p.Gly13Arg) in HRAS, which is present in > 90% of NS. This mutation also seems to be present in NS cases that develop secondary tumours, although no additional mutations (second hit) or other genetic events have yet been identified. Treatment of NS often involves prophylactic surgical excision, but the recent identification of key epidermal signalling abnormalities underlying the cell proliferation means that future development of new medical treatments for NS that target the aberrant signalling pathways may also be feasible.                © 2013 British Association of Dermatologists.	
33424939        	Review: In vitro Cell Platform for Understanding Developmental Toxicity.            	Developmental toxicity and its affiliation to long-term health, particularly neurodegenerative disease (ND) has attracted significant attentions in recent years. There is, however, a significant gap in current models to track longitudinal changes arising from developmental toxicity. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neuronal culture has allowed for more complex and functionally active in vitro neuronal models. Coupled with recent progress in the detection of ND biomarkers, we are equipped with promising new tools to understand neurotoxicity arising from developmental exposure. This review provides a brief overview of current progress in neuronal culture derived from iPSC and in ND markers.                Copyright © 2020 Xie, Wettschurack and Yuan.	
31448179        	Buckling without Bending: A New Paradigm in Morphogenesis.            	A curious feature of organ and organoid morphogenesis is that in certain cases, spatial oscillations in the thickness of the growing "film" are out of phase with the deformation of the slower-growing "substrate," while in other cases, the oscillations are in phase. The former cannot be explained by elastic bilayer instability, and contradict the notion that there is a universal mechanism by which brains, intestines, teeth, and other organs develop surface wrinkles and folds. Inspired by the microstructure of the embryonic cerebellum, we develop a new model of 2D morphogenesis in which system-spanning elastic fibers endow the organ with a preferred radius, while a separate fiber network resides in the otherwise fluidlike film at the outer edge of the organ and resists thickness gradients thereof. The tendency of the film to uniformly thicken or thin is described via a "growth potential." Several features of cerebellum, +blebbistatin organoid, and retinal fovea morphogenesis, including out-of-phase behavior and a film thickness amplitude that is comparable to the radius amplitude, are readily explained by our simple analytical model, as may be an observed scale invariance in the number of folds in the cerebellum. We also study a nonlinear variant of the model, propose further biological and bioinspired applications, and address how our model is and is not unique to the developing nervous system.	
23121031        	Perineural cell differentiation in ganglioneuromas.  Report of 8 cases with immunohistochemical  expression of perineural cell markers.            	Eight cases of ganglioneuroma were examined for a presence of perineural cell differentiation, using the immunohistochemical markers epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), claudin-1 and GLUT-1. The mean age of the patients was 42.3 years (range 26-68 years), six patients were females and two were males. Five tumors were located in the adrenal gland and 3 tumors in the retroperitoneum. Morphology of the tumors was typical, i.e., they were composed of neuroid spindle cell population and scattered mature appearing ganglion cells. Spindle cells positive for perineural cell markers claudin-1 and GLUT-1 were found in all lesions, at least focally. EMA+ cells were seen in 2 of 8 tumors. These perineural-type cells were often arranged in organoid fashion around the schwannoid bundles or around the vessels. Our findings indicate that perineural cell differentiation is commonly present in ganglioneuromas.	
22699864        	Ileostomy-associated chronic papillomatous dermatitis showing nevus sebaceous-like hyperplasia, HPV 16 infection, and lymphedema: a case report and literature review of ostomy-associated reactive epidermal hyperplasias.            	Chronic papillomatous dermatitis (CPD) is a stoma site complication due to chronic irritant contact dermatitis. Papillomatosis can also arise in the setting of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or chronic lymphedema (elephantiasis). Herein, we report the case of a 57-year-old female who presented with a papillomatous growth surrounding a loop ileostomy suspected to be recurrent ovarian serous carcinoma. Excisional biopsy demonstrated nevus sebaceous (NS)-like organoid hyperplasia with koilocytes overlying a dermal scar that exhibited lymphangiectases. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing for HPV DNA detected HPV 16. In situ hybridization for high-risk HPV DNA showed punctate nuclear pattern in the keratinocytes populating the NS-like hyperplasia indicating integrated HPV 16 DNA. No recurrence has been observed 11 months postexcision. Reports of CPD have documented a spectrum of reactive epidermal hyperplasias including pseudoepitheliomatous, verrucous, papillomatous, syringofibroadenomatous, and rudimentary follicular hyperplasias. HPV DNA has been detected in 3 of 4 CDP cases tested to date and in authentic NS. We postulate that localized lymphedema secondary to scarring coupled with chronic epidermal irritation and inflammation allowed for latent HPV infection to manifest as CPD with NS-like cutaneous hyperplasia.	
33322698        	CDKN2A-Inactivated Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Exhibits Therapeutic Sensitivity to Paclitaxel: A Bioinformatics Study.            	The mutation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) is frequently found in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, its prognostic and therapeutic roles in PDAC have not been extensively investigated yet. In this study, we mined and integrated the cancer genomics and chemogenomics data to investigate the roles of CDKN2A genetic alterations in PDAC patients' prognosis and treatment. We found that functional CDKN2A inactivation caused by mutations and deep deletions predicted poor prognosis in PDAC patients. CDKN2A inactivation was associated with the upregulation of genes related to estrogen response, which can be overcome by CDKN2A restoration. Chemosensitivity profiling of PDAC cell lines and patient-derived organoids found that CDKN2A inactivation was associated with the increased sensitivity to paclitaxel and SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan). However, only paclitaxel can mimic the effect of CDKN2A restoration, and its drug sensitivity was correlated with genes related to estrogen response. Therefore, our study suggested that CDKN2A-inactivated PDAC patients could benefit from the precision treatment with paclitaxel, whose albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel) has been approved for treating PDAC.	
30030360        	Clinical syndromes associated with mtDNA mutations: where we stand after 30 years.            	The landmark year 1988 can be considered as the birthdate of mitochondrial medicine, when the first pathogenic mutations affecting mtDNA were associated with human diseases. Three decades later, the field still expands and we are not 'scraping the bottom of the barrel' yet. Despite the tremendous progress in terms of molecular characterization and genotype/phenotype correlations, for the vast majority of cases we still lack a deep understanding of the pathogenesis, good models to study, and effective therapeutic options. However, recent technological advances including somatic cell reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), organoid technology, and tailored endonucleases provide unprecedented opportunities to fill these gaps, casting hope to soon cure the major primary mitochondrial phenotypes reviewed here. This group of rare diseases represents a key model for tackling the pathogenic mechanisms involving mitochondrial biology relevant to much more common disorders that affect our currently ageing population, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders, and cancer.                © 2018 The Author(s).

28734180        	Bottom-up assembly of salivary gland microtissues for assessing myoepithelial cell function.            	Myoepithelial cells are flat, stellate cells present in exocrine tissues including the salivary glands. While myoepithelial cells have been studied extensively in mammary and lacrimal gland tissues, less is known of the function of myoepithelial cells derived from human salivary glands. Several groups have isolated tumorigenic myoepithelial cells from cancer specimens, however, only one report has demonstrated isolation of normal human salivary myoepithelial cells needed for use in salivary gland tissue engineering applications. Establishing a functional organoid model consisting of myoepithelial and secretory acinar cells is therefore necessary for understanding the coordinated action of these two cell types in unidirectional fluid secretion. Here, we developed a bottom-up approach for generating salivary gland microtissues using primary human salivary myoepithelial cells (hSMECs) and stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) isolated from normal salivary gland tissues. Phenotypic characterization of isolated hSMECs confirmed that a myoepithelial cell phenotype consistent with that from other exocrine tissues was maintained over multiple passages of culture. Additionally, hSMECs secreted basement membrane proteins, expressed adrenergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter receptors, and released intracellular calcium [Ca2+i] in response to parasympathetic agonists. In a collagen I contractility assay, activation of contractile machinery was observed in isolated hSMECs treated with parasympathetic agonists. Recombination of hSMECs with assembled hS/PC spheroids in a microwell system was used to create microtissues resembling secretory complexes of the salivary gland. We conclude that the engineered salivary gland microtissue complexes provide a physiologically relevant model for both mechanistic studies and as a building block for the successful engineering of the salivary gland for restoration of salivary function in patients suffering from hyposalivation.

32648727        	Growing Human Dermal Fibroblasts as Spheroids Renders Them Susceptible for Early Expression of Pluripotency Genes.            	Suspension spheroid cultures of anchorage-dependent cell types have been widely used in cancer and stem cell research, as well as for producing organoids. It is believed that the 3-dimensional spheroid presents cells with a more physiological microenvironment to grow so that they behave more like cells in vivo, which is lacking in conventional 2-dimensional monolayer cultures. Recently, it has been reported that cancer cells grown as spheroids could express stem cell-associated genes. Hence, it is investigated whether normal mouse and human fibroblasts cultured as spheroids could also be induced to express stem cell-associated genes. The transcriptomes of human fibroblasts cultured as a monolayer and spheroids are compared and analyzed using real-time RT-qPCR, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatics. The results reveal that the spheroid transcriptome resemble somatic cells being reprogramed into stem cells, including the induced expression of stemness-associated genes, increased expression of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition-associated genes, and decreased expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-associated genes. In this context, it is hypothesized that during the process of spheroid formation, matrix-cell signaling is lost in favor of cell-cell contact signaling and that this subsequently increases the activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway that then upregulates Tbdx3 and stemness-associated genes.                © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

32423529        	CytoCensus, mapping cell identity and division in tissues and organs using machine learning.            	A major challenge in cell and developmental biology is the automated identification and quantitation of cells in complex multilayered tissues. We developed CytoCensus: an easily deployed implementation of supervised machine learning that extends convenient 2D 'point-and-click' user training to 3D detection of cells in challenging datasets with ill-defined cell boundaries. In tests on such datasets, CytoCensus outperforms other freely available image analysis software in accuracy and speed of cell detection. We used CytoCensus to count stem cells and their progeny, and to quantify individual cell divisions from time-lapse movies of explanted Drosophila larval brains, comparing wild-type and mutant phenotypes. We further illustrate the general utility and future potential of CytoCensus by analysing the 3D organisation of multiple cell classes in Zebrafish retinal organoids and cell distributions in mouse embryos. CytoCensus opens the possibility of straightforward and robust automated analysis of developmental phenotypes in complex tissues.                © 2020, Hailstone et al.	
32669378        	Evidencing a Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Subpopulation Sensitive to the Proteasome Inhibitor Carfilzomib.            	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer with a survival rate less than 5%. Multiple chemotherapeutic drugs have been tested to improve patient prognosis; however, the clinical efficacy of these treatments is low. One of the most controversial family of drugs are the proteasome inhibitors, which have displayed promising effects in preclinical studies, but low clinical performance. Here, we unravel a specific transcriptomic signature that discriminates a subgroup of patients sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib.                First, we identified a subpopulation of PDAC-derived primary cells cultures (PDPCC) sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib. Then, we selected a transcriptomic signature that predicts carfilzomib chemosensitivity using independent component analysis on the transcriptome of PDPCC. Finally, we validated the signature in an independent cohort of PDAC biopsy-derived pancreatic organoids.                Sensitive phenotype was characterized by a high expression of genes related with a cornified/squamous pathway and a downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes. Interestingly, carfilzomib-sensitive transcriptomic profile did not show any association with the proteasome activity but strongly correlates with ATF4 and CHOP expression, which are key markers of the unfolded protein response and critical to trigger the cell death program. Concordantly, sensitive phenotype showed a high level of the de novo RNA and protein synthesis compared with the resistant one and, most important, cell death induced by carfilzomib is dependent of the translational activity.                We demonstrate the existence of a carfilzomib-sensitive PDAC subgroup with a specific transcriptomic phenotype that could explain the biological reason for this responsiveness.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.

29531554        	A Carcinoid Tumor in the Urinary Bladder with Uncommon Clinicopathological Presentation.            	Carcinoid tumors usually originate from the enterochromaffin cells located in gastrointestinal tract and bronchopulmonary system. They may rarely arise in the urinary bladder, where this can be eventually miscued as any other commoner bladder neoplasms. The current study was conducted to connote an uncommon clinicopathological presentation by a carcinoid tumor in the urinary bladder.                A 52-year-old male, who initially experienced obstructive urinary symptoms, underwent cystourethroscopy to remove a tumor in the urinary bladder. The tumor exhibited insular, trabecular, and organoid architecture on histology without any necrosis or mitosis, stained positively with chromogranin A, and thereby, confirmed the diagnosis of a pure carcinoid tumor.                Carcinoid tumors rarely arise in the urinary bladder and other genitourinary organs. But, several other and relatively more common bladder neoplasms may often deceptively simulate it. This dilemma could be resolved easily with the application of proper immunohistochemistry (IHC) in neuroendocrine tumors.	
33630828        	The protein phosphatase PPM1A dephosphorylates and activates YAP to govern mammalian intestinal and liver regeneration.            	The Hippo-YAP pathway responds to diverse environmental cues to manage tissue homeostasis, organ regeneration, tumorigenesis, and immunity. However, how phosphatase(s) directly target Yes-associated protein (YAP) and determine its physiological activity are still inconclusive. Here, we utilized an unbiased phosphatome screening and identified protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A/PP2Cα) as the bona fide and physiological YAP phosphatase. We found that PPM1A was associated with YAP/TAZ in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to directly eliminate phospho-S127 on YAP, which conferring YAP the nuclear distribution and transcription potency. Accordingly, genetic ablation or depletion of PPM1A in cells, organoids, and mice elicited an enhanced YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic retention and resulted in the diminished cell proliferation, severe gut regeneration defects in colitis, and impeded liver regeneration upon injury. These regeneration defects in murine model were largely rescued via a genetic large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) deficiency or the pharmacological inhibition of Hippo-YAP signaling. Therefore, we identify a physiological phosphatase of YAP/TAZ, describe its critical effects in YAP/TAZ cellular distribution, and demonstrate its physiological roles in mammalian organ regeneration.	
32699013        	Phase separation drives decision making in cell division.            	Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biomolecules drives the formation of subcellular compartments with distinct physicochemical properties. These compartments, free of lipid bilayers and therefore called membraneless organelles, include nucleoli, centrosomes, heterochromatin, and centromeres. These have emerged as a new paradigm to account for subcellular organization and cell fate decisions. Here we summarize recent studies linking LLPS to mitotic spindle, heterochromatin, and centromere assembly and their plasticity controls in the context of the cell division cycle, highlighting a functional role for phase behavior and material properties of proteins assembled onto heterochromatin, centromeres, and central spindles via LLPS. The techniques and tools for visualizing and harnessing membraneless organelle dynamics and plasticity in mitosis are also discussed, as is the potential for these discoveries to promote new research directions for investigating chromosome dynamics, plasticity, and interchromosome interactions in the decision-making process during mitosis.                © 2020 Liu et al.	
32967973        	Therapeutic targeting of KSP in preclinical models of high-risk neuroblastoma.            	Neuroblastoma is a childhood malignancy with often dismal prognosis; relapse is common despite intense treatment. Here, we used human tumor organoids representing multiple MYCN-amplified high-risk neuroblastomas to perform a high-throughput drug screen with approved or emerging oncology drugs. Tumor-selective effects were calculated using drug sensitivity scores. Several drugs with previously unreported anti-neuroblastoma effects were identified by stringent selection criteria. ARRY-520, an inhibitor of kinesin spindle protein (KSP), was among those causing reduced viability. High expression of the KSP-encoding gene KIF11 was associated with poor outcome in neuroblastoma. Genome-scale loss-of-function screens in hundreds of human cancer cell lines across 22 tumor types revealed that KIF11 is particularly important for neuroblastoma cell viability. KSP inhibition in neuroblastoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells resulted in the formation of abnormal monoastral spindles, mitotic arrest, up-regulation of mitosis-associated genes, and apoptosis. In vivo, KSP inhibition caused regression of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma PDX tumors. Furthermore, treatment of mice harboring orthotopic neuroblastoma PDX tumors resulted in increased survival. Our results suggested that KSP inhibition could be a promising treatment strategy in children with high-risk neuroblastoma.

33638871        	Pouring petrol on the flames: using oncolytic virotherapies to enhance tumour immunogenicity.            	Oncolytic viruses possess the ability to infect, replicate and lyse malignantly transformed tumour cells. This oncolytic activity amplifies the therapeutic advantage and induces a form of immunogenic cell death, characterised by increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumour microenvironment. This important feature of oncolytic viruses can result in the warming up of immunologically "cold" tumour types, presenting the enticing possibility that oncolytic virus treatment combined with immunotherapies may enhance efficacy. In this review, we assess some of the most promising candidates that might be used for oncolytic virotherapy: immunotherapy combinations. We assess their potential as separate agents or as agents combined into a single therapy, where the immunotherapy is encoded within the genome of the oncolytic virus. The development of such advanced agents will require increasingly sophisticated model systems for their preclinical assessment and evaluation. In vivo rodent model systems are fraught with limitations in this regard. Oncolytic viruses replicate selectively within human cells, and therefore require human xenografts in immune-deficient mice for their evaluation. However, the use of immune-deficient rodent models hinders the ability to study immune responses against any immunomodulatory transgenes engineered within the viral genome and expressed within the tumour microenvironment. There has therefore been a shift towards the use of more sophisticated ex vivo, patient derived model systems based on organoids and explant co-cultures with immune cells, which may be more predictive of efficacy than contrived and artificial animal models. We review the best of those model systems here.                This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	
33554073        	Inhibitor of Differentiation 4 (ID4) represses mammary myoepithelial differentiation via inhibition of HEB.            	Inhibitor of differentiation (ID) proteins dimerize with basic HLH (bHLH) transcription factors, repressing transcription of lineage-specification genes across diverse cellular lineages. ID4 is a key regulator of mammary stem cells; however, the mechanism by which it achieves this is unclear. Here, we show that ID4 has a cell autonomous role in preventing myoepithelial differentiation of basal cells in mammary organoids and in vivo. ID4 positively regulates proliferative genes and negatively regulates genes involved in myoepithelial function. Mass spectrometry reveals that ID4 interacts with the bHLH protein HEB, which binds to E-box motifs in regulatory elements of basal developmental genes involved in extracellular matrix and the contractile cytoskeleton. We conclude that high ID4 expression in mammary basal stem cells antagonizes HEB transcriptional activity, preventing myoepithelial differentiation and allowing for appropriate tissue morphogenesis. Downregulation of ID4 during pregnancy modulates gene regulated by HEB, promoting specialization of basal cells into myoepithelial cells.                © 2021 The Author(s).	
33495401        	Adaptor Protein ShcD/SHC4 Interacts with Tie2 Receptor to Synergistically Promote Glioma Cell Invasion.            	Gliomas are characterized by diffuse infiltration of tumor cells into surrounding brain tissue, and this highly invasive nature contributes to disease recurrence and poor patient outcomes. The molecular mechanisms underlying glioma cell invasion remain incompletely understood, limiting development of new targeted therapies. Here, we have identified phosphotyrosine adaptor protein ShcD as upregulated in malignant glioma and shown that it associates with receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 to facilitate invasion. In human glioma cells, we find that expression of ShcD and Tie2 increases invasion, and this significant synergistic effect is disrupted with a ShcD mutant that cannot bind Tie2 or hyperphosphorylate the receptor. Expression of ShcD and/or Tie2 further increases invadopodia formation and matrix degradation in U87 glioma cells. In a coculture model, we show that U87-derived tumor spheroids expressing both ShcD and Tie2 display enhanced infiltration into cerebral organoids. Mechanistically, we identify changes in focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation in the presence of ShcD and/or Tie2 in U87 cells upon Tie2 activation. Finally, we identify a strong correlation between transcript levels of ShcD and Tie2 signaling components as well as N-cadherin in advanced gliomas and those with classical or mesenchymal subtypes, and we show that elevated expression of ShcD correlates with a significant reduction in patient survival in higher grade gliomas with mesenchymal signature. Altogether, our data highlight a novel Tie2-ShcD signaling axis in glioma cell invasion, which may be of clinical significance. IMPLICATIONS: ShcD cooperates with Tie2 to promote glioma cell invasion and its elevated expression correlates with poor patient outcome in advanced gliomas.                ©2021 American Association for Cancer Research.	
33477674        	Advances in Research of Adult Gliomas.            	Diffuse gliomas are the most frequent brain tumours, representing 75% of all primary malignant brain tumours in adults. Because of their locally aggressive behaviour and the fact that they cannot be cured by current therapies, they represent one of the most devastating cancers. The present review summarises recent advances in our understanding of glioma development and progression by use of various in vitro and in vivo models, as well as more complex techniques including cultures of 3D organoids and organotypic slices. We discuss the progress that has been made in understanding glioma heterogeneity, alteration in gene expression and DNA methylation, as well as advances in various in silico models. Lastly current treatment options and future clinical trials, which aim to improve early diagnosis and disease monitoring, are also discussed.

23592797        	The hemopexin domain of MMP3 is responsible for mammary epithelial invasion and morphogenesis through extracellular interaction with HSP90β.            	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are crucial mediators in sculpting tissue architecture and are required for many physiological and pathological processes. MMP3 has been shown to regulate branching morphogenesis in the mammary gland. Ectopic expression of proteolytically active MMP3 in mouse mammary epithelia triggers supernumerary lateral branching and, eventually, tumors. Using a three-dimensional collagen-I (Col-1) gel assay that simulates epithelial invasion and branching, we show that it is the hemopexin domain that directs these processes. Using three different engineered constructs containing a variation on MMP3 structural domains, we confirmed the importance of the hemopexin domain also in primary organoids of the mammary gland. A proteomic screen of MMP3-binding partners surprisingly revealed that the intracellular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 β (HSP90β) is present extracellularly, and its interaction with the hemopexin domain of MMP3 is critical for invasion. Blocking of HSP90β with inhibitory antibodies added to the medium abolished invasion and branching. These findings shift the focus from the proteolytic activity of MMP3 as the central player to its hemopexin domain and add a new dimension to HSP90β's functions by revealing a hitherto undescribed mechanism of MMP3 regulation. Our data also may shed light on the failure of strategies to use MMP inhibitors in cancer treatment and other related disorders.	
32075691        	Recent advances in human stem cell-based modeling of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.            	Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by epilepsy, intellectual disability, and benign tumors of the brain, heart, skin, and kidney. Animal models have contributed to our understanding of normal and abnormal human brain development, but the construction of models that accurately recapitulate a human pathology remains challenging. Recent advances in stem cell biology with the derivation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from somatic cells from patients have opened new avenues to the study of TSC. This approach combined with gene-editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 offers the advantage of preserving patient-specific genetic background and the ability to generate isogenic controls by correcting a specific mutation. The patient cell line and the isogenic control can be differentiated into the cell type of interest to model various aspects of TSC. In this review, we discuss the remarkable capacity of these cells to be used as a model for TSC in two- and three-dimensional cultures, the potential variability in iPSC models, and highlight differences between findings reported to date.	
22494537        	Plexiform hybrid granular cell tumor/perineurioma: a novel variant of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor with divergent differentiation.            	The descriptive term hybrid peripheral nerve sheath tumor refers to any neoplasm of the neurilemmal apparatus composed of more than one pathologically defined tumoral equivalent derived from its constituent cells. Within this uncommon nosological category, participation of granular cell tumor - a neoplasm of modified Schwann cells - has been reported only exceptionally. We describe a hitherto not documented variant composed of an organoid mixture of granular cell tumor and perineurioma with plexiform growth. A solitary subcutaneous nodule of 1.5 cm diameter was excised from the right ring finger of a 19-year-old female with no antecedents of neurofibromatosis or relevant trauma. Histology revealed a monotonous, yet cytologically dimorphic proliferation of classical granular cells intermingled with flattened, inconspicuous perineurial cells. Immunohistochemical double labeling detected expression of S100 protein in the former and of EMA and GLUT-1 in the latter. While the respective staining patterns for S100 protein and EMA or GLUT-1 tended to be mutually exclusive, a minority of cells exhibited transitional granular cell/perineurial immunophenotype. Electron microscopy permitted direct visualization of a plethora of lysosomes in the granular cell moiety, and of pinocytotic vesicles and tight junctions in perineurial cells. Intratumoral axons were not detected. Expanding intraneurally, the lesion showed discrete encapsulation by the local perineurium, and resulted in plexiform growth. The MIB-1 labeling index averaged 1%. We interpret our findings as supporting evidence for the dual cell lineage to have arisen through metaplasia, with the tumor's dynamics probably having been driven by the granular cell component.

27342214        	Deletion of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 From Mouse Intestine Causes Loss of Stem Cells.            	The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) regulates differentiation by contributing to repression of gene expression and thereby stabilizing the fate of stem cells and their progeny. PRC2 helps to maintain adult stem cell populations, but little is known about its functions in intestinal stem cells. We studied phenotypes of mice with intestine-specific deletion of the PRC2 proteins embryonic ectoderm development (EED) (a subunit required for PRC2 function) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) (a histone methyltransferase).                We performed studies of AhCre;EedLoxP/LoxP (EED knockout) mice and AhCre;Ezh2LoxP/LoxP (EZH2 knockout) mice, which have intestine-specific disruption in EED and EZH2, respectively. Small intestinal crypts were isolated and subsequently cultured to grow organoids. Intestines and organoids were analyzed by immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, RNA sequence, and chromatin immunoprecipitation methods.                Intestines of EED knockout mice had massive crypt degeneration and lower numbers of proliferating cells compared with wild-type control mice. Cdkn2a became derepressed and we detected increased levels of P21. We did not observe any differences between EZH2 knockout and control mice. Intestinal crypts from EED knockout mice had signs of aberrant differentiation of uncommitted crypt cells-these differentiated toward the secretory cell lineage. Furthermore, crypts from EED-knockout mice had impaired Wnt signaling and concomitant loss of intestinal stem cells, this phenotype was not reversed upon ectopic stimulation of Wnt and Notch signaling in organoids. Analysis of gene expression patterns from intestinal tissues of EED knockout mice showed dysregulation of several genes involved in Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling was regulated directly by PRC2.                In intestinal tissues of mice, PRC2 maintains small intestinal stem cells by promoting proliferation and preventing differentiation in the intestinal stem cell compartment. PRC2 controls gene expression in multiple signaling pathways that regulate intestinal homeostasis.

22948057        	Radiofrequency ablation: a safe and economical modality in treatment of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome.            	Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is an uncommon disease. Patients have a predisposition to develop cutaneous adnexal neoplasms such as cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, spiradenomas, trichoblastomas, basal cell carcinomas, follicular cysts, and organoid nevi. Malignant transformation of preexisting tumors also occurs in these individuals. Various techniques have been used for the treatment of trichoepitheliomas and cylindromas including excision, electrocautery, carbon dioxide laser ablation, cryosurgery, and radiotherapy. In our case, cylindromas were ablated by radiofrequency in multiple sittings. Trichoepitheliomas were ablated using coagulation mode with power # 3 to 3.5. Cosmetically acceptable results were obtained in 100 percent of the cylindromas and 70 percent of the trichoepitheliomas (Visual Analog Scale). The radiofrequency ablation technique under different modes can be used in both large tumors as well as smaller ones, especially in developing countries because it is very cost effective and easily accessible.	
29443026        	A Paired Bead and Magnet Array for Molding Microwells with Variable Concave Geometries.            	A spheroid culture is a useful tool for understanding cellular behavior in that it provides an in vivo-like three-dimensional environment. Various spheroid production methods such as non-adhesive surfaces, spinner flasks, hanging drops, and microwells have been used in studies of cell-to-cell interaction, immune-activation, drug screening, stem cell differentiation, and organoid generation. Among these methods, microwells with a three-dimensional concave geometry have gained the attention of scientists and engineers, given their advantages of uniform-sized spheroid generation and the ease with which the responses of individual spheroids can be monitored. Even though cost-effective methods such as the use of flexible membranes and ice lithography have been proposed, these techniques incur serious drawbacks such as difficulty in controlling the pattern sizes, achievement of high aspect ratios, and production of larger areas of microwells. To overcome these problems, we propose a robust method for fabricating concave microwells without the need for complex high-cost facilities. This method utilizes a 30 x 30 through-hole array, several hundred micrometer-order steel beads, and magnetic force to fabricate 900 microwells in a 3 cm x 3 cm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. To demonstrate the applicability of our method to cell biological applications, we cultured adipose stem cells for 3 days and successfully produced spheroids using our microwell platform. In addition, we performed a magnetostatic simulation to investigate the mechanism, whereby magnetic force was used to trap the steel beads in the through-holes. We believe that the proposed microwell fabrication method could be applied to many spheroid-based cellular studies such as drug screening, tissue regeneration, stem cell differentiation, and cancer metastasis.	
25816711        	Focal hyperhidrosis secondary to eccrine naevus successfully treated with botulinum toxin type A.            	Eccrine naevus (EN) is a rare skin hamartoma included in the organoid group of epidermal naevi, histologically defined as focal hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy of eccrine glands. Clinically, EN usually presents as hyperhidrotic patches with no visible skin changes, frequently located on the forearms. The decision to treat EN or not usually depends on the grade of hyperhidrosis, but there is no therapeutic consensus because of the rarity of this condition. We present a case diagnosed as EN in an adult patient with severe localized hyperhidrosis, which was successfully treated with botulinum toxin.                 © 2015 British Association of Dermatologists.	
24292484        	Niche-independent high-purity cultures of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells and their progeny.            	Although Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells have been expanded in vitro as organoids, homogeneous culture of these cells has not been possible thus far. Here we show that two small molecules, CHIR99021 and valproic acid, synergistically maintain self-renewal of mouse Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells, resulting in nearly homogeneous cultures. The colony-forming efficiency of cells from these cultures is ~100-fold greater than that of cells cultured in the absence of CHIR99021 and valproic acid, and multilineage differentiation ability is preserved. We made use of these homogeneous cultures to identify conditions employing simultaneous modulation of Wnt and Notch signaling to direct lineage differentiation into mature enterocytes, goblet cells and Paneth cells. Expansion in these culture conditions may be feasible for Lgr5(+) cells from the mouse stomach and colon and from the human small intestine. These methods provide new tools for the study and application of multiple intestinal epithelial cell types.	GEO                                            GSE51539
26973862        	Inverse-power-law behavior of cellular motility reveals stromal-epithelial cell interactions in 3D co-culture by OCT fluctuation spectroscopy.            	The progression of breast cancer is known to be affected by stromal cells within the local microenvironment. Here we study the effect of stromal fibroblasts on the in-place motions (motility) of mammary epithelial cells within organoids in 3D co-culture, inferred from the speckle fluctuation spectrum using optical coherence tomography (OCT). In contrast to Brownian motion, mammary cell motions exhibit an inverse power-law fluctuation spectrum. We introduce two complementary metrics for quantifying fluctuation spectra: the power-law exponent and a novel definition of the motility amplitude, both of which are signal- and position-independent. We find that the power-law exponent and motility amplitude are positively (p<0.001) and negatively (p<0.01) correlated with the density of stromal cells in 3D co-culture, respectively. We also show how the hyperspectral data can be visualized using these metrics to observe heterogeneity within organoids. This constitutes a simple and powerful tool for detecting and imaging cellular functional changes with OCT.	
30844579        	Novel Synergistic Combination of Mitotic Arrest and Promotion of Apoptosis for Treatment of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.            	The BCL-2 family of proteins, including anti-apoptotic members BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1, are part of a complex network that controls apoptosis. BH3-mimetics such as ABT-263 inhibit anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins and have been developed as potential cancer therapeutics. Aurora Kinase A (AKA) is over-expressed in pancreatic cancer (PC) and controls G2-M transition during mitosis and AKA inhibitors have been developed that induce mitotic arrest. We hypothesized that mitotic arrest induced by AKA inhibition may sensitize PC to accelerated apoptosis by a BH3-mimetic. Our results demonstrated that ABT-263 plus MLN8237 treatment showed greater activity than either single drug alone, as well as strong synergism, in the inhibition of growth of pancreatic cell lines (AsPC-1, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, HPAF-II) and PC patient-derived organoids (PDOs). The higher efficacy of combination treatment was attributable to the higher levels of induction of apoptosis and reduction of MCL-1 in PC cells and PDOs. In addition, combination therapy was more effective than single drug in the suppression of tumor growth in AsPC-1 xenograft mouse models. Together, our findings suggest that combination therapy with ABT-263 and MLN8237 should be considered for further exploration as a novel treatment of deadly PC disease.

A trans-DDP based monofunctional phenanthridine Pt(ii) complex was synthesized and characterized. Its anticancer activity was studied in vitro on a panel of human cancer cell lines and mouse intestinal cancer organoids. This complex displays significant antitumor properties, with a different spectrum of activity than that of classic bifunctional cross-linking agents like cisplatin.	
29986755        	Therapeutic potential of combined BRAF/MEK blockade in BRAF-wild type preclinical tumor models.            	Mounting evidence suggests that RAF-mediated MEK activation plays a crucial role in paradox MAPK (re)activation, leading to resistance and therapeutic failure with agents hitting a single step along the MAPK cascade.                We examined the molecular and functional effects of single and combined BRAF (dabrafenib), pan-RAF (RAF265), MEK (trametinib) and EGFR/HER2 (lapatinib) inhibition, using Western Blot and conservative isobologram analysis to assess functional synergism, and explored genetic determinants of synergistic interactions. Immunoprecipitation based assays were used to detect the interaction between BRAF and CRAF. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparing quantitative variables.                Here we demonstrated that a combination of MEK and BRAF inhibitors overcomes paradoxical MAPK activation (induced by BRAF inhibitors) in BRAF-wt/RAS-mut NSCLC and PDAC in vitro. This results in growth inhibitory synergism, both in vitro and in vivo, in the majority (65%) of the cellular models analyzed, encompassing cell lines and patient-derived cancer stem cells and organoids. However, RAS mutational status is not the sole determinant of functional synergism between RAF and MEK inhibitors, as demonstrated in KRAS isogenic tumor cell line models. Moreover, in EGFR-driven contexts, paradoxical MAPK (re)activation in response to selective BRAF inhibition was dependent on EGFR family signaling and could be offset by simultaneous EGFR/HER-2 blockade.                Overall, our data indicate that RAF inhibition-induced paradoxical MAPK activation could be exploited for therapeutic purposes by simultaneously targeting both RAF and MEK (and potentially EGFR family members) in appropriate molecular contexts. KRAS mutation per se does not effectively predict therapeutic synergism and other biomarkers need to be developed to identify patients potentially deriving benefit from combined BRAF/MEK targeting.	
33635598        	Detection of tumor-derived cell-free DNA from colorectal cancer peritoneal metastases in plasma and peritoneal fluid.            	Tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is an emerging biomarker for guiding the personalized treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). While patients with CRC liver metastases (CRC-LM) have relatively high levels of plasma cfDNA, little is known about patients with CRC peritoneal metastases (CRC-PM). This study evaluated the presence of tumor-derived cfDNA in plasma and peritoneal fluid (i.e. ascites or peritoneal washing) in 20 patients with isolated CRC-PM and in the plasma of 100 patients with isolated CRC-LM. Among tumor tissue KRAS/BRAF mutation carriers, tumor-derived cfDNA was detected by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) in plasma of 93% of CRC-LM and 20% of CRC-PM patients and in peritoneal fluid in all CRC-PM patients. Mutant allele fraction (MAF) and mutant copies per ml (MTc/ml) were lower in CRC-PM plasma than in CRC-LM plasma (median MAF = 0.28 versus 18.9%, p < 0.0001; median MTc/ml = 21 versus 1,758, p < 0.0001). Within patients with CRC-PM, higher cfDNA levels were observed in peritoneal fluid than in plasma (median MAF = 16.4 versus 0.28%, p = 0.0019; median MTc/ml = 305 versus 21, p = 0.0034). These data imply that tumor-derived cfDNA in plasma is a poor biomarker to monitor CRC-PM. Instead, cfDNA detection in peritoneal fluid may offer an alternative to guide CRC-PM treatment decisions.                © 2021 The Authors.

29437148        	Targeting p53-dependent stem cell loss for intestinal chemoprotection.            	The gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium is the fastest renewing adult tissue and is maintained by tissue-specific stem cells. Treatment-induced GI side effects are a major dose-limiting factor for chemotherapy and abdominal radiotherapy and can decrease the quality of life in cancer patients and survivors. p53 is a key regulator of the DNA damage response, and its activation results in stimulus- and cell type-specific outcomes via distinct effectors. We demonstrate that p53-dependent PUMA induction mediates chemotherapy-induced intestinal injury in mice. Genetic ablation of Puma, but not of p53, protects against chemotherapy-induced lethal GI injury. Blocking chemotherapy-induced loss of LGR5+ stem cells by Puma KO or a small-molecule PUMA inhibitor (PUMAi) prevents perturbation of the stem cell niche, rapid activation of WNT and NOTCH signaling, and stem cell exhaustion during repeated exposures. PUMAi also protects human and mouse colonic organoids against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and damage but does not protect cancer cells in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, targeting PUMA is a promising strategy for normal intestinal chemoprotection because it selectively blocks p53-dependent stem cell loss but leaves p53-dependent protective effects intact.

31289941        	A large-scale analysis of targeted metabolomics data from heterogeneous biological samples provides insights into metabolite dynamics.            	We previously developed a tandem mass spectrometry-based label-free targeted metabolomics analysis framework coupled to two distinct chromatographic methods, reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), with dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) for simultaneous detection of over 200 metabolites to study core metabolic pathways.                We aim to analyze a large-scale heterogeneous data compendium generated from our LC-MS/MS platform with both RPLC and HILIC methods to systematically assess measurement quality in biological replicate groups and to investigate metabolite abundance changes and patterns across different biological conditions.                Our metabolomics framework was applied in a wide range of experimental systems including cancer cell lines, tumors, extracellular media, primary cells, immune cells, organoids, organs (e.g. pancreata), tissues, and sera from human and mice. We also developed computational and statistical analysis pipelines, which include hierarchical clustering, replicate-group CV analysis, correlation analysis, and case-control paired analysis.                We generated a compendium of 42 heterogeneous deidentified datasets with 635 samples using both RPLC and HILIC methods. There exist metabolite signatures that correspond to various phenotypes of the heterogeneous datasets, involved in several metabolic pathways. The RPLC method shows overall better reproducibility than the HILIC method for most metabolites including polar amino acids. Correlation analysis reveals high confidence metabolites irrespective of experimental systems such as methionine, phenylalanine, and taurine. We also identify homocystine, reduced glutathione, and phosphoenolpyruvic acid as highly dynamic metabolites across all case-control paired samples.                Our study is expected to serve as a resource and a reference point for a systematic analysis of label-free LC-MS/MS targeted metabolomics data in both RPLC and HILIC methods with dMRM.	
30196404        	3D Bioprinting and Stem Cells.            	Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro modeling is increasingly relevant as two-dimensional (2D) cultures have been recognized with limits to recapitulate the complex endogenous conditions in the body. Additionally, fabrication technology is more accessible than ever. Bioprinting, in particular, is an additive manufacturing technique that expands the capabilities of in vitro studies by precisely depositing cells embedded within a 3D biomaterial scaffold that acts as temporary extracellular matrix (ECM). More importantly, bioprinting has vast potential for customization. This allows users to manipulate parameters such as scaffold design, biomaterial selection, and cell types, to create specialized biomimetic 3D systems.The development of a 3D system is important to recapitulate the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment since this particular organ cannot be mimicked with other methods such as organoids. The 3D system can be used to study the interactions between native BM cells and metastatic breast cancer cells (BCCs). Although not perfect, such a system can recapitulate the BM microenvironment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a key population within the BM, are known to communicate with BCCs invading the BM and to aid in their transition into dormancy. Dormant BCCs are cycling quiescent and resistant to chemotherapy, which allows them to survive in the BM to resurge even after decades. These persisting BCCs have been identified as the stem cell subset. These BCCs exhibit self-renewal and can be induced to differentiate. More importantly, this BCC subset can initiate tumor formation, exert chemoresistance, and form gap junction with endogenous BM stroma, including MSCs. The bioprinted model detailed in this chapter creates a MSC-BC stem cell coculture system to study intercellular interactions in a model that is more representative of the endogenous 3D microenvironment than conventional 2D cultures. The method can reliably seed primary BM MSCs and BC stem cells within a bioprinted scaffold fabricated from CELLINK Bioink. Since bioprinting is a highly customizable technique, parameters described in this method (i.e., cell-cell ratio, scaffold dimensions) can easily be altered to serve other applications, including studies on hematopoietic regulation.	
29153988        	Isolation and Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Human Fetal and iPSC-Derived Cone Photoreceptor Cells.            	Loss of cone photoreceptors, crucial for daylight vision, has the greatest impact on sight in retinal degeneration. Transplantation of stem cell-derived L/M-opsin cones, which form 90% of the human cone population, could provide a feasible therapy to restore vision. However, transcriptomic similarities between fetal and stem cell-derived cones remain to be defined, in addition to development of cone cell purification strategies. Here, we report an analysis of the human L/M-opsin cone photoreceptor transcriptome using an AAV2/9.pR2.1:GFP reporter. This led to the identification of a cone-enriched gene signature, which we used to demonstrate similar gene expression between fetal and stem cell-derived cones. We then defined a cluster of differentiation marker combination that, when used for cell sorting, significantly enriches for cone photoreceptors from the fetal retina and stem cell-derived retinal organoids, respectively. These data may facilitate more efficient isolation of human stem cell-derived cones for use in clinical transplantation studies.                Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

30246380        	Raman spectroscopy investigation of biochemical changes in tumor spheroids with aging and after treatment with staurosporine.            	There has been increasing use of in vitro cell culture models that more realistically replicate the three-dimensional (3D) environment found in vivo. Multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) using cell lines or patient-derived organoids have become an important in vitro drug development tool, where cells are grown in a 3D "sphere" that exhibits many of the characteristics found in vivo. Significantly, MTS develop gradients in nutrients and oxygen, commonly found in tumors that contribute to therapy resistance. While MTS show promise as a more realistic in vitro culture model, there is a massive need to improve imaging technologies for assessing biochemical characteristics and drug response in such models to maximize their translation into useful applications such as high throughput screening (HTS). In this study, we investigate the potential for Raman spectroscopy to unveil biochemical information in MTS and have investigated how spheroid age influences drug response, shedding light on increased therapy resistance in developing tumors. The wealth of molecular level information delivered by Raman spectroscopy in a noninvasive manner, could aid translation of these 3D models into HTS applications.                © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

31006632        	The Dlg Module and Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis Regulate EGFR Signaling and Cyst Cell-Germline Coordination in the Drosophila Testis.            	Tissue homeostasis and repair relies on proper communication of stem cells and their differentiating daughters with the local tissue microenvironment. In the Drosophila male germline adult stem cell lineage, germ cells proliferate and progressively differentiate enclosed in supportive somatic cyst cells, forming a small organoid, the functional unit of differentiation. Here we show that cell polarity and vesicle trafficking influence signal transduction in cyst cells, with profound effects on the germ cells they enclose. Our data suggest that the cortical components Dlg, Scrib, Lgl and the clathrin-mediated endocytic (CME) machinery downregulate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Knockdown of dlg, scrib, lgl, or CME components in cyst cells resulted in germ cell death, similar to increased signal transduction via the EGFR, while lowering EGFR or downstream signaling components rescued the defects. This work provides insights into how cell polarity and endocytosis cooperate to regulate signal transduction and sculpt developing tissues.                Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

33268331        	iPSC-derived hepatocytes generated from NASH donors provide a valuable platform for disease modeling and drug discovery.            	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 30-40% of adults and 10% of children in the US. About 20% of people with NAFLD develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer, and is projected to be a leading cause of liver transplantation in the near future. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from NASH patients are useful for generating a large number of hepatocytes for NASH modeling applications and identification of potential drug targets. We developed a novel defined in vitro differentiation process to generate cryopreservable hepatocytes using an iPSC panel of NASH donors and apparently healthy normal (AHN) controls. iPSC-derived hepatocytes displayed stage specific phenotypic markers, hepatocyte morphology, with bile canaliculi. Importantly, both fresh and cryopreserved definitive endoderm and hepatoblasts successfully differentiated to pure and functional hepatocytes with increased CYP3A4 activity in response to rifampicin and lipid accumulation upon fatty acid (FA) treatment. End-stage hepatocytes integrated into three-dimensional (3D) liver organoids and demonstrated increased levels of albumin secretion compared to aggregates consisting of hepatocytes alone. End-stage hepatocytes derived from NASH donors demonstrated spontaneous lipidosis without FA supplementation, recapitulating a feature of NASH hepatocytes in vivo Cryopreserved hepatocytes generated by this protocol across multiple donors will provide a critical cell source to facilitate the fundamental understanding of NAFLD/NASH biology and potential high throughput screening applications for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic targets.                © 2020.

29440379        	Targeting the cMET pathway augments radiation response without adverse effect on hearing in NF2 schwannoma models.            	Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) is a disease that needs new solutions. Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth causes progressive hearing loss, and the standard treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy, can further damage the nerve. There is an urgent need to identify an adjunct therapy that, by enhancing the efficacy of radiation, can help lower the radiation dose and preserve hearing. The mechanisms underlying deafness in NF2 are still unclear. One of the major limitations in studying tumor-induced hearing loss is the lack of mouse models that allow hearing testing. Here, we developed a cerebellopontine angle (CPA) schwannoma model that faithfully recapitulates the tumor-induced hearing loss. Using this model, we discovered that cMET blockade by crizotinib (CRZ) enhanced schwannoma radiosensitivity by enhancing DNA damage, and CRZ treatment combined with low-dose radiation was as effective as high-dose radiation. CRZ treatment had no adverse effect on hearing; however, it did not affect tumor-induced hearing loss, presumably because cMET blockade did not change tumor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels. This cMET gene knockdown study independently confirmed the role of the cMET pathway in mediating the effect of CRZ. Furthermore, we evaluated the translational potential of cMET blockade in human schwannomas. We found that human NF2-associated and sporadic VSs showed significantly elevated HGF expression and cMET activation compared with normal nerves, which correlated with tumor growth and cyst formation. Using organoid brain slice culture, cMET blockade inhibited the growth of patient-derived schwannomas. Our findings provide the rationale and necessary data for the clinical translation of combined cMET blockade with radiation therapy in patients with NF2.	
33122991        	Cell Calcium Imaging as a Reliable Method to Study Neuron-Glial Circuits.            	Complex dynamic cellular networks have been studied in physiological and pathological processes under the light of single-cell calcium imaging (SCCI), a method that correlates functional data based on calcium shifts operated by different intracellular and extracellular mechanisms integrated with their cell phenotypes. From the classic synaptic structure to tripartite astrocytic model or the recent quadripartite microglia added ensemble, as well as other physiological tissues, it is possible to follow how cells signal spatiotemporally to cellular patterns. This methodology has been used broadly due to the universal properties of calcium as a second messenger. In general, at least two types of receptor operate through calcium permeation: a fast-acting ionotropic receptor channel and a slow-activating metabotropic receptor, added to exchangers/transporters/pumps and intracellular Ca2+ release activated by messengers. These prototypes have gained an enormous amount of information in dynamic signaling circuits. SCCI has also been used as a method to associate phenotypic markers during development and stage transitions in progenitors, stem, vascular cells, neuro- and glioblasts, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia that operate through ion channels, transporters, and receptors. Also, cancer cells or inducible cell lines from human organoids characterized by transition stages are currently being used to model diseases or reconfigure healthy cells in terms of the expression of calcium-binding/permeable molecules and shed light on therapy.

32940048        	Procyanidin B2 Promotes Intestinal Injury Repair and Attenuates Colitis-Associated Tumorigenesis via Suppression of Oxidative Stress in Mice.            	Aims:                     Intact intestinal epithelium is essential to maintain normal intestinal physiological function. Irradiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease occurred when epithelial integrity was impaired. This study aims at exploring the mechanism of procyanidin B2 (PB2) administration to promote intestinal injury repair in mice.                         Results:                     PB2 treatment reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and protects the intestine damage from irradiation. Mechanistic studies reveal that PB2 could effectively slow down the degradation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and it significantly triggers Nrf2 into the nucleus, which leads to subsequent antioxidant enzyme expression. However, knockdown of Nrf2 attenuates PB2-induced protection in the intestine. More importantly, PB2 also promotes leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-positive intestinal stem cells (Lgr5+ ISCs) driven regeneration via enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which depends on, at least in part, activation of the Nrf2 signal. Evidence from an injury model of intestinal organoids is similar with in vivo results. Correspondingly, results from flow cytometric analysis and luciferase reporter assay reveal that PB2 also inhibits the level of ROS and promotes Lgr5 expression in vitro. Finally, PB2 alleviates the severity of experimental colitis and colitis-associated cancer in a long-term inflammatory model via inhibiting nuclear localization of p65.                         Innovation:                     This study, for the first time, reveals a role of PB2 for intestinal regeneration and repair after radiation or dextran sulfate sodium-induced injury in mice.                         Conclusion:                     Our results indicate that PB2 can repress oxidative stress via Nrf2/ARE signaling and then promote intestinal injury repair.	
32978370        	Modeling the function of BAX and BAK in early human brain development using iPSC-derived systems.            	Intrinsic apoptosis relies on the ability of the BCL-2 family to induce the formation of pores on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Previous studies have shown that both BAX and BAK are essential during murine embryogenesis, and reports in human cancer cell lines identified non-canonical roles for BAX and BAK in mitochondrial fission during apoptosis. BAX and BAK function in human brain development remains elusive due to the lack of appropriate model systems. Here, we generated BAX/BAK double knockout human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), neural rosettes, and cerebral organoids to uncover the effects of BAX and BAK deletion in an in vitro model of early human brain development. We found that BAX and BAK-deficient cells have abnormal mitochondrial morphology and give rise to aberrant cortical structures. We suggest crucial functions for BAX and BAK during human development, including maintenance of homeostatic mitochondrial morphology, which is crucial for proper development of progenitors and neurons of the cortex. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived systems can be useful platforms to reveal novel functions of the apoptotic machinery in neural development.	
28791807        	Proceedings: Regenerative Medicine for Lung Diseases: A CIRM Workshop Report.            	The mission of the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) is to accelerate treatments to patients with unmet medical needs. In September 2016, CIRM sponsored a workshop held at the University of California, Los Angeles, to discuss regenerative medicine approaches for treatment of lung diseases and to identify the challenges remaining for advancing such treatments to the clinic and market approval. Workshop participants discussed current preclinical and clinical approaches to regenerative medicine in the lung, as well as the biology of lung stem cells and the role of stem cells in the etiology of various lung diseases. The outcome of this effort was the recognition that whereas transient cell delivery approaches are leading the way in the clinic, recent advances in the understanding of lung stem cell biology, in vitro and in vivo disease modeling, gene editing and replacement methods, and cell engraftment approaches raise the prospect of developing cures for some lung diseases in the foreseeable future. In addition, advances in in vitro modeling using lung organoids and "lung on a chip" technology are setting the stage for high quality small molecule drug screening to develop treatments for lung diseases with complex biology.

31090832        	Do you know this syndrome? Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome.            	Nevus sebaceous is the most common type of organoid epidermal nevus, often located on the face, following the Blaschko's lines and with alterations in the ipsilateral central nervous system. Distinct disorders can be distinguished by the type of association with epidermal nevus. Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by sebaceous nevus associated with extracutaneous abnormalities affecting the brain, eyes and bones. We report the case of an 8-year-old female patient with a yellowish verrucous plaque on the left temporal area extending ipsilaterally to the cervical region, combined with cicatricial alopecia, periocular nodule, and epibulbar tumors.	
32913182        	Defining the susceptibility of colorectal cancers to BH3-mimetic compounds.            	Novel targets are required to improve the outcomes for patients with colorectal cancers. In this regard, the selective inhibitor of the pro-survival protein BCL2, venetoclax, has proven highly effective in several hematological malignancies. In addition to BCL2, potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitors of its relatives, BCLxL and MCL1, are now available, prompting us to investigate the susceptibility of colorectal cancers to the inhibition of one or more of these pro-survival proteins. While targeting BCLxL, but not BCL2 or MCL1, on its own had some impact, most (15/17) of the immortalized colorectal cancer cell lines studied were efficiently killed by the combined targeting of BCLxL and MCL1. Importantly, these in vitro findings were confirmed in a xenograft model and, interestingly, in all (5/5) patient derived tumor organoids evaluated. Our results lend strong support to the notion that BCLxL and MCL1 are highly promising targets for further evaluation in efforts to improve the treatment of colorectal cancers.	
22430769        	Ectopic sphenoid sinus pituitary adenoma (ESSPA) with normal anterior pituitary gland: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 32 cases with a comprehensive review of the english literature.            	Ectopic sphenoid sinus pituitary adenoma (ESSPA) may arise from a remnant of Rathke's pouch. These tumors are frequently misdiagnosed as other neuroendocrine or epithelial neoplasms which may develop in this site (olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, paraganglioma, melanoma). Thirty-two patients with ESSPA identified in patients with normal pituitary glands (intact sella turcica) were retrospectively retrieved from the consultation files of the authors' institutions. Clinical records were reviewed with follow-up obtained. An immunohistochemical panel was performed on available material.   Sixteen males and 16 females, aged 2-84 years (mean, 57.1 years), presented with chronic sinusitis, headache, obstructive symptoms, and visual field defects, although several were asymptomatic (n = 6). By definition, the tumors were centered within the sphenoid sinus and demonstrated, by imaging studies or intraoperative examination, a normal sella turcica without a concurrent pituitary adenoma. A subset of tumors showed extension into the nasal cavity (n = 5) or nasopharynx (n = 9). Mean tumor size was 3.4 cm. The majority of tumors were beneath an intact respiratory epithelium (n = 22), arranged in many different patterns (solid, packets, organoid, pseudorosette-rosette, pseudopapillary, single file, glandular, trabecular, insular). Bone involvement was frequently seen (n = 21). Secretions were present (n = 16). Necrosis was noted in 8 tumors. The tumors showed a variable cellularity, with polygonal, plasmacytoid, granular, and oncocytic tumor cells. Severe pleomorphism was uncommon (n = 5). A delicate, salt-and-pepper chromatin distribution was seen. In addition, there were intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (n = 25) and multinucleated tumor cells (n = 18). Mitotic figures were infrequent, with a mean of 1 per 10 HPFs and a <1% proliferation index (Ki-67). There was a vascularized to sclerotic or calcified stroma. Immunohistochemistry highlighted the endocrine nature of the tumors, with synaptophysin (97%), CD56 (91%), NSE (76%) and chromogranin (71%); while pan-cytokeratin was positive in 79%, frequently with a dot-like Golgi accentuation (50%). Reactivity with pituitary hormones included 48% reactive for 2 or more hormones (plurihormonal), and 33% reactive for a single hormone, with prolactin seen most frequently (59%); 19% of cases were non-reactive. The principle differential diagnosis includes olfactory neuroblastoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, melanoma, and meningioma. All patients were treated with surgery. No patients died from disease, although one patient died with persistent disease (0.8 months). Surgery is curative in the majority of cases, although recurrence/persistence was seen in 4 patients (13.8%). In conclusion, ESSPAs are rare, affecting middle aged patients with non-specific symptoms, showing characteristic light microscopy and immunohistochemical features of their intrasellar counterparts. When encountering a tumor within the sphenoid sinus, ectopic pituitary adenoma must be considered, and pertinent imaging, clinical, and immunohistochemical evaluation undertaken to exclude tumors within the differential diagnosis. This will result in accurate classification, helping to prevent the potentially untoward side effects or complications of incorrect therapy.	
24550116        	Developmental stratification of the mammary epithelium occurs through symmetry-breaking vertical divisions of apically positioned luminal cells.            	Mammary ducts are elongated during development by stratified epithelial structures, known as terminal end buds (TEBs). TEBs exhibit reduced apicobasal polarity and extensive proliferation. A major unanswered question concerns the mechanism by which the simple ductal epithelium stratifies during TEB formation. We sought to elucidate this mechanism using real-time imaging of growth factor-induced stratification in 3D cultures of mouse primary epithelial organoids. We hypothesized that stratification could result from vertical divisions in either the apically positioned luminal epithelial cells or the basally positioned myoepithelial cells. Stratification initiated exclusively from vertical apical cell divisions, both in 3D culture and in vivo. During vertical apical divisions, only the mother cell retained tight junctions and segregated apical membranes. Vertical daughter cells initiated an unpolarized cell population located between the luminal and myoepithelial cells, similar to the unpolarized body cells in the TEB. As stratification and loss of apicobasal polarity are early hallmarks of cancer, we next determined the cellular mechanism of oncogenic stratification. Expression of activated ERBB2 induced neoplastic stratification through analogous vertical divisions of apically positioned luminal epithelial cells. However, ERBB2-induced stratification was accompanied by tissue overgrowth and acute loss of both tight junctions and apical polarity. Expression of phosphomimetic MEK (MEK1DD), a major ERBB2 effector, also induced stratification through vertical apical cell divisions. However, MEK1DD-expressing organoids exhibited normal levels of growth and retained apicobasal polarity. We conclude that both normal and neoplastic stratification are accomplished through receptor tyrosine kinase signaling dependent vertical cell divisions within the luminal epithelial cell layer.	
27766200        	Glomus tumor in teen and repetition pneumonia: Case report.            	Glomus tumors are uncommon tumors that are originated from smooth muscle cells of the neuromioarterials glomus bodies located in the arteriovenous anastomoses subcutaneous tissue or deep dermis of the extremities, mainly in the palms of the hands, wrists and subungual areas of the fingers. Carcinoid tumor, as the glomus tumor, can show an organoid pattern, increased vascularity, and uniform, round cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, but usually are positive for cytokeratin and always stained with chromogranin and synaptophysin showing negative for smooth muscle markers which is presented in our case. Glomus tumors have a good prognosis and surgical resection is the treatment of choice. In our case, the patient underwent pulmonary bilobectomy because of the location of the tumor in the transition between the middle lobe and the basal bronchial trunk right lower lobe divisions. It is presented thus a glomus tumor with exceptional localization (pulmonary and bronchial) of benign histological features, according to most of the cases reported in the literature emphasizing their particular rare location, histological, and immunohistochemical profile, which helps the differential diagnosis with other most common tumors of bronchial location.	
32020347        	Materials and Microenvironments for Engineering the Intestinal Epithelium.            	The barrier functions of the gastrointestinal tract rely in large part on a single layer of columnar intestinal epithelial cells. These epithelial cells are mediators of intestinal homeostasis, regulating and communicating biochemical signals between underlying stromal cells and luminal cues. The development of representative in vitro models to recapitulate the gastrointestinal epithelium is crucial to understanding cell-cell interactions during intestinal homeostasis and dysfunction. Ideally, models would contain microbiota/immune cells, polarized intestinal architecture, multilayered cellular complexity, extracellular matrix, biochemical cues, and mechanical deformation. This review focuses on historical and state of the art biomaterials and substrates used in the field to establish static and fluidic models of the intestinal epithelium. A discussion of conventional adenocarcinoma colon cancer cell lines, primary intestinal epithelial cells derived from organoids, and stromal support cells such as enteric neurons, myofibroblasts, and immune cells, as well as the importance of increasing cellular complexity and future outlook is included.	
31827136        	Mutant IDH1 confers resistance to energy stress in normal biliary cells through PFKP-induced aerobic glycolysis and AMPK activation.            	Metabolism is a critical regulator of cell fate determination. Recently, the significance of metabolic reprogramming in environmental adaptation during tumorigenesis has attracted much attention in cancer research. Recurrent mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 genes have been identified in several cancers, including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Mutant IDHs convert α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which affects the activity of multiple α-KG-dependent dioxygenases including histone lysine demethylases. Although mutant IDH can be detected even in the early stages of neoplasia, how IDH mutations function as oncogenic drivers remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to address the biological effects of IDH1 mutation using intrahepatic biliary organoids (IBOs). We demonstrated that mutant IDH1 increased the formation of IBOs as well as accelerated glucose metabolism. Gene expression analysis and ChIP results revealed the upregulation of platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFKP), which is a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, through the alteration of histone modification. Knockdown of the Pfkp gene alleviated the mutant IDH1-induced increase in IBO formation. Notably, the high expression of PFKP was observed more frequently in patients with IDH-mutant ICC compared to in those with wild-type IDH (p < 0.01, 80.9% vs. 42.5%, respectively). Furthermore, IBOs expressing mutant IDH1 survived the suppression of ATP production caused by growth factor depletion and matrix detachment by retaining high ATP levels through 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Our findings provide a systematic understanding as to how mutant IDH induces tumorigenic preconditioning by metabolic rewiring in intrahepatic cholangiocytes.	
27508272        	Primary ovarian neuroendocrine tumor arising in association with a mature cystic teratoma: A case report.            	Primary ovarian carcinoid tumors are exceptionally rare entities accounting for approximately 0.1% of all ovarian neoplasms. This report describes a primary ovarian neuroendocrine tumor arising in association with a mature cystic teratoma in a 65 year-old woman. Macroscopically, the unilateral adnexal tumor was composed of cystic, solid and mucinous elements which resolved into a dual component lesion histologically. The majority of the tumor displayed an organoid architecture with mild to moderate pleomorphism and no discernible mitotic activity, while approximately 10% consisted of sheets and groups of cells with highly pleomorphic nuclei, necrosis and occasional mitoses. Features of a mature cystic teratoma were seen very focally. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong, diffuse positivity for CD56 and synaptophysin. Chromogranin immunonegativity was noted and there was an absence of nuclear β-catenin accumulation. Ki-67 index was 10-12%. Although there is no established diagnostic framework for primary ovarian carcinoid tumors, this case was diagnosed as a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, Grade 2 (intermediate grade), arising in association with a mature cystic teratoma/dermoid cyst. This case highlights the need to develop ovarian diagnostic criteria in this area.	
32243780        	A Metformin-Responsive Metabolic Pathway Controls Distinct Steps in Gastric Progenitor Fate Decisions and Maturation.            	Cellular metabolism plays important functions in dictating stem cell behaviors, although its role in stomach epithelial homeostasis has not been evaluated in depth. Here, we show that the energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) governs gastric epithelial progenitor differentiation. Administering the AMPK activator metformin decreases epithelial progenitor proliferation and increases acid-secreting parietal cells (PCs) in mice and organoids. AMPK activation targets Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), known to govern progenitor proliferation and PC fate choice, and PGC1α, which we show controls PC maturation after their specification. PC-specific deletion of AMPKα or PGC1α causes defective PC maturation, which could not be rescued by metformin. However, metformin treatment still increases KLF4 levels and suppresses progenitor proliferation. Thus, AMPK activates KLF4 in progenitors to reduce self-renewal and promote PC fate, whereas AMPK-PGC1α activation within the PC lineage promotes maturation, providing a potential suggestion for why metformin increases acid secretion and reduces gastric cancer risk in humans.

30234074        	Three-dimensional tumor cell cultures employed in virotherapy research.            	Oncolytic virotherapy constitutes an upcoming alternative treatment option for a broad spectrum of cancer entities. However, despite great research efforts, there is still only a single US Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency-approved oncolytic virus available for clinical use. One reason for that is the gap between promising preclinical data and limited clinical success. Since oncolytic viruses are biological agents, they might require more realistic in vitro tumor models than common monolayer tumor cell cultures to provide meaningful predictive preclinical evaluation results. For more realistic invitro tumor models, three-dimensional tumor cell-culture systems can be employed in preclinical virotherapy research. This review provides an overview of spheroid and hydrogel tumor cell cultures, organotypic tumor-tissue slices, organotypic raft cultures, and tumor organoids utilized in the context of oncolytic virotherapy. Furthermore, we also discuss advantages, disadvantages, techniques, and difficulties of these three-dimensional tumor cell-culture systems when applied specifically in virotherapy research.	
22317889        	Pure apocrine nevus:  a report of 4 cases.            	Apocrine nevus is a rare tumor composed of increased mature apocrine glands and ductal structures within a fibrous stroma, located predominantly in the reticular dermis. They have been reported in association with apocrine carcinoma, extramammary Paget disease, and syringocystadenoma papilliferum; less commonly a pure apocrine nevus is identified, unassociated with another apocrine proliferation. Clinically apocrine nevi may appear as solitary or multiple nodules or plaques on the scalp, presternal skin, though they are seen most commonly in the axillae. We describe 4 cases of pure apocrine nevus, all of which appeared clinically as painless or mildly tender skin-colored axillary masses, 2 of which were bilateral. In each case, the lesions appeared in adulthood, and patients denied knowledge of congenital or childhood presence. Patients denied pruritis, discharge, bleeding, or antecedent trauma. Grossly, the specimens consisted of subcutaneous, multicystic ill-defined nodules. Biopsy showed prominent apocrine glands composed of irregularly columnar luminal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in a somewhat organoid pattern filling the reticular dermis and extending into the subcutaneous adipose tissue. The glandular luminal cells displayed decapitation secretion. There was a paucity of pilosebaceous units. In one case, the overlying epidermis was papillomatous. The deepest portion of one specimen had lactational change simulating a lactational adenoma. No atypia was seen in either the glandular structures or the stroma. The adjacent sebaceous and eccrine structures were normal. The histologic features and immunohistochemical profile in relation to other apocrine lesions will be reviewed.	
31409002        	Biological Significance of Tumor Heterogeneity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.            	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common and aggressive malignancy, with hitherto dismal clinical outcome. Genomic analyses of patient samples reveal a complex heterogeneous landscape for ESCC, which presents in both intertumor and intratumor forms, manifests at both genomic and epigenomic levels, and contributes significantly to tumor evolution, drug resistance, and metastasis. Here, we review the important molecular characteristics underlying ESCC heterogeneity, with an emphasis on genomic aberrations and their functional contribution to cancer evolutionary trajectories. We further discuss how novel experimental tools, including single-cell sequencing and three-dimensional organoids, may advance our understanding of tumor heterogeneity. Lastly, we suggest that deciphering the mechanisms governing tumor heterogeneity holds the potential to developing precision therapeutics for ESCC patients.	
28840050        	Gastric Medullary Carcinoma with Sporadic Mismatch Repair Deficiency and a TP53 R273C Mutation: An Unusual Case with Wild-Type BRAF.            	Medullary carcinoma has long been recognized as a subtype of colorectal cancer associated with microsatellite instability and Lynch syndrome. Gastric medullary carcinoma is a very rare neoplasm. We report a 67-year-old male who presented with a solitary gastric mass. Total gastrectomy revealed a well-demarcated, poorly differentiated carcinoma with an organoid growth pattern, pushing borders, and abundant peritumoral lymphocytic response. The prior cytology was cellular with immunohistochemical panel consistent with upper gastrointestinal/pancreaticobiliary origin. Overall, the histopathologic findings were consistent with gastric medullary carcinoma. A mismatch repair panel revealed a mismatch repair protein deficient tumor with loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression. BRAF V600E immunostain (VE1) and BRAF molecular testing were negative, indicating a wild-type gene. Tumor sequencing of MLH1 demonstrated a wild-type gene, while our molecular panel identified TP53 c.817C>T (p.R273C) mutation. These findings were compatible with a sporadic tumor. Given that morphologically identical medullary tumors often occur in Lynch syndrome, it is possible that mismatch repair loss is an early event in sporadic tumors with p53 mutation being a late event. Despite having wild-type BRAF, this tumor is sporadic and unrelated to Lynch syndrome. This case report demonstrates that coordinate ancillary studies are needed to resolve sporadic versus hereditary rare tumors.	
31972557        	Optimization of FLIM imaging, fitting and analysis for auto-fluorescent NAD(P)H and FAD in cells and tissues.            	Increasingly, the auto-fluorescent coenzymes NAD(P)H and FAD are being tracked by multi-photon fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM) and used as versatile markers for changes in mammalian metabolism. The cellular redox state of different cell model systems, organoids and tissue sections is investigated in a range of pathologies where the metabolism is disrupted or reprogrammed; the latter is particularly relevant in cancer biology. Yet, the actual optimized process of acquiring images by FLIM, execute a correct lifetime fitting procedure and subsequent processing and analysis can be challenging for new users. Questions remain of how to optimize FLIM experiments, whether any potential photo-bleaching affects FLIM results and whether fixed specimens can be used in experiments. We have broken down the multi-step sequence into best-practice application of FLIM for NAD(P)H and FAD imaging, with images generated by a time-correlated-single-photon-counting (TCSPC) system, fitted with Becker & Hickl software and further processed with open-source ImageJ/Fiji and Python software.	
33104794        	Combined EZH2 and Bcl-2 inhibitors as precision therapy for genetically defined DLBCL subtypes.            	Molecular alterations in the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 frequently co-occur in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Because DLBCL tumors with these characteristics are likely dependent on both oncogenes, dual targeting of EZH2 and Bcl-2 is a rational therapeutic approach. We hypothesized that EZH2 and Bcl-2 inhibition would be synergistic in DLBCL. To test this, we evaluated the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat and the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax in DLBCL cells, 3-dimensional lymphoma organoids, and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We found that tazemetostat and venetoclax are synergistic in DLBCL cells and 3-dimensional lymphoma organoids that harbor an EZH2 mutation and an IGH/BCL2 translocation but not in wild-type cells. Tazemetostat treatment results in upregulation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and priming of mitochondria to BH3-mediated apoptosis, which may sensitize cells to venetoclax. The combination of tazemetostat and venetoclax was also synergistic in vivo. In DLBCL PDXs, short-course combination therapy resulted in complete remissions that were durable over time and associated with superior overall survival compared with either drug alone.                © 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.	
30060804        	Wnt/PCP controls spreading of Wnt/β-catenin signals by cytonemes in vertebrates.            	Signaling filopodia, termed cytonemes, are dynamic actin-based membrane structures that regulate the exchange of signaling molecules and their receptors within tissues. However, how cytoneme formation is regulated remains unclear. Here, we show that Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) autocrine signaling controls the emergence of cytonemes, and that cytonemes subsequently control paracrine Wnt/β-catenin signal activation. Upon binding of the Wnt family member Wnt8a, the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 becomes activated. Ror2/PCP signaling leads to the induction of cytonemes, which mediate the transport of Wnt8a to neighboring cells. In the Wnt-receiving cells, Wnt8a on cytonemes triggers Wnt/β-catenin-dependent gene transcription and proliferation. We show that cytoneme-based Wnt transport operates in diverse processes, including zebrafish development, murine intestinal crypt and human cancer organoids, demonstrating that Wnt transport by cytonemes and its control via the Ror2 pathway is highly conserved in vertebrates.                © 2018, Mattes et al.	
28126842        	Integrin suppresses neurogenesis and regulates brain tissue assembly in planarian regeneration.            	Animals capable of adult regeneration require specific signaling to control injury-induced cell proliferation, specification and patterning, but comparatively little is known about how the regeneration blastema assembles differentiating cells into well-structured functional tissues. Using the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea as a model, we identify β1-integrin as a crucial regulator of blastema architecture. β1-integrin(RNAi) animals formed small head blastemas with severe tissue disorganization, including ectopic neural spheroids containing differentiated neurons normally found in distinct organs. By mimicking aspects of normal brain architecture but without normal cell-type regionalization, these spheroids bore a resemblance to mammalian tissue organoids synthesized in vitro We identified one of four planarian integrin-alpha subunits inhibition of which phenocopied these effects, suggesting that a specific receptor controls brain organization through regeneration. Neoblast stem cells and progenitor cells were mislocalized in β1-integrin(RNAi) animals without significantly altered body-wide patterning. Furthermore, tissue disorganization phenotypes were most pronounced in animals undergoing brain regeneration and not homeostatic maintenance or regeneration-induced remodeling of the brain. These results suggest that integrin signaling ensures proper progenitor recruitment after injury, enabling the generation of large-scale tissue organization within the regeneration blastema.                © 2017.

26884394        	Stomach development, stem cells and disease.            	The stomach, an organ derived from foregut endoderm, secretes acid and enzymes and plays a key role in digestion. During development, mesenchymal-epithelial interactions drive stomach specification, patterning, differentiation and growth through selected signaling pathways and transcription factors. After birth, the gastric epithelium is maintained by the activity of stem cells. Developmental signals are aberrantly activated and stem cell functions are disrupted in gastric cancer and other disorders. Therefore, a better understanding of stomach development and stem cells can inform approaches to treating these conditions. This Review highlights the molecular mechanisms of stomach development and discusses recent findings regarding stomach stem cells and organoid cultures, and their roles in investigating disease mechanisms.                 © 2016.

32325086        	Notch Signaling Mediates Differentiation in Barrett's Esophagus and Promotes Progression to Adenocarcinoma.            	Studies are needed to determine the mechanism by which Barrett's esophagus (BE) progresses to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Notch signaling maintains stem cells in the gastrointestinal tract and is dysregulated during carcinogenesis. We explored the relationship between Notch signaling and goblet cell maturation, a feature of BE, during EAC pathogenesis.                We measured goblet cell density and levels of Notch messenger RNAs in BE tissues from 164 patients, with and without dysplasia or EAC, enrolled in a multicenter study. We analyzed the effects of conditional expression of an activated form of NOTCH2 (pL2.Lgr5.N2IC), conditional deletion of NOTCH2 (pL2.Lgr5.N2fl/fl), or loss of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (pL2.Lgr5.p65fl/fl), in Lgr5+ (progenitor) cells in L2-IL1B mice (which overexpress interleukin 1 beta in esophagus and squamous forestomach and are used as a model of BE). We collected esophageal and stomach tissues and performed histology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, transcriptome, and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. Cardia and forestomach tissues from mice were cultured as organoids and incubated with inhibitors of Notch or NF-kB.                Progression of BE to EAC was associated with a significant reduction in goblet cell density comparing nondysplastic regions of tissues from patients; there was an inverse correlation between goblet cell density and levels of NOTCH3 and JAG2 messenger RNA. In mice, expression of the activated intracellular form of NOTCH2 in Lgr5+ cells reduced goblet-like cell maturation, increased crypt fission, and accelerated the development of tumors in the squamocolumnar junction. Mice with deletion of NOTCH2 from Lgr5+ cells had increased maturation of goblet-like cells, reduced crypt fission, and developed fewer tumors. Esophageal tissues from in pL2.Lgr5.N2IC mice had increased levels of RelA (which encodes the p65 unit of NF-κB) compared to tissues from L2-IL1B mice, and we found evidence of increased NF-κB activity in Lgr5+ cells. Esophageal tissues from pL2.Lgr5.p65fl/fl mice had lower inflammation and metaplasia scores than pL2.Lgr5.N2IC mice. In organoids derived from pL2-IL1B mice, the NF-κB inhibitor JSH-23 reduced cell survival and proliferation.                Notch signaling contributes to activation of NF-κB and regulates differentiation of gastric cardia progenitor cells in a mouse model of BE. In human esophageal tissues, progression of BE to EAC was associated with reduced goblet cell density and increased levels of Notch expression. Strategies to block this pathway might be developed to prevent EAC in patients with BE.                Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
32253265        	Tumor Microenvironment Is Critical for the Maintenance of Cellular States Found in Primary Glioblastomas.            	Glioblastoma (GBM), an incurable tumor, remains difficult to model and more importantly to treat due to its genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity and plasticity across cellular states. The ability of current tumor models to recapitulate the cellular states found in primary tumors remains unexplored. To address this issue, we compared single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor cells from 5 patients across four patient-specific glioblastoma stem cell (GSC)-derived model types, including glioma spheres, tumor organoids, glioblastoma cerebral organoids (GLICO), and patient-derived xenografts. We find that GSCs within the GLICO model are enriched for a neural progenitor-like cell subpopulation and recapitulate the cellular states and their plasticity found in the corresponding primary parental tumors. These data demonstrate how the contribution of a neuroanatomically accurate human microenvironment is critical and sufficient for recapitulating the cellular states found in human primary GBMs, a principle that may likely apply to other tumor models. SIGNIFICANCE: It has been unclear how well different patient-derived GBM models are able to recreate the full heterogeneity of primary tumors. Here, we provide a complete transcriptomic characterization of the major model types. We show that the microenvironment is crucial for recapitulating GSC cellular states, highlighting the importance of tumor-host cell interactions.See related commentary by Luo and Weiss, p. 907.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 890.                ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.	
21963237        	Ectopic secretion of GHRH by a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor associated with an empty sella.            	Acromegaly is usually the result of a pituitary growth hormone cell-adenoma or is more rarely due to ectopic secretion of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH).We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with acromegaly due to a GH-RH-secreting pancreatic tumor. Laboratory evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of acromegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a partial empty sella with no signs of adenoma. Ultrasound sonography performed for abdominal pains showed a calcified large heterogeneous infrahepatic mass. Computed tomography scan discovered a heterogeneous pancreatic head mass with a diameter of 10cm. Measurement of fasting plasma GHRH was performed showing a high concentration of 604ng/L (normal 10-60). We therefore concluded that the acromegaly was caused by ectopic overproduction of GHRH likely due to the pancreatic tumor. The patient underwent a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy. Histology revealed a well-circumscribed tumor with organoid architecture. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated diffuse positivity for chromogranin A, neuronal specific enolase and synaptophysin and negative immunoreactivity for prolactin, GH and serotonin. These features were concordant with a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. Surgical resection of this pancreatic tumor was followed by significant amelioration of acromegalic signs and normalization of GHRH and GH levels.                Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.	
29503158        	Enteroid Monolayers Reveal an Autonomous WNT and BMP Circuit Controlling Intestinal Epithelial Growth and Organization.            	The intestinal epithelium maintains a remarkable balance between proliferation and differentiation despite rapid cellular turnover. A central challenge is to elucidate mechanisms required for robust control of tissue renewal. Opposing WNT and BMP signaling is essential in establishing epithelial homeostasis. However, it has been difficult to disentangle contributions from multiple sources of morphogen signals in the tissue. Here, to dissect epithelial-autonomous morphogenic signaling circuits, we developed an enteroid monolayer culture system that recapitulates four key properties of the intestinal epithelium, namely the ability to maintain proliferative and differentiated zones, self-renew, polarize, and generate major intestinal cell types. We systematically perturb intrinsic and extrinsic sources of WNT and BMP signals to reveal a core morphogenic circuit that controls proliferation, tissue organization, and cell fate. Our work demonstrates the ability of intestinal epithelium, even in the absence of 3D tissue architecture, to control its own growth and organization through morphogen-mediated feedback.

24974412        	A case of laryngeal sialolipoma: pathology in focus.            	We are reporting a rare case of laryngeal sialolipoma in a 66-year-old male affected by Parkinson's disease. He was evaluated for dysarthria and swallowing disorders during which a swelling of the left ventricular fold, was always present and enlarged over a span of six months. Surgical removal of the left ventricular fold was performed. Microscopic examination, showed a circumscribed mass with organoid seromucous glands surrounded by numerous mature adipocytes, separated from the parenchyma and fatty tissue by dense fibrous tissue. This mass fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of sialolipoma. Sialolipomas can develop in a variety of sites in which there is both adipose and salivary gland tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first case of sialolipoma arising in the larynx.	
29116005        	Composite intestinal adenoma-microcarcinoid in the colon and rectum: a case series and historical review.            	Composite intestinal adenoma-microcarcinoid (CIAM) is a rare colorectal lesion that mostly comprises a conventional adenomatous component with a minute proportion of neuroendocrine (NE) component. Although microcarcinoids are well-recognized in the setting of chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, large intestinal microcarcinoids associated with intestinal adenoma are exceedingly rare and their clinicopathologic characteristics are yet to be elucidated. This study was performed to clarify their clinicopathologic characteristics and to review the relevant literature.                In total, 24 cases of CIAM in which tumors were excised endoscopically (n = 22) or surgically (n = 2) were retrieved from the Department of Pathology, Daehang Hospital. We analyzed their clinicopathologic characteristics and performed immunohistochemical staining for NE markers to determine their endocrine nature.                CIAM usually developed in middle-aged and elderly patients, with a mean age of 62.0 years (range, 44-81 years). Thirteen patients were men and 11 were women, indicating a nearly equal sex ratio. Unlike classic carcinoid tumors, CIAMs occurred mostly in the colon (83.3% of cases), particularly in the proximal colon. Histologically, the microcarcinoid component consisted of low-grade NE cells arranged in small nests, glands or cords interspersed with glandular elements or less frequently resembled squamous morules. There was no expansile nodular or organoid growth pattern, which is typical of carcinoid tumors. The microcarcinoids were 1-20 mm in size (mean size, 4.7 mm) and were mostly situated in the basal lamina propria with no submucosal layer involvement; none showed desmoplastic reaction or increased proliferative activity. Follow-up data (mean, 23.1 months) were available for 18 patients; all patients are alive and well.                To the best of our knowledge, ours is the largest series of patients with CIAM in the English-language literature. Microcarcinoids found in CIAMs appear to show favorable clinical outcomes regardless of their size, likely due to the absence of submucosal extension and/or increased proliferative activity. We recommend avoiding additional radical surgeries in patients who have endoscopically undergone complete CIAM excision unless they exhibit ominous histologic features such as submucosal extension or increased proliferative activity.	
32112097        	GO: a functional reporter system to identify and enrich base editing activity.            	Base editing (BE) is a powerful tool for engineering single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and has been used to create targeted mutations in cell lines, organoids and animal models. Recent development of new BE enzymes has provided an extensive toolkit for genome modification; however, identifying and isolating edited cells for analysis has proven challenging. Here we report a 'Gene On' (GO) reporter system that indicates precise cytosine or adenine base editing in situ with high sensitivity and specificity. We test GO using an activatable GFP and use it to measure the kinetics, efficiency and PAM specificity of a range of new BE variants. Further, GO is flexible and can be easily adapted to induce expression of numerous genetically encoded markers, antibiotic resistance genes or enzymes, such as Cre recombinase. With these tools, GO can be exploited to functionally link BE events at endogenous genomic loci to cellular enzymatic activities in human and mouse cell lines and organoids. Thus, GO provides a powerful approach to increase the practicality and feasibility of implementing CRISPR BE in biomedical research.                © The Author(s) 2020.

31200143        	Neurturin-containing laminin matrices support innervated branching epithelium from adult epithelial salispheres.            	Cell transplantation of autologous adult biopsies, grown ex vivo as epithelial organoids or expanded as spheroids, are proposed treatments to regenerate damaged branching organs. However, it is not clear whether transplantation of adult organoids or spheroids alone is sufficient to initiate a fetal-like program of branching morphogenesis in which coordinated branching of multiple cell types including nerves, mesenchyme and blood vessels occurs. Yet this is an essential concept for the regeneration of branching organs such as lung, pancreas, and lacrimal and salivary glands. Here, we used factors identified from fetal organogenesis to maintain and expand adult murine and human epithelial salivary gland progenitors in non-adherent spheroid cultures, called salispheres. These factors stimulated critical developmental pathways, and increased expression of epithelial progenitor markers such as Keratin5, Keratin14, FGFR2b and KIT. Moreover, physical recombination of adult salispheres in a laminin-111 extracellular matrix with fetal salivary mesenchyme, containing endothelial and neuronal cells, only induced branching morphogenesis when neurturin, a neurotrophic factor, was added to the matrix. Neurturin was essential to improve neuronal survival, axon outgrowth, innervation of the salispheres, and resulted in the formation of branching structures with a proximal-distal axis that mimicked fetal branching morphogenesis, thus recapitulating organogenesis. Epithelial progenitors were also maintained, and developmental differentiation programs were initiated, showing that the fetal microenvironment provides a template for adult epithelial progenitors to initiate branching and differentiation. Further delineation of secreted and physical cues from the fetal niche will be useful to develop novel regenerative therapies that instruct adult salispheres to resume a developmental-like program in vitro and to regenerate branching organs in vivo.

22082467        	Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica: a further case without extracutaneous anomalies and review of the condition.            	Epidermal nevus syndrome is the term for the association of an epidermal nevus and extracutaneous anomalies, including neurologic, ophthalmic, and skeletal defects. Epidermal nevus syndromes include different disorders that share the feature of mosaicism. Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica (PPK) is a distinctive new epidermal nevus syndrome first described in 1996 characterized by the presence of multiple organoid nevi with sebaceous differentiation, a speckled lentiginous nevus, and skeletal and neurologic abnormalities. Only a handful of cases of PPK without extracutaneous manifestations have been reported. We report here an individual with PPK with only cutaneous signs and confirm this distinctive syndrome has two subtypes according to the presence or absence of extracutaneous involvement.                © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
31103627        	RNA-Binding Protein HuR Regulates Paneth Cell Function by Altering Membrane Localization of TLR2 via Post-transcriptional Control of CNPY3.            	Paneth cells secrete antimicrobial proteins including lysozyme via secretory autophagy as part of the mucosal protective response. The ELAV like RNA-binding protein 1 (ELAVL1, also called HuR) regulates stability and translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and many aspects of mucosal physiology. We studied the posttranscriptional mechanisms by which HuR regulates Paneth cell function.                Intestinal mucosal tissues were collected from mice with intestinal epithelium (IE)-specific disruption of HuR (IE-HuR-/-), HuRfl/fl-Cre- mice (controls), and patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Paneth cell functions were determined by lysozyme-immunostaining assays. We isolated primary enterocytes from IE-HuR-/- and control mice and derived intestinal organoids. HuR and the chaperone CNPY3 were overexpressed from transgenes in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or knocked down with small interfering RNAs. We performed RNA pulldown assays to investigate interactions between HuR and its target mRNAs.                Intestinal tissues from IE-HuR-/- mice had reduced numbers of Paneth cells, and Paneth cells had fewer lysozyme granules per cell, compared with tissues from control mice, but there were no effects on Goblet cells or enterocytes. Intestinal mucosa from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases had reduced levels of HuR and fewer Paneth cells. IE-HuR-/- mice did not have the apical distribution of TLR2 in the intestinal mucosa as observed in control mice. IECs from IE-HuR-/- mice expressed lower levels of CNPY3. Intestinal organoids from IE-HuR-/- mice were smaller and contained fewer buds compared with those generated from controls, and had fewer lysozyme-positive cells. In IECs, knockdown of HuR decreased levels of the autophagy proteins LC3-I and LC3-II, compared with control cells, and prevented rapamycin-induced autophagy. We found HuR to interact directly with the Cnpy3 mRNA coding region and increase levels of CNPY3 by increasing the stability and translation of Cnpy3 mRNA. CNPY3 bound TLR2, and cells with knockdown of CNPY3 or HuR lost membrane localization of TLR2, but increased cytoplasmic levels of TLR2.                In studies of mice, IECs, and human tissues, we found HuR to increase expression of CNPY3 at the posttranscriptional level. CNPY3 is required for membrane localization of TLR2 and Paneth cell function.                Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
29044933        	Cross-Tissue Identification of Somatic Stem and Progenitor Cells Using a Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Derived Gene Signature.            	A long-standing question in biology is whether multipotent somatic stem and progenitor cells (SSPCs) feature molecular properties that could guide their system-independent identification. Population-based transcriptomic studies have so far not been able to provide a definite answer, given the rarity and heterogeneous nature of these cells. Here, we exploited the resolving power of single-cell RNA-sequencing to develop a computational model that is able to accurately distinguish SSPCs from differentiated cells across tissues. The resulting classifier is based on the combined expression of 23 genes including known players in multipotency, proliferation, and tumorigenesis, as well as novel ones, such as Lcp1 and Vgll4 that we functionally validate in intestinal organoids. We show how this approach enables the identification of stem-like cells in still ambiguous systems such as the pancreas and the epidermis as well as the exploration of lineage commitment hierarchies, thus facilitating the study of biological processes such as cellular differentiation, tissue regeneration, and cancer.

22190642        	Cdx2 determines the fate of postnatal intestinal endoderm.            	Knock out of intestinal Cdx2 produces different effects depending upon the developmental stage at which this occurs. Early in development it produces histologically ordered stomach mucosa in the midgut. Conditional inactivation of Cdx2 in adult intestinal epithelium, as well as specifically in the Lgr5-positive stem cells, of adult mice allows long-term survival of the animals but fails to produce this phenotype. Instead, the endodermal cells exhibit cell-autonomous expression of gastric genes in an intestinal setting that is not accompanied by mesodermal expression of Barx1, which is necessary for gastric morphogenesis. Cdx2-negative endodermal cells also fail to express Sox2, a marker of gastric morphogenesis. Maturation of the stem cell niche thus appears to be associated with loss of ability to express positional information cues that are required for normal stomach development. Cdx2-negative intestinal crypts produce subsurface cystic vesicles, whereas untargeted crypts hypertrophy to later replace the surface epithelium. These observations are supported by studies involving inactivation of Cdx2 in intestinal crypts cultured in vitro. This abolishes their ability to form long-term growing intestinal organoids that differentiate into intestinal phenotypes. We conclude that expression of Cdx2 is essential for differentiation of gut stem cells into any of the intestinal cell types, but they maintain a degree of cell-autonomous plasticity that allows them to switch on a variety of gastric genes.	
28177577        	Award Winner in the Young Investigator Category, 2017 Society for Biomaterials Annual Meeting and Exposition, Minneapolis, MN, April 05-08, 2017: Lymph node stiffness-mimicking hydrogels regulate human B-cell lymphoma growth and cell surface receptor expression in a molecular subtype-specific manner.            	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with multiple molecular subtypes. The activated B-cell-like DLBCL subtype accounts for roughly one-third of all the cases and has an inferior prognosis. There is a need to develop better class of therapeutics that could target molecular pathways in resistant DLBCLs; however, this requires DLBCLs to be studied in representative tumor microenvironments. The pathogenesis and progression of lymphoma has been mostly studied from the point of view of genetic alterations and intracellular pathway dysregulation. By comparison, the importance of lymphoma microenvironment in which these malignant cells arise and reside has not been studied in as much detail. We have recently elucidated the role of integrin signaling in lymphomas and demonstrated that inhibition of integrin-ligand interactions abrogated the proliferation of malignant cells in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft. Here we demonstrate the role of lymph node tissue stiffness on DLBCL in a B-cell molecular subtype specific manner. We engineered tunable bioartificial hydrogels that mimicked the stiffness of healthy and neoplastic lymph nodes of a transgenic mouse model and primary human lymphoma tumors. Our results demonstrate that molecularly diverse DLBCLs grow differentially in soft and high stiffness microenvironments, which further modulates the integrin and B-cell receptor expression level as well as response to therapeutics. We anticipate that our findings will be broadly useful to study lymphoma biology and discover new class of therapeutics that target B-cell tumors in physical environments. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

31958521        	ATF2 and ATF7 Are Critical Mediators of Intestinal Epithelial Repair.            	Activation factor-1 transcription factor family members activating transcription factors 2 and 7 (ATF2 and ATF7) have highly redundant functions owing to highly homologous DNA binding sites. Their role in intestinal epithelial homeostasis and repair is unknown. Here, we assessed the role of these proteins in these conditions in an intestine-specific mouse model.                We performed in vivo and ex vivo experiments using Villin-CreERT2Atf2fl/flAtf7ko/ko mice. We investigated the effects of intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of the Atf2 DNA binding region in Atf7-/- mice on cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and epithelial barrier function under homeostatic conditions. Subsequently, we exposed mice to 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days and 12 Gy whole-body irradiation and assessed the response to epithelial damage.                Activating phosphorylation of ATF2 and ATF7 was detected mainly in the crypts of the small intestine and the lower crypt region of the colonic epithelium. Under homeostatic conditions, no major phenotypic changes were detectable in the intestine of ATF mutant mice. However, on DSS exposure or whole-body irradiation, the intestinal epithelium showed a clearly impaired regenerative response. Mutant mice developed severe ulceration and inflammation associated with increased epithelial apoptosis on DSS exposure and were less able to regenerate colonic crypts on irradiation. In vitro, organoids derived from double-mutant epithelium had a growth disadvantage compared with wild-type organoids, impaired wound healing capacity in scratch assay, and increased sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-α-induced damage.                ATF2 and ATF7 are dispensable for epithelial homeostasis, but are required to maintain epithelial regenerative capacity and protect against cell death during intestinal epithelial damage and repair.

We report a case of a 3-month old female infant, who presented with several thin plaques, with irregular borders, yellowish color, which had a verrucous appearance, following the lines of Blaschko, mainly occupying the left side of posterior trunk, the left face, the right side of the anterior trunk, and the right upper limb. These plaques had been present since birth. In addition, she had a flat salmon to yellow nevus on the left parietal and temporal region of the scalp, with a bald patch. She was diagnosed after birth with an interauricular communication. The skin biopsy from the lesion of the right arm revealed an epidermal nevus that occupied the epidermis completely. Routine and other complementary laboratory blood tests, including platelet count, thyroid function tests, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and plasma and urinary levels of calcium and phosphorus were negative. Cerebral magnetic resonance and renal ultrasound were normal. The diagnosis of SS was established. She is being followed in the clinics of Dermatology, Cardiology, Pediatrics, and Pediatric Neurology. We report this case to point out the importance of investigating patients with epidermal nevus to identify associated conditions.	
31919280        	Innate immune receptor NOD2 mediates LGR5+ intestinal stem cell protection against ROS cytotoxicity via mitophagy stimulation.            	The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) agonist muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria, supports leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5)+ intestinal stem cell (ISC) survival through NOD2 activation upon an otherwise lethal oxidative stress-mediated signal. However, the underlying protective mechanisms remain unknown. Here, using irradiation as stressor and primarily murine-derived intestinal organoids as a model system, we show that MDP induced a significant reduction of total and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) within ISCs, which was associated with mitophagy induction. ATG16L1 knockout (KO) and NOD2 KO organoids did not benefit from the MDP-induced cytoprotection. We confirmed the MDP-dependent induction of ISC mitophagy upon stress in vivo. These findings elucidate the NOD2-mediated mechanism of cytoprotection involving the clearance of the lethal excess of ROS molecules through mitophagy, triggered by the coordinated activation of NOD2 and ATG16L1 by a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-independent pathway.

28700940        	In Vitro Modeling Using Ciliopathy-Patient-Derived Cells Reveals Distinct Cilia Dysfunctions Caused by CEP290 Mutations.            	Mutations in CEP290, a transition zone protein in primary cilia, cause diverse ciliopathies, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and Joubert-syndrome and related disorders (JSRD). We examined cilia biogenesis and function in cells derived from CEP290-LCA and CEP290-JSRD patients. CEP290 protein was reduced in LCA fibroblasts with no detectable impact on cilia; however, optic cups derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of CEP290-LCA patients displayed less developed photoreceptor cilia. Lack of CEP290 in JSRD fibroblasts resulted in abnormal cilia and decreased ciliogenesis. We observed selectively reduced localization of ADCY3 and ARL13B. Notably, Hedgehog signaling was augmented in CEP290-JSRD because of enhanced ciliary transport of Smoothened and GPR161. These results demonstrate a direct correlation between the extent of ciliogenesis defects in fibroblasts and photoreceptors with phenotypic severity in JSRD and LCA, respectively, and strengthen the role of CEP290 as a selective ciliary gatekeeper for transport of signaling molecules in and out of the cilium.

33659924        	Targeting tumor resistance mechanisms.            	Cancer develops resistance to treatments through many mechanisms. Single-cell analyses reveal the intratumor heterogeneity and dynamic relationships between cancer cell subpopulations. These analyses also highlight that various mechanisms of resistance may coexist in a given tumor. Studies have unraveled how the microenvironment affects tumor response to treatments and how cancer cells may adapt to these treatments. Though challenging, individualized treatment based on the molecular characterization of the tumor should become the new standard of care. In the meantime, the success rate of clinical trials in oncology remains dramatically low. There is a need to do better and improve the predictability of preclinical models. This requires innovative changes in ex vivo models and the culture system currently being used. An innovative ligand design is also urgently needed. The limited arsenal of medicinal chemistry reactions and the biases of scaffold selection favor structurally similar compounds with linear shapes at the expense of disc and spherical shapes, which leave a large chemical shape space untouched. In this regard, venoms have received increasing interest as a wellspring for drug candidates. Overall, the characterization of tumor heterogeneity has contributed to advancing our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie cancer resistance to treatments. Targeting these mechanisms will require setting key milestones to significantly improve the translatability of preclinical studies to the clinic with the hope of increasing the success rate of clinical trials.

33208191        	High-throughput screening identifies histone deacetylase inhibitors that modulate GTF2I expression in 7q11.23 microduplication autism spectrum disorder patient-derived cortical neurons.            	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental condition affecting almost 1% of children, and represents a major unmet medical need with no effective drug treatment available. Duplication at 7q11.23 (7Dup), encompassing 26-28 genes, is one of the best characterized ASD-causing copy number variations and offers unique translational opportunities, because the hemideletion of the same interval causes Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a condition defined by hypersociability and language strengths, thereby providing a unique reference to validate treatments for the ASD symptoms. In the above-indicated interval at 7q11.23, defined as WBS critical region, several genes, such as GTF2I, BAZ1B, CLIP2 and EIF4H, emerged as critical for their role in the pathogenesis of WBS and 7Dup both from mouse models and human studies.                We performed a high-throughput screening of 1478 compounds, including central nervous system agents, epigenetic modulators and experimental substances, on patient-derived cortical glutamatergic neurons differentiated from our cohort of induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs), monitoring the transcriptional modulation of WBS interval genes, with a special focus on GTF2I, in light of its overriding pathogenic role. The hits identified were validated by measuring gene expression by qRT-PCR and the results were confirmed by western blotting.                We identified and selected three histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) that decreased the abnormal expression level of GTF2I in 7Dup cortical glutamatergic neurons differentiated from four genetically different iPSC lines. We confirmed this effect also at the protein level.                In this study, we did not address the molecular mechanisms whereby HDAC inhibitors act on GTF2I. The lead compounds identified will now need to be advanced to further testing in additional models, including patient-derived brain organoids and mouse models recapitulating the gene imbalances of the 7q11.23 microduplication, in order to validate their efficacy in rescuing phenotypes across multiple functional layers within a translational pipeline towards clinical use.                These results represent a unique opportunity for the development of a specific class of compounds for treating 7Dup and other forms of intellectual disability and autism.	
30017821        	The Zinc Finger Transcription Factor PLAGL2 Enhances Stem Cell Fate and Activates Expression of ASCL2 in Intestinal Epithelial Cells.            	Intestinal epithelial stem cell (IESC) fate is promoted by two major transcriptional regulators, the TCF4/β-catenin complex and ASCL2, which drive expression of IESC-specific factors, including Lgr5, Ephb2, and Rnf43. Canonical Wnt signaling via TCF4/β-catenin directly transactivates Ascl2, which in turn auto-regulates its own expression. Conversely, Let-7 microRNAs antagonize the IESC lineage by repressing specific mRNA targets. Here, we identify the zinc finger transcription factor PLAGL2 as a Let-7 target that regulates IESC fate. PLAGL2 drives an IESC expression signature, activates Wnt gene expression, and enhances a TCF/LEF reporter in intestinal organoids. In parallel, via cell-autonomous mechanisms, PLAGL2 is required for lineage clonal expansion and directly enhances expression of ASCL2. PLAGL2 also supports enteroid growth and survival in the context of Wnt ligand depletion. PLAGL2 expression is strongly associated with an IESC signature in colorectal cancer and may be responsible for contributing to the aberrant activation of an immature phenotype.

26534983        	Progress and renewal in gustation: new insights into taste bud development.            	The sense of taste, or gustation, is mediated by taste buds, which are housed in specialized taste papillae found in a stereotyped pattern on the surface of the tongue. Each bud, regardless of its location, is a collection of ∼100 cells that belong to at least five different functional classes, which transduce sweet, bitter, salt, sour and umami (the taste of glutamate) signals. Taste receptor cells harbor functional similarities to neurons but, like epithelial cells, are rapidly and continuously renewed throughout adult life. Here, I review recent advances in our understanding of how the pattern of taste buds is established in embryos and discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing taste cell turnover. I also highlight how these findings aid our understanding of how and why many cancer therapies result in taste dysfunction.                 © 2015. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.	
22843918        	hGH and GHR expression in large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the colon and rectum.            	Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is an aggressive neoplasm with a low frequency of occurrence in the digestive tract. We present a series of eight patients diagnosed with LCNEC of the colon and rectum. Grossly, tumors were presented as endophytic/ulcerative, annular and polypoid masses, with a gray-white color and necrosis in most cases. Histologically, they were high-grade tumors composed of large cells of organoid, nesting, trabecular, rosette-like and palisading patterns, with a high mitotic rate. Tumors were immunoreactive for neuroendocrine markers, including chromogranin A (2/8), synaptophysin (7/8), and neuron-specific enolase (8/8). Moreover, we analyzed the expression of growth hormone (hGH) and growth hormone receptor (GHR) in colorectal LCNECs and six tumors were immunoreactive for hGH, while five tumors were immunoreactive for GHR. To our knowledge hGH and GHR expression has not been previously analyzed in colorectal LCNEC. Their overexpression suggests a role of hGH and GHR in the development of colorectal LCNEC.	
29782142        	Projection-Based 3D Printing of Cell Patterning Scaffolds with Multiscale Channels.            	To fully actualize artificial, cell-laden biological models in tissue engineering, such as 3D organoids and organs-on-a-chip systems, cells need to be patterned such that they can precisely mimic natural microenvironments in vitro. Despite increasing interest in this area, patterning cells at multiscale (∼10 μm to 10 mm) remains a significant challenge in bioengineering. Here, we report a projection-based 3D printing system that achieves rapid and high-resolution fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds featuring intricate channels for multiscale cell patterning. Using this system, we were able to use biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate in fabricating a variety of scaffold architectures, ranging from regular geometries such as serpentine, spiral, and fractal-like to more irregular/intricate geometries, such as biomimetic arborescent and capillary networks. A red food dye solution was able to freely fill all channels in the scaffolds, from the trunk (>1100 μm in width) to the small branch (∼17 μm in width) without an external pump. The dimensions of the printed scaffolds remained stable over 3 days while being immersed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C, and a penetration analysis revealed that these scaffolds are suitable for metabolic and nutrient transport. Cell patterning experiments showed that red fluorescent protein-transfected A549 human nonsmall lung cancer cells adhered well in the scaffolds' channels, and showed further attachment and penetration during cell culture proliferation.	
27807451        	Lifespan Extension and Sustained Expression of Stem Cell Phenotype of Human Breast Epithelial Stem Cells in a Medium with Antioxidants.            	We have previously reported the isolation and culture of a human breast epithelial cell type with stem cell characteristics (Type I HBEC) from reduction mammoplasty using the MSU-1 medium. Subsequently, we have developed several different normal human adult stem cell types from different tissues using the K-NAC medium. In this study, we determined whether this low calcium K-NAC medium with antioxidants (N-acetyl-L-cysteine and L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate) is a better medium to grow human breast epithelial cells. The results clearly show that the K-NAC medium is a superior medium for prolonged growth (cumulative population doubling levels ranged from 30 to 40) of normal breast epithelial cells that expressed stem cell phenotypes. The characteristics of these mammary stem cells include deficiency in gap junctional intercellular communication, expression of Oct-4, and the ability to differentiate into basal epithelial cells and to form organoid showing mammary ductal and terminal end bud-like structures. Thus, this new method of growing Type I HBECs will be very useful in future studies of mammary development, breast carcinogenesis, chemoprevention, and cancer therapy.	
29849601        	Activation of Signal Transduction and Activator of Transcription 3 Signaling Contributes to Helicobacter-Associated Gastric Epithelial Proliferation and Inflammation.            	Although IL-6-mediated activation of the signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) axis is involved in inflammation and cancer, the role of STAT3 in Helicobacter-associated gastric inflammation and carcinogenesis is unclear. This study investigated the role of STAT3 in gastric inflammation and carcinogenesis and examined the molecular mechanism of Helicobacter-induced gastric phenotypes.                To evaluate the contribution of STAT3 to gastric inflammation and carcinogenesis, we used wild-type (WT) and gastric epithelial conditional Stat3-knockout (Stat3Δgec ) mice. Mice were infected with Helicobacter felis and euthanized at 18 months postinfection. Mouse gastric organoids were treated with recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) or rIL-11 and a JAK inhibitor (JAKi) to assess the role of IL-6/STAT3 signaling in vitro.                Inflammation and mucous metaplasia were more severe in WT mice than in Stat3Δgec mice. The epithelial cell proliferation rate and STAT3 activation were increased in WT mice. Application of rIL-6 and rIL-11 induced expression of intestinal metaplasia-associated genes, such as Tff2; this induction was suppressed by JAKi administration.                Loss of STAT3 signaling in the gastric mucosa leads to decreased epithelial cell proliferation, atrophy, and metaplasia in the setting of Helicobacter infection. Therefore, activation of STAT3 signaling may play a key role in Helicobacter-associated gastric carcinogenesis.	
33128895        	Human Lung Stem Cell-Based Alveolospheres Provide Insights into SARS-CoV-2-Mediated Interferon Responses and Pneumocyte Dysfunction.            	Coronavirus infection causes diffuse alveolar damage leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The absence of ex vivo models of human alveolar epithelium is hindering an understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. Here, we report a feeder-free, scalable, chemically defined, and modular alveolosphere culture system for the propagation and differentiation of human alveolar type 2 cells/pneumocytes derived from primary lung tissue. Cultured pneumocytes express the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor type-2 (ACE2) and can be infected with virus. Transcriptome and histological analysis of infected alveolospheres mirror features of COVID-19 lungs, including emergence of interferon (IFN)-mediated inflammatory responses, loss of surfactant proteins, and apoptosis. Treatment of alveolospheres with IFNs recapitulates features of virus infection, including cell death. In contrast, alveolospheres pretreated with low-dose IFNs show a reduction in viral replication, suggesting the prophylactic effectiveness of IFNs against SARS-CoV-2. Human stem cell-based alveolospheres, thus, provide novel insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis and can serve as a model for understanding human respiratory diseases.

22716059        	Mediastinal ganglioneuroma with perineural cell differentiation. Report of a case.            	An unusual case of ganglioneuroma with perineural cell differentiation is presented. The tumor was removed from the mediastinum in a 34-year-old male patient. Histologically, it contained neuroid bundles of bland spindle cells, scattered ganglion cells, and some foci of adipocytic metaplasia. Immunohistochemically, the tumor showed expected expressions of S100 protein, neurofilament protein and calretinin. In addition, many spindle cells were positive for perineural cell markers EMA, claudin-1, and GLUT-1. These cells were often arranged in an organoid fashion around the schwannoid bundles. This case indicates that the cells of ganglioneuroma can mature simultaneously towards both Schwann cell and perineural cell phenotypes.	
21552147        	ASPS-1, a novel cell line manifesting key features of alveolar soft part sarcoma.            	In vitro growth of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and establishment of an ASPS cell line, ASPS-1, are described in this study. Using a recently developed xenograft model of ASPS derived from a lymph node metastasis, organoid nests consisting of 15 to 25 ASPS cells were isolated from ASPS xenograft tumors by capture on 70 μm filters and plated in vitro. After attachment to the substratum, these nests deposited small aggregates of ASPS cells. These cells grew slowly and were expanded over a period of 3 years and have maintained characteristics consistent with those of both the original ASPS tumor from the patient and the xenograft tumor including (1) presence of the alveolar soft part locus-transcription factor E3 type 1 fusion transcript and nuclear expression of the alveolar soft part locus-transcription factor E3 type 1 fusion protein; (2) maintenance of the t(X;17)(p11;q25) translocation characteristic of ASPS; and (3) expression of upregulated ASPS transcripts involved in angiogenesis (ANGPTL2, HIF-1-α, MDK, c-MET, VEGF, and TIMP-2), cell proliferation (PRL, PCSK1), metastasis (ADAM9), as well as the transcription factor BHLHB3 and the muscle-specific transcripts TRIM63 and ITGβ1BP3. This ASPS cell line forms colonies in soft agar and retains the ability to produce highly vascularized ASPS tumors in NOD.SCID/NCr mice. Immunohistochemistry of selected ASPS markers on these tumors indicated similarity to those of the original patient tumor as well as to the xenografted ASPS tumor. We anticipate that this ASPS cell line will accelerate investigations into the biology of ASPS including identification of new therapeutic approaches for treatment of this slow growing soft tissue sarcoma.	
21239196        	Oncocytoma of the kidney with prominent intracytoplasmic lumina.            	Oncocytoma is a histologically distinctive neoplasm of the kidney, with a well-recognized cytoarchitectural appearance. On occasion, however, renal oncocytomas are known to exhibit unusual morphologic features that may pose diagnostic difficulties. We present the clinical and pathologic details of an oncocytoma of the kidney with an unusual histologic appearance imparted by the presence of large numbers of prominent intracytoplasmic lumens. Morphologically, the neoplasm was composed of uniform polygonal cells with copious amounts of granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm, round nuclei, and prominent nucleoli, exhibiting an organoid pattern of growth. Intracytoplasmic lumina of varying size were present throughout the tumor. There were no mitotic figures or areas of necrosis present. The diagnosis of oncocytoma was supported by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies. By electron microscopy, the intracytoplasmic lumens appeared as membrane bound spaces with associated microvilli. The presence of intracytoplasmic lumina in a significant proportion of cells is an uncommon feature of renal oncocytoma which can generate problems in diagnosis. Awareness of this phenomenon should allow for improved recognition of oncocytomas exhibiting this type of unusual morphology.                Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
33227588        	Behavior and lineage progression of neural progenitors in the mammalian cortex.            	The cerebral cortex is a central structure in the mammalian brain that enables higher cognitive functions and intellectual skills. It is the hallmark of the mammalian nervous system with enormous complexity, consisting of a large number of neurons and glia that are diverse in morphology, molecular expression, biophysical properties, circuit connectivity and physiological function. Cortical neurons and glia are generated by neural progenitor cells during development. Ensuring the correct cell cycle kinetics, fate behavior and lineage progression of neural progenitor cells is essential to determine the number and types of neurons and glia in the cerebral cortex, which together constitute neural circuits for brain function. In this review, we discuss recent findings on mammalian cortical progenitor cell types and their lineage behaviors in generating neurons and glia, cortical evolution and expansion, and advances in brain organoid technology that allow the modeling of human cortical development under normal and disease conditions.

33147486        	Mitochondria Define Intestinal Stem Cell Differentiation Downstream of a FOXO/Notch Axis.            	Differential WNT and Notch signaling regulates differentiation of Lgr5+ crypt-based columnar cells (CBCs) into intestinal cell lineages. Recently we showed that mitochondrial activity supports CBCs, while adjacent Paneth cells (PCs) show reduced mitochondrial activity. This implies that CBC differentiation into PCs involves a metabolic transition toward downregulation of mitochondrial dependency. Here we show that Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors and Notch signaling interact in determining CBC fate. In agreement with the organoid data, Foxo1/3/4 deletion in mouse intestine induces secretory cell differentiation. Importantly, we show that FOXO and Notch signaling converge on regulation of mitochondrial fission, which in turn provokes stem cell differentiation into goblet cells and PCs. Finally, scRNA-seq-based reconstruction of CBC differentiation trajectories supports the role of FOXO, Notch, and mitochondria in secretory differentiation. Together, this points at a new signaling-metabolic axis in CBC differentiation and highlights the importance of mitochondria in determining stem cell fate.

21254456        	Cytological, histological, and immunohistochemical findings of pulmonary carcinomas with basaloid features.            	Pulmonary basaloid carcinoma (BC), a variant of large cell, nonsmall cell carcinoma (NSCC), and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSQCC) can show features similar to small cell carcinoma (SCC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). Distinction from SCC, especially on FNA, is therapeutically relevant. We describe cytological, histological, and immunohistochemical features of BC and BSQCC. Numerous cytologic features were documented in cytologic preparations. Similar features and architecture were evaluated in the resections. Immunohistochemical results were recorded. Histologically confirmed BC (n = 3) and BSQCC (n = 3) were included. Five FNAs of SCC, (four with histologic follow-up) were studied for comparison of cytological, histological, and immunohistochemical findings. In cytologic preparations of BC/BSQCC, cells were arranged mostly as tightly cohesive clusters (n = 4) or singly and in clusters (n = 2) with a predominance of clusters. Cytologic features of BC and BSQCC were similar: palisading (n = 6), crush artifact (n = 6), hyperchromasia (n = 5), focal nuclear molding (n = 6; very rare in 2/6), nucleoli, usually pinpoint (n = 3), scant cytoplasm (n = 6), necrosis (n = 5), apoptosis (n = 4), squamous differentiation (n = 1). BSQCC tended to have occasional larger cells, including keratinizing cells in one case. Histologic sections (n = 6) showed neuroendocrine features, including organoid arrangements, nests, and palisading. BC and BSQCC show overlapping features with SCC and LCNEC in cytological and histological specimens. Unlike SCCs, BC/BSQCC lack prominent nuclear molding, show tightly cohesive cell clusters, and demonstrate palisading. However, immunostains were the very helpful and probably necessary to accurately diagnosing BC/BSQCC, which show the immunostaining pattern of p63 (+), HMWCK (+), and TTF-1 (-).

32784124        	Modeling oncogenic herpesvirus infections in humanized mice.            	The creation of humanized mice generally involves the reconstitution of immunodeficient mice with human immune constituents. Different methodologies have been employed, and significant progress has been made towards the development of robustly humanized mouse models. Some of the techniques used include the injection of mature human immune cells, the injection of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) capable of reconstituting radiation-depleted murine bone marrow, and the implantation of human fetal liver and thymus fragments under the kidney capsule to create a thymic organoid that can support thympoiesis. This review will serve as a brief introduction to the three most commonly utilized humanized mouse models for the study of gammaherpesvirus-driven pathogenesis, and highlight some of the critical discoveries these models have enabled.

29887318        	Paneth Cell Multipotency Induced by Notch Activation following Injury.            	Paneth cells are post-mitotic intestinal epithelial cells supporting the stem cell niche and mucosal immunity. Paneth cell pathologies are observed in various gastrointestinal diseases, but their plasticity and response to genomic and environmental challenges remain unclear. Using a knockin allele engineered at the mouse Lyz1 locus, we performed detailed Paneth cell-lineage tracing. Irradiation induced a subset of Paneth cells to proliferate and differentiate into villus epithelial cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that Paneth cells sorted from irradiated mice acquired a stem cell-like transcriptome; when cultured in vitro, these individual Paneth cells formed organoids. Irradiation activated Notch signaling, and forced expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in Paneth cells, but not Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, induced their dedifferentiation. This study documents Paneth cell plasticity, particularly their ability to participate in epithelial replenishment following stem cell loss, adding to a growing body of knowledge detailing the molecular pathways controlling injury-induced regeneration.

29436278        	Assessing the Impact of Targeting CEACAM1 in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.            	Objective In conjunction with advances made in cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, immunotherapy has emerged as a fourth modality of treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Understanding the mechanisms by which HNSCC evades immune-mediated control will aid in the development of new therapies to augment an antitumor immune response. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a cell surface receptor that is expressed on malignant cells and lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells. We sought to determine whether tumor-derived CEACAM1 inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity and whether blockade of CEACAM1 restores antitumor immunity. Study Design In vitro HNSCC cell line study. Setting Research laboratory. Subject and Methods We utilized a real-time cell analyzer to assess NK cell cytotoxicity against an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line after modulating CEACAM1 expression by cytokines and shRNA knockdown of CEACAM1 expression. Results NK cells and HNSCC cells both demonstrated cytokine-inducible expression of CEACAM1. Coincubation of NK cells and HNSCC cells resulted in the upregulation of CEACAM1 on the tumor cells. When compared with CEACAM1- cells, CEACAM1+ tumor cells exhibited increased cell growth and increased size and number of organoids in 3-dimensional culture. Notably, CEACAM1+ HNSCC cells were more resistant to NK cell-mediated killing, but the inhibited expression of CEACAM1 by an shRNA construct restored NK cell cytotoxicity. Conclusion Together, these data indicate that CEACAM1 acts as an inducible checkpoint molecule, and they support the idea that targeting CEACAM1 could serve as a novel immunotherapy approach in HNSCC.	
33262196        	High-affinity neoantigens correlate with better prognosis and trigger potent antihepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) activity by activating CD39+CD8+ T cells.            	It remains controversial whether tumour mutational burden (TMB) or neoantigens are prognostic markers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to define the function of TMB or neoantigens in antitumour immunotherapy.                Neoantigens of patients (n=56) were analysed by pVAC tools with major histocompatibility complex-1 (MHC-I) algorithms based on whole exome sequencing and neoantigens with mutant type IC50 <50 nM were defined as high-affinity neoantigens (HANs). Patients were segregated into HAN-high/low groups by median of HAN value, and overall survival (OS) was analysed. Autologous organoid killing model was developed to clarify the antitumour activity of HANs.                The value of HAN showed a better correlation with OS (p=0.0199) than TMB (p=0.7505) or neoantigens (p=0.2297) in patients with HCC and positively correlated with the frequency of CD39+CD8+ tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Furthermore, HAN-specific CD8+ T cells were identified in CD39+CD8+ TILs, which showed better antitumour activity in HAN-high versus HAN-low group. In addition, more effective HAN peptides were identified in HAN-high versus HAN-low group. Besides, flow cytometry data showed that in fresh tumour, CD39+PD-1intCD8+ TILs displayed an effector phenotype and stronger antitumour activity in HAN-high versus HAN-low group. More importantly, patients in HAN-high versus HAN-low group showed a better prognosis after anti-PD-1 therapy.                Our study first demonstrates that HAN value positively correlates with better OS in patients with HCC. HANs trigger antitumour activity by activating tumour-reactive CD39+CD8+ T cells, and patients in HAN-high group benefited more from anti-PD-1 therapy than HAN-low group. These findings may provide a novel strategy for personalised antitumour therapies for HCC.                © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

33112800        	Advances in paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma cell lines and xenografts.            	This review describes human and rodent-derived cell lines and xenografts developed over the last five decades that are suitable or potentially suitable models for paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma research. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of various models and emphasize the recurring theme that, despite the major challenges involved, more effort is required in the search for valid human and animal cell models of paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma, particularly those relevant to cancers carrying a mutation in one of the succinate dehydrogenase genes. Despite many setbacks, the recent development of a potentially important new model, the RS0 cell line, gives reason for optimism regarding the future of models in the paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma field. We also note that classic approaches to cell line derivation such as SV40-mediated immortalization and newer approaches such as organoid culture or iPSCs have been insufficiently explored. As many existing cell lines have been poorly characterized, we provide recommendations for reporting of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma cell lines, including the strong recommendation that cell lines are made widely available via the ATCC or a similar cell repository. Basic research in paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma is currently transitioning from the analysis of genetics to the analysis of disease mechanisms and the clinically exploitable vulnerabilities of tumors. A successful transition will require many more disease-relevant human and animal models to ensure continuing progress.	
32348708        	Microphysiological Modeling of the Human Endometrium.            	Since the beginning of clinical medicine, the human uterus has held the fascination of clinicians and researchers, given its critical role in the reproduction of our species. The endometrial lining provides residence for the embryo; however, this symbiotic interaction can be disrupted if the timing is not correct and the endometrium is not receptive. Diseases associated with the endometrium interfere with the reproductive process and cause a life-altering burden of pain and even death. With the advancement of technologies and new insights into the biology of the endometrium, much has been uncovered about the dynamic and essential changes that need to occur for normal endometrial function, as well as aberrations that lead to endometrial diseases. As expected, the more that is uncovered, the more the complexity of the endometrium is made evident. In this study, we bring together three areas of scientific advancement that remain in their infancy, but which together have the potential to mirror this complexity and enable understanding. Studies on induced pluripotent stem cells, three-dimensional tissue mimics, and microfluidic culture platforms will be reviewed with a focus on the endometrium. These unconventional approaches will provide new perspectives and appreciation for the elegance and complexity of the endometrium. Impact statement The ability of the human endometrium to regenerate on a monthly basis for ∼4 decades of reproductive years exemplifies its complexity as well as its susceptibility to disease. Restrictions on the types of research that can be done in the human endometrium motivate the development of new technologies and model systems. The three areas of technological advancement reviewed here-induced pluripotent stem cells, three-dimensional model systems, and microfluidic culture systems-will highlight some of the tools that can be applied to studying the human endometrium in ways that have not been done before.	
25264534        	A 6-year-old girl with vaginal spotting who was diagnosed with perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasm after vaginoscopic resection.            	Perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasm (PEComa) is a rare tumor with unknown malignant potential. We report a case of a 6-year-old child with history of brain tumor (pineoblastoma), who presented with intermittent vaginal spotting for 6 months. A vaginoscopy revealed a 1.5×1.0-cm mass on the vaginal wall. Pathological examination demonstrated that the tumor was composed of clear cells with organoid patterns, which were immunohistochemically positive for HMB-45 and TFE3, and negative for CK, HNF1-B, SOX10, Melan A, and S-100 protein. These findings were consistent with PEComa arising from the vagina. Regular follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging has shown no signs of recurrence. This case shows that early detection of PEComa and subsequent regular follow-ups are important because of the neoplasm's unknown malignant potential.	
23358633        	Role of CEACAM1 and CEACAM20 in an in vitro model of prostate morphogenesis.            	CEACAM20, a novel member of the CEACAM1 gene family with expression limited to the lumen of small intestine, testes, and prostate, is co-expressed with CEACAM1 in adult prostate tissue and down-regulated to the same extent as CEACAM1 in prostate cancer. Since prostate cancer often involves loss of epithelial lumen formation, we hypothesized that CEACAM20 and CEACAM1 play important roles in lumen formation of normal prostate epithelium. When prostate cells were grown on Matrigel as a source of extracellular matrix (ECM), they differentiated into acinar structures with single tubules and well-defined lumina closely resembling embryonic prostate organoids. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed restriction of CEACAM20 to acini and CEACAM1 to tubule structures, respectively. Inhibition of CEACAM1 with antibodies or soluble CEACAM1 or antisense oligonucleotides inhibited tubule formation by over 50% while the remaining tubules were stunted. Inhibition of CEACAM20 with antisense oligonucleotides completely inhibited tubule formation and stunted the growth of acini. We conclude that CEACAM20 and CEACAM1 not only mark the lumina of adult prostate tissue but also play a critical role in the vitro generation of prostate organoids.	
25316401        	A case report of rare Ovarian Neuroendocrine carcinoma.            	Historically misunderstood to be rare and relatively benign, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are increasingly common and are now regarded as malignant neoplasms that can cause debilitating symptoms and potentially life threatening issues for patients. Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of separate clinico-pathological entities that share a common characteristic i.e. expression of endocrine differentiation potential. In the ovary, the term "neuroendocrine" relates mainly to widely-known carcinoids, but it may also be applied to neuroendocrine carcinomas of nonsmall- cell type and small cell carcinomas of pulmonary type. Ovarian carcinoids develop in pure form or in association with other tumors, mainly teratomas. They originate from endocrine cells, either of teratomatous origin or possibly also indigeneous. Ovarian neuroendocrine carcinomas belong most probably to surface epithelial neoplasms, which express endocrine pathway of differentiation. The neuroendocrine carcinomas of non-smallcell type are characterized by the presence of islands, sheets, and trabeculae with little intervening stroma (organoid growth pattern) and cellular homogeneity. However, they are higher-grade than carcinoids. Primary ovarian small cell carcinomas of the pulmonary type do not differ histologically from their counterparts in other organs. They are composed of small cells with scanty cytoplasm and oval to spindleshaped nuclei.	
33187835        	Integrin-mediated adhesion and mechanosensing in the mammary gland.            	The mammary gland is dynamically remodelled during its postnatal development and the reproductive cycles. This inherent plasticity has been suggested to increase the susceptibility of the organ to carcinogenesis. Morphological changes in the mammary epithelium involve cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration which, in turn, are affected by cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors function in the sensing of the biochemical composition, patterning and mechanical properties of the ECM surrounding the cells, and strongly influence cell fate. This review aims to summarize the existing literature on how different aspects of integrin-mediated adhesion and mechanosensing, including ECM composition; stiffness and topography; integrin expression patterns; focal adhesion assembly; dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton; and nuclear mechanotransduction affect mammary gland development, function and homeostasis. As the mechanical properties of a complex tissue environment are challenging to replicate in vitro, emphasis has been placed on studies conducted in vivo or using organoid models. Outright, these studies indicate that mechanosensing also contributes to the regulation of mammary gland morphogenesis in multiple ways.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

22146529        	A case of retroperitoneal immature teratoma with nephroblastic components.            	The presence of nephroblastic components is extremely rare in retroperitoneal teratomas. We described an unusual case of right retroperitoneal immature teratoma with nephroblastic components in a 2-month-old Japanese girl. Approximately 15% of tumor was composed of nephroblastic components within immature teratoma components. Although overlap of histopathological findings between teratomas with nephroblastic components and teratoid Wilms tumors, which have heterologous elements in >50% of the tumor, occasionally exist, the most distinct feature of teratoma is the presence of organoid arrangement. The prognosis of retroperitoneal teratomas with nephroblastic components has not yet been established, therefore, additional case studies are needed.	
33142114        	BMP10 Signaling Promotes the Development of Endocardial Cells from Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiovascular Progenitors.            	The embryonic endocardium is essential for early heart development as it functions to induce trabecular myocardium, the first heart tissue to form, and is the source of the cells that make up the valves and a portion of the coronary vasculature. With this potential, human endocardial cells could provide unique therapeutic opportunities that include engineering biological valves and cell-based therapy strategies to replace coronary vasculature in damaged hearts. To access human endocardial cells, we generated a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived endothelial population that displays many characteristics of endocardium, including expression of the cohort of genes that identifies this lineage in vivo, the capacity to induce a trabecular fate in immature cardiomyocytes in vitro, and the ability to undergo an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

28812582        	Control of intestinal stem cell function and proliferation by mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism.            	Most differentiated cells convert glucose to pyruvate in the cytosol through glycolysis, followed by pyruvate oxidation in the mitochondria. These processes are linked by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), which is required for efficient mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. In contrast, proliferative cells, including many cancer and stem cells, perform glycolysis robustly but limit fractional mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation. We sought to understand the role this transition from glycolysis to pyruvate oxidation plays in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Loss of the MPC in Lgr5-EGFP-positive stem cells, or treatment of intestinal organoids with an MPC inhibitor, increases proliferation and expands the stem cell compartment. Similarly, genetic deletion of the MPC in Drosophila intestinal stem cells also increases proliferation, whereas MPC overexpression suppresses stem cell proliferation. These data demonstrate that limiting mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is necessary and sufficient to maintain the proliferation of intestinal stem cells.	
21493041        	Primary typical carcinoid tumour in the retromolar region with prominent squamous differentiation: a case report.            	Primary carcinoid tumours of the oral cavity are rare, with only one case of atypical carcinoid tumour reported in the literature. In this article, a case of primary typical carcinoid tumour in the retromolar region in a 46-year-old woman is described. Histologically, the tumour was characterized by submucosal proliferation of medium-sized monomorphous epithelioid cells with an organoid and nesting pattern of growth. Mitoses and necrosis were not found. Prominent squamous differentiation was present. Immunohistochemically, the tumour was diffuse positive for cytokeratin (CK) (AE1/AE3), CK7, p63, neurone-specific enolase, synaptophysin, and chromogranin. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of primary typical carcinoid tumour in the oral cavity.

33027665        	Parallel Single-Cell RNA-Seq and Genetic Recording Reveals Lineage Decisions in Developing Embryoid Bodies.            	Early developmental specification can be modeled by differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to embryoid bodies (EBs), a heterogeneous mixture of three germ layers. Here, we combine single-cell transcriptomics and genetic recording to characterize EB differentiation. We map transcriptional states along a time course and model cell fate trajectories and branchpoints as cells progress to distinct germ layers. To validate this inferential model, we propose an innovative inducible genetic recording technique that leverages recombination to generate cell-specific, timestamp barcodes in a narrow temporal window. We validate trajectory architecture and key branchpoints, including early specification of a primordial germ cell (PGC)-like lineage from preimplantation epiblast-like cells. We further identify a temporally defined role of DNA methylation in this PGC-epiblast decision. Our study provides a high-resolution lineage map for an organoid model of embryogenesis, insights into epigenetic determinants of fate specification, and a strategy for lineage mapping of rapid differentiation processes.

32488621        	Morphologic Variants of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: Clinicopathologic Analysis and Prognostic Stratification.            	Better prognostication/stratification of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) is needed. In this detailed morpheomic study of 163 resected PanNETs, 11 unusual variants, some of which were not previously recognized, and others scarcely documented in the literature, were identified, and their pathologic characteristics were further analyzed. By behavior and clinicopathologic associations, these variants could be grouped into three prognostically different categories. I. More aggressive (20%). Included in this group were the variants that in average showed higher grade and stage and adverse outcome including oncocytic, plasmacytoid, lipid-rich and previously unrecognized hepatoid variants, which often had a more diffuse/broad-band growth pattern, with some also displaying discohesiveness. They were characterized by abundant cytoplasm and often had prominent nucleoli (as seen in metabolically active cells), thus the provisional name "metabolic cell phenotype." Because of their diversion from classical neuroendocrine cytomorphology, these variants created challenges on original diagnostic workup, particularly hepatoid examples, which revealed Arginase 1/Hep Par-1 expression in 50%. II. Less aggressive (10%). These cases either showed signs of maturation, including nested growth, paraganglioid pattern (which was previously unrecognized), and organoid PanNETs such as "ductulo-insular" growth, or showed symplastic/degenerative changes, and despite their paradoxically disconcerting histology, were more benevolent in behavior. III. Undetermined. There were other variants including mammary tubulolobular-like, pseudoglandular, peliotic, and sclerotic PanNETs, which although diagnostically challenging, their biologic significance could not be determined because of rarity or heterogeneous characteristics. Prognostic associations: Features that were significantly different in the more aggressive group than the less aggressive group were median size (5.0 vs 1.6 cm, p < 0.001), percentage of pT3+T4 cases (72% vs 12%, p < 0.001), Ki67 index (5.3% vs 2.3%, p = 0.001), % G2 and G3 cases (77% vs 27%, p < 0.001), and rate of lymph node and distant metastasis (96% vs 27%, p < 0.001). In stepwise logistic regression model using the 3 established prognosticators of T stage, size, and grade along with morphology, only aggressive-morphology (metabolic cell phenotype) was found to be associated with metastatic behavior with an odds ratio of 5.9 with 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.688 to 22.945 and p value 0.007. In conclusion, PanNETs display various morphologic patterns that are not only challenging and important diagnostically but appear to have biologic significance. Tumors with more diffuse growth of cells with nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm and/or discohesion (oncocytic, hepatoid, lipid-rich, plasmacytoid PanNETs), provisionally termed "metabolic cell phenotype," show aggressive characteristics and are an independent determinant of adverse outcome and thus may require closer post-surgical follow-up, whereas variants with more degenerative or mature features (ductuloinsular, pleomorphic, paraganglioma-like) appear to be more benevolent despite their more atypical and worrisome morphology.	
25660024        	Repression of Intestinal Stem Cell Function and Tumorigenesis through Direct Phosphorylation of β-Catenin and Yap by PKCζ.            	Intestinal epithelial homeostasis requires continuous renewal supported by stem cells located in the base of the crypt. Disruption of this balance results in failure to regenerate and initiates tumorigenesis. The β-catenin and Yap pathways in Lgr5+ stem cells have been shown to be central to this process. However, the precise mechanisms by which these signaling molecules are regulated in the stem cell population are not totally understood. Protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) has been previously demonstrated to be a negative regulator of intestinal tumorigenesis. Here, we show that PKCζ suppresses intestinal stem cell function by promoting the downregulation of β-catenin and Yap through direct phosphorylation. PKCζ deficiency results in increased stem cell activity in organoid cultures and in vivo, accounting for the increased tumorigenic and regenerative activity response of Lgr5+-specific PKCζ-deficient mice. This demonstrates that PKCζ is central to the control of stem cells in intestinal cancer and homeostasis.                Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
31476530        	Mesoderm specification and diversification: from single cells to emergent tissues.            	The three germ layers - mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm - constituting the cellular blueprint for the tissues and organs that will form during embryonic development, are specified at gastrulation. Cells of mesodermal origin are the most abundant in the human body, representing a great variety of cell types, including the musculoskeletal system (bone, cartilage and muscle), cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), as well as the connective tissues found throughout our bodies. A long-standing question pertains how this panoply of mesodermal cell types arises in a stereotypical fashion in time and space. This review discusses the events associated with mesoderm specification, highlighting the reconstruction of putative developmental trajectories facilitated by recent single-cell 'omic' data. We will also discuss the potential of emergent organoid systems to emulate and interrogate the dynamics of lineage specification at cellular resolution.                Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

33418078        	Identification of HIF-dependent alternative splicing in gastrointestinal cancers and characterization of a long, coding isoform of SLC35A3.            	Intra-tumor hypoxia is a common feature in many solid cancers. Although transcriptional targets of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) have been well characterized, alternative splicing or processing of pre-mRNA transcripts which occurs during hypoxia and subsequent HIF stabilization is much less understood. Here, we identify many HIF-dependent alternative splicing events after whole transcriptome sequencing in pancreatic cancer cells exposed to hypoxia with and without downregulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), a protein required for HIFs to form a transcriptionally active dimer. We correlate the discovered hypoxia-driven events with available sequencing data from pan-cancer TCGA patient cohorts to select a narrow set of putative biologically relevant splice events for experimental validation. We validate a small set of candidate HIF-dependent alternative splicing events in multiple human gastrointestinal cancer cell lines as well as patient-derived human pancreatic cancer organoids. Lastly, we report the discovery of a HIF-dependent mechanism to produce a hypoxia-dependent, long and coding isoform of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter SLC35A3.

32669421        	STING differentially regulates experimental GVHD mediated by CD8 versus CD4 T cell subsets.            	The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has been proposed as a key regulator of gastrointestinal homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Although STING reportedly protects against gut barrier damage and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), its effect in clinically relevant MHC-matched aHSCT is unknown. Studies here demonstrate that STING signaling in nonhematopoietic cells promoted MHC-matched aHSCT-induced GVHD and that STING agonists increased type I interferon and MHC I expression in nonhematopoietic mouse intestinal organoid cultures. Moreover, mice expressing a human STING allele containing three single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with decreased STING activity also developed reduced MHC-matched GVHD, demonstrating STING's potential clinical importance. STING-/- recipients experienced reduced GVHD with transplant of purified donor CD8+ T cells in both MHC-matched and MHC-mismatched models, reconciling the seemingly disparate results. Further examination revealed that STING deficiency reduced the activation of donor CD8+ T cells early after transplant and promoted recipient MHC class II+ antigen-presenting cell (APC) survival. Therefore, APC persistence in STING pathway absence may account for the increased GVHD mediated by CD4+ T cells in completely mismatched recipients. In total, our findings have important implications for regulating clinical GVHD by targeting STING early after aHSCT and demonstrate that an innate immune pathway has opposing effects on the outcome of aHSCT, depending on the donor/recipient MHC disparity.

21914158        	Syringocystadenoma papilliferum on the male nipple.            	Syringocystadenoma papilliferum is a rare benign adnexal tumor that most frequently arises from an organoid nevus on the head and neck. Occurrence of this tumor on the male breast is extremely rare. A 74-year-old Japanese man presented with a nodule on his left nipple. Histopathological findings were typical for syringocystadenoma papilliferum. Ultrastructurally, constituent epithelial cells of the tumor were divided into three types. We focused on one cell type, undifferentiated clear cells, which have been suggested to be pluripotent cells bearing stem cell nature in syringocystadenoma papilliferum. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were negative for cytokeratin 15, which is known as a relatively specific marker for multipotent stem cells in the follicular bulge. We speculated that the clear cells are slightly differentiated toward apocrine rather than stem cells. We also ruled out the possibility of a relationship between the clear cells and Toker cells, which have a clear cytoplasm and are present in the areola region. Dermoscopic examination revealed amorphous milky white areas that corresponded to the pathological findings of luminal deposition of the tumor.                © 2011 Japanese Dermatological Association.	
21277344        	De novo formation and ultra-structural characterization of a fiber-producing human hair follicle equivalent in vitro.            	Across many tissues and organs, the ability to create an organoid, the smallest functional unit of an organ, in vitro is the key both to tissue engineering and preclinical testing regimes. The hair follicle is an organoid that has been much studied based on its ability to grow quickly and to regenerate after trauma. But hair follicle formation in vitro has been elusive. Replacing hair lost due to pattern baldness or more severe alopecia, including that induced by chemotherapy, remains a significant unmet medical need. By carefully analyzing and recapitulating the growth conditions of hair follicle formation, we recreated human hair follicles in tissue culture that were capable of producing hair. Our microfollicles contained all relevant cell types and their structure and orientation resembled in some ways excised hair follicle specimens from human skin. This finding offers a new window onto hair follicle development. Having a robust culture system for hair follicles is an important step towards improved hair regeneration as well as to an understanding of how marketed drugs or drug candidates, including cancer chemotherapy, will affect this important organ.

22897071        	Hyperthyroidism as a clinical manifestation of a embryonal carcinoma of the testis.            	This case report describes a case of hyperthyroidism as manifestation of an embryonal carcinoma, and illustrates the causes that led to it. The case describes a 33-year-old male patient who complained of chest pain, palpitations, mild dyspnoea, and weight loss. Blood analysis reveals high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (833818 mlU/ml), T3 (16.90 pg/ml), and T4 (7.77 ng/dl), as well as a fall of TSH (0.01 ulU/ml). Physical examination and imaging procedures confirm the occurrence of a left testicular tumour associated with numerous lung, hepatic and retroperitoneal metastases. Treatment with carbimazol and propanolol is established to manage hyperthyroidism, and an urgent orchiectomy is performed; the histologic diagnosis confirms an embryonal carcinoma (organoid type), but the patient died unexpectedly 24 hours later after having suffered sudden dyspnoea, tachypnoea, and tachyarrhythmia. Hyperthyroidism is a rare manifestation of a testicular tumour that should be borne in mind with regard to the patient's symptomatology and HCG levels.	
32056273        	Invited Review: Epigenetics in neurodevelopment.            	Neural development requires the orchestration of dynamic changes in gene expression to regulate cell fate decisions. This regulation is heavily influenced by epigenetics, heritable changes in gene expression not directly explained by genomic information alone. An understanding of the complexity of epigenetic regulation is rapidly emerging through the development of novel technologies that can assay various features of epigenetics and gene regulation. Here, we provide a broad overview of several commonly investigated modes of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, noncoding RNAs, as well as epitranscriptomics that describe modifications of RNA, in neurodevelopment and diseases. Rather than functioning in isolation, it is being increasingly appreciated that these various modes of gene regulation are dynamically interactive and coordinate the complex nature of neurodevelopment along multiple axes. Future work investigating these interactions will likely utilize 'multi-omic' strategies that assay cell fate dynamics in a high-dimensional and high-throughput fashion. Novel human neurodevelopmental models including iPSC and cerebral organoid systems may provide further insight into human-specific features of neurodevelopment and diseases.                © 2020 British Neuropathological Society.	
32327499        	A 3D iPSC-differentiation model identifies interleukin-3 as a regulator of early human hematopoietic specification.            	Hematopoietic development is spatiotemporally tightly regulated by defined cell-intrinsic and extrinsic modifiers. The role of cytokines has been intensively studied in adult hematopoiesis; however, their role in embryonic hematopoietic specification remains largely unexplored. Here, we used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and established a 3-dimensional, organoid-like differentiation system (hemanoid) maintaining the structural cellular integrity to evaluate the effect of cytokines on embryonic hematopoietic development. We show, that defined stages of early human hematopoietic development were recapitulated within the generated hemanoids. We identified KDR+/CD34high/CD144+/CD43-/CD45- hemato-endothelial progenitor cells (HEPs) forming organized, vasculature-like structures and giving rise to CD34low/CD144-/CD43+/CD45+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. We demonstrate that the endothelial to hematopoietic transition of HEPs is dependent on the presence of interleukin 3 (IL-3). Inhibition of IL-3 signalling blocked hematopoietic differentiation and arrested the cells in the HEP stage. Thus, our data suggest an important role for IL-3 in early human hematopoiesis by supporting the endothelial to hematopoietic transition of hemato-endothelial progenitor cells and highlight the potential of a hemanoid-based model to study human hematopoietic development.

31930988        	LKB1 Represses ATOH1 via PDK4 and Energy Metabolism and Regulates Intestinal Stem Cell Fate.            	In addition to the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, energy metabolism also regulates intestinal stem cell (ISC) function. Tumor suppressor and kinase STK11 (also called LKB1) regulates stem cells and cell metabolism. We investigated whether loss of LKB1 alters ISC homeostasis in mice.                We deleted LKB1 from ISCs in mice using Lgr5-regulated CRE-ERT2 (Lkb1Lgr5-KO mice) and the traced lineages by using a CRE-dependent TdTomato reporter. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses. We purified ISCs and intestinal progenitors using flow cytometry and performed RNA-sequencing analysis. We measured organoid-forming capacity and ISC percentages using intestinal tissues from Lkb1Lgr5-KO mice. We analyzed human Ls174t cells with knockdown of LKB1 or other proteins by immunoblotting, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the Seahorse live-cell metabolic assay.                Some intestinal crypts from Lkb1Lgr5-KO mice lost ISCs compared with crypts from control mice. However, most crypts from Lkb1Lgr5-KO mice contained functional ISCs that expressed increased levels of Atoh1 messenger RNA (mRNA), acquired a gene expression signature associated with secretory cells, and generated more cells in the secretory lineage compared with control mice. Knockdown of LKB1 in Ls174t cells induced expression of Atoh1 mRNA and a phenotype of increased mucin production; knockdown of ATOH1 prevented induction of this phenotype. The increased expression of Atoh1 mRNA after LKB1 loss from ISCs or Ls174t cells did not involve Notch or Wnt signaling. Knockdown of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) or inhibition with dichloroacetate reduced the up-regulation of Atoh1 mRNA after LKB1 knockdown in Ls174t cells. Cells with LKB1 knockdown had a reduced rate of oxygen consumption, which was partially restored by PDK4 inhibition with dichloroacetate. ISCs with knockout of LKB1 increased the expression of PDK4 and had an altered metabolic profile.                LKB1 represses transcription of ATOH1, via PDK4, in ISCs, restricting their differentiation into secretory lineages. These findings provide a connection between metabolism and the fate determination of ISCs.                Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
31469916        	CRAF Methylation by PRMT6 Regulates Aerobic Glycolysis-Driven Hepatocarcinogenesis via ERK-Dependent PKM2 Nuclear Relocalization and Activation.            	Most tumor cells use aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to support anabolic growth and promote tumorigenicity and drug resistance. Intriguingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. In this work, using gain-of-function and loss-of-function in vitro studies in patient-derived organoid and cell cultures as well as in vivo positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging animal models, we showed that protein arginine N-methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) regulates aerobic glycolysis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through nuclear relocalization of pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), a key regulator of the Warburg effect.                We found PRMT6 to methylate CRAF at arginine 100, interfering with its RAS/RAF binding potential, and therefore altering extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated PKM2 translocation into the nucleus. This altered PRMT6-ERK-PKM2 signaling axis was further confirmed in both a HCC mouse model with endogenous knockout of PRMT6 as well as in HCC clinical samples. We also identified PRMT6 as a target of hypoxia through the transcriptional repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor, linking PRMT6 with hypoxia in driving glycolytic events. Finally, we showed as a proof of concept the therapeutic potential of using 2-deoxyglucose, a glycolysis inhibitor, to reverse tumorigenicity and sorafenib resistance mediated by PRMT6 deficiency in HCC.                Our findings indicate that the PRMT6-ERK-PKM2 regulatory axis is an important determinant of the Warburg effect in tumor cells, and provide a mechanistic link among tumorigenicity, sorafenib resistance, and glucose metabolism.                © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.	
33406987        	Applications of Omics Technologies for Three-Dimensional In Vitro Disease Models.            	Omics technologies, such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, multiomics, and integrated modalities, have greatly contributed to our understanding of various diseases by enabling researchers to probe the molecular wiring of cellular systems in a high-throughput and precise manner. With the development of tissue-engineered three-dimensional (3D) in vitro disease models, such as organoids and spheroids, there is potential of integrating omics technologies with 3D disease models to elucidate the complex links between genotype and phenotype. These 3D disease models have been used to model cancer, infectious disease, toxicity, neurological disorders, and others. In this review, we provide an overview of omics technologies, highlight current and emerging studies, discuss the associated experimental design considerations, barriers and challenges of omics technologies, and provide an outlook on the future applications of omics technologies with 3D models. Overall, this review aims to provide a valuable resource for tissue engineers seeking to leverage omics technologies for diving deeper into biological discovery.	
29444419        	Pak1 Kinase Maintains Apical Membrane Identity in Epithelia.            	Epithelial cells are polarized along their apical-basal axis by the action of the small GTPase Cdc42, which is known to activate the aPKC kinase at the apical domain. However, loss of aPKC kinase activity was reported to have only mild effects on epithelial cell polarity. Here, we show that Cdc42 also activates a second kinase, Pak1, to specify apical domain identity in Drosophila and mammalian epithelia. aPKC and Pak1 phosphorylate an overlapping set of polarity substrates in kinase assays. Inactivating both aPKC kinase activity and the Pak1 kinase leads to a complete loss of epithelial polarity and morphology, with cells losing markers of apical polarization such as Crumbs, Par3/Bazooka, or ZO-1. This function of Pak1 downstream of Cdc42 is distinct from its role in regulating integrins or E-cadherin. Our results define a conserved dual-kinase mechanism for the control of apical membrane identity in epithelia.                Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

31212972        	Distinct Localization of Mature HGF from its Precursor Form in Developing and Repairing the Stomach.            	Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is secreted as an inactive single-chain HGF (scHGF); however, only proteolytically processed two-chain HGF (tcHGF) can activate the MET receptor. We investigated the localization of tcHGF and activated/phosphorylated MET (pMET) using a tcHGF-specific antibody. In day 16.5 mouse embryos, total HGF (scHGF + tcHGF) was mainly localized in smooth muscle cells close to, but separate from, MET-positive epithelial cells in endodermal organs, including the stomach. In the adult stomach, total HGF was localized in smooth muscle cells, and tcHGF was mainly localized in the glandular base region. Immunostaining for pMET and Lgr5-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicated that pMET localization overlapped with Lgr5+ gastric stem cells. HGF promoted organoid formation similar to EGF, indicating the potential for HGF to promote the survival and growth of gastric stem cells. pMET and tcHGF localizations changed during regeneration following gastric injury. These results indicate that MET is constantly activated in gastric stem cells and that the localization of pMET differs from the primary localization of precursor HGF but has a close relationship to tcHGF. Our results suggest the importance of the microenvironmental generation of tcHGF in the regulation of development, regeneration, and stem cell behavior.	
30878879        	Functional Heterogeneity of Mouse Prostate Stromal Cells Revealed by Single-Cell RNA-Seq.            	We perform a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to investigate the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of the adult mouse prostate stromal cells. Our analysis identifies three major cell populations representing the smooth muscle cells and two types of fibroblast cells enriched by Sca-1 and CD90. The Sca-1+CD90+ fibroblast cells are in direct contact with the epithelial cells and express growth factors and genes associated with cell motility, developmental process, and androgen biosynthesis. This suggests that they may regulate epithelial cell survival and growth. The Sca-1+CD90-/low myofibroblast-like cells highly express genes associated with the extracellular matrix and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, indicating a role in tissue repair and immune responses. The Sca-1+CD90-/low cells significantly suppress the capacity of the basal cells for bipotent differentiation in the prostate organoid assay. Collectively, we identify the surface markers enabling physical separation of stromal subpopulations and generate the gene expression profiles implying their cellular functions.

22295147        	Pathologic observations of the duodenum in 615 consecutive duodenal specimens in a single Japanese hospital: II. malignant lesions.            	The author investigated histopathology of 615 consecutive duodenal specimens in our pathology laboratory in Japan. A computer review of the duodenal specimens was done. In cases of malignancy, histological slides were reviewed. The duodenal specimens were composed of 567 benign lesions (92%) and 48 malignant lesions (8%). The 48 malignant lesions were composed of 20 cases (42%) of primary adenocarcinoma, 10 cases (21%) of primary adenocarcinoma of ampulla Vater, 4 cases (8%) of primary squamous cell carcinoma, 1 (2%) cases of primary spindle cell carcinoma, 4 (8%) cases of carcinoid tumors, 1 (2%) case of malignant lymphoma, and 8 cases (17%) of secondary carcinoma from the pancreatic carcinoma or bile duct carcinoma. The primary adenocarcinoma (n=20) was composed of well differentiated adenocarcinoma (n=9), papillary adenocarcinoma (n=1), moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (n=6), and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (n=4). The primary adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (n=10) was composed of well differentiated adenocarcinoma (n=7) and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (n=3). The primary squamous cell carcinoma (n=4) showed proliferation of malignant squamous cells with keratinization and intercellular bridges. The spindle cell carcinoma (n=1) consisted of only malignant spindle cells immunohistochemistry positive for various cytokeratins and vimentin. The carcinoid tumor (n=4) was typical carcinoid and showed organoid, trabecular, and ribbon-like arrangements. The carcinoid tumor was immunohistochemically positive for neuroendocrine markers such as CD56, neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin. The malignant lymphoma (n=1) was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma immunohistochemically positive for CD10, CD20, and CD79α. The secondary carcinoma (n=8) was adenocarcinoma invaded from the pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=6) and extrahepatic bile duct adenocarcinoma (n=2).	
27869785        	Classic IL-6R signalling is dispensable for intestinal epithelial proliferation and repair.            	Inflammatory bowel disease is characterized by disturbed cytokine signalling in the mucosa. Inhibition of the proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 pathway is a promising new therapeutic strategy, but safety concerns arise as IL-6 signalling also contributes to epithelial repair of the intestinal mucosa. To which extent IL-6 classic or trans-signalling contributes to intestinal repair remains elusive. We tested the influence of IL-6 classic signalling on intestinal repair and proliferation. Whereas IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in the colonic cancer cell lines, primary non-malignant intestinal organoids did not respond to IL-6 classic signalling. Mice deficient in intestinal IL-6R (IL-6RΔIEC mice) did not display increased susceptibility to acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. In the azoxymethane DSS model IL-6RΔIEC mice were not protected from inflammation-induced carcinogenesis but showed comparable tumor load to wild-type mice. These data indicate that classic signalling is not the major pathway to transduce IL-6 stimuli into the intestinal epithelium.	
29428530        	Rotenone exerts developmental neurotoxicity in a human brain spheroid model.            	Growing concern suggests that some chemicals exert (developmental) neurotoxicity (DNT and NT) and are linked to the increase in incidence of autism, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders. The high cost of routine tests for DNT and NT assessment make it difficult to test the high numbers of existing chemicals. Thus, more cost effective neurodevelopmental models are needed. The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in combination with the emerging human 3D tissue culture platforms, present a novel tool to predict and study human toxicity. By combining these technologies, we generated multicellular brain spheroids (BrainSpheres) from human iPSC. The model has previously shown to be reproducible and recapitulates several neurodevelopmental features. Our results indicate, rotenone's toxic potency varies depending on the differentiation status of the cells, showing higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) and higher mitochondrial dysfunction during early than later differentiation stages. Immuno-fluorescence morphology analysis after rotenone exposure indicated dopaminergic-neuron selective toxicity at non-cytotoxic concentrations (1 μM), while astrocytes and other neuronal cell types were affected at (general) cytotoxic concentrations (25 μM). Omics analysis showed changes in key pathways necessary for brain development, indicating rotenone as a developmental neurotoxicant and show a possible link between previously shown effects on neurite outgrowth and presently observed effects on Ca2+ reabsorption, synaptogenesis and PPAR pathway disruption. In conclusion, our BrainSpheres model has shown to be a reproducible and novel tool to study neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity. Results presented here support the idea that rotenone can potentially be a developmental neurotoxicant.                Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.	
19758371        	Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in a linear nevus verrucosus.            	Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum (SCACP), the malignant counterpart of syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP), is a rare form of adenocarcinoma of the skin. Only 11 well-documented case reports of SCACP have been published so far. An 83-year-old woman with a linear nevus verrucosus (LNV) on her right arm had a history of a nodule arising within this nevus that was diagnosed as SCAP by skin biopsy 7 years earlier. Since then, the nodule had enlarged gradually and formed an exophytic tumor with a moist surface, measuring 3 × 2.5 cm. The tumor was excised and studied by histologic examination. Although histologically the overall architecture of the tumor still resembled SCAP, transition to SCACP was obvious by the presence of areas of cytonuclear atypia, increased proliferative activity and infiltrative growth. The edges of the excised ellipse flanking the tumor showed typical microscopic features of LNV, but no organoid components of nevus sebaceus (NS).We report the 12th case of SCACP, the first case of SCACP on the arm and the first case of SCACP arising from pre-existing SCAP, in what appeared to be an epidermal nevus.

26068591        	Ribosome biogenesis dysfunction leads to p53-mediated apoptosis and goblet cell differentiation of mouse intestinal stem/progenitor cells.            	Ribosome biogenesis is an essential cellular process. Its impairment is associated with developmental defects and increased risk of cancer. The in vivo cellular responses to defective ribosome biogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In particular, the consequences of impaired ribosome biogenesis within the intestinal epithelium in mammals have not been investigated so far. Here we adopted a genetic approach to investigate the role of Notchless (NLE), an essential actor of ribosome biogenesis, in the adult mouse intestinal lineage. Nle deficiency led to defects in the synthesis of large ribosomal subunit in crypts cells and resulted in the rapid elimination of intestinal stem cells and progenitors through distinct types of cellular responses, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and biased differentiation toward the goblet cell lineage. Similar observations were made using the rRNA transcription inhibitor CX-5461 on intestinal organoids culture. Importantly, we found that p53 activation was responsible for most of the cellular responses observed, including differentiation toward the goblet cell lineage. Moreover, we identify the goblet cell-specific marker Muc2 as a direct transcriptional target of p53. Nle-deficient ISCs and progenitors disappearance persisted in the absence of p53, underlying the existence of p53-independent cellular responses following defective ribosome biogenesis. Our data indicate that NLE is a crucial factor for intestinal homeostasis and provide new insights into how perturbations of ribosome biogenesis impact on cell fate decisions within the intestinal epithelium.	
20510732        	Artificial engineering of secondary lymphoid organs.            	Secondary lymphoid organs such as spleen and lymph nodes are highly organized immune structures essential for the initiation of immune responses. They display distinct B cell and T cell compartments associated with specific stromal follicular dendritic cells and fibroblastic reticular cells, respectively. Interweaved through the parenchyma is a conduit system that distributes small antigens and chemokines directly to B and T cell zones. While most structural aspects between lymph nodes and spleen are common, the entry of lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and antigen into lymphoid tissues is regulated differently, reflecting the specialized functions of each organ in filtering either lymph or blood. The overall organization of lymphoid tissue is vital for effective antigen screening and recognition, and is a feature which artificially constructed lymphoid organoids endeavor to replicate. Synthesis of artificial lymphoid tissues is an emerging field that aims to provide therapeutic application for the treatment of severe infection, cancer, and age-related involution of secondary lymphoid tissues. The development of murine artificial lymphoid tissues has benefited greatly from an understanding of organogenesis of lymphoid organs, which has delineated cellular and molecular elements essential for the recruitment and organization of lymphocytes into lymphoid structures. Here, the field of artificial lymphoid tissue engineering is considered including elements of lymphoid structure and development relevant to organoid synthesis.                (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

29915057        	Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived glial cells and neural progenitors display divergent responses to Zika and dengue infections.            	Maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is recognized as the cause of an epidemic of microcephaly and other neurological anomalies in human fetuses. It remains unclear how ZIKV accesses the highly vulnerable population of neural progenitors of the fetal central nervous system (CNS), and which cell types of the CNS may be viral reservoirs. In contrast, the related dengue virus (DENV) does not elicit teratogenicity. To model viral interaction with cells of the fetal CNS in vitro, we investigated the tropism of ZIKV and DENV for different induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cells, with a particular focus on microglia-like cells. We show that ZIKV infected isogenic neural progenitors, astrocytes, and microglia-like cells (pMGLs), but was only cytotoxic to neural progenitors. Infected glial cells propagated ZIKV and maintained ZIKV load over time, leading to viral spread to susceptible cells. DENV triggered stronger immune responses and could be cleared by neural and glial cells more efficiently. pMGLs, when cocultured with neural spheroids, invaded the tissue and, when infected with ZIKV, initiated neural infection. Since microglia derive from primitive macrophages originating in proximity to the maternal vasculature, they may act as a viral reservoir for ZIKV and establish infection of the fetal brain. Infection of immature neural stem cells by invading microglia may occur in the early stages of pregnancy, before angiogenesis in the brain rudiments. Our data are also consistent with ZIKV and DENV affecting the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, thus allowing infection of the brain later in life.	
28457793        	Multi-site Neurogenin3 Phosphorylation Controls Pancreatic Endocrine Differentiation.            	The proneural transcription factor Neurogenin3 (Ngn3) plays a critical role in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation, although regulation of Ngn3 protein is largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that Ngn3 protein undergoes cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-mediated phosphorylation on multiple serine-proline sites. Replacing wild-type protein with a phosphomutant form of Ngn3 increases α cell generation, the earliest endocrine cell type to be formed in the developing pancreas. Moreover, un(der)phosphorylated Ngn3 maintains insulin expression in adult β cells in the presence of elevated c-Myc and enhances endocrine specification during ductal reprogramming. Mechanistically, preventing multi-site phosphorylation enhances both Ngn3 stability and DNA binding, promoting the increased expression of target genes that drive differentiation. Therefore, multi-site phosphorylation of Ngn3 controls its ability to promote pancreatic endocrine differentiation and to maintain β cell function in the presence of pro-proliferation cues and could be manipulated to promote and maintain endocrine differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

30323305        	Lrig1 marks a population of gastric epithelial cells capable of long-term tissue maintenance and growth in vitro.            	The processes involved in renewal of the epithelium that lines the mouse stomach remain unclear. Apart from the cells in the isthmus, several other populations located deeper in the gastric glands have been suggested to contribute to the maintenance of the gastric epithelium. Here, we reveal that Lrig1 is expressed in the basal layer of the forestomach and the lower part of glands in the corpus and pylorus. In the glandular epithelium of the stomach, Lrig1 marks a heterogeneous population comprising mainly non-proliferative cells. Yet, fate-mapping experiments using a knock-in mouse line expressing Cre specifically in Lrig1+ cells demonstrate that these cells are able to contribute to the long-term maintenance of the gastric epithelium. Moreover, when cultured in vitro, cells expressing high level of Lrig1 have much higher organoid forming potential than the corresponding cellular populations expressing lower levels of Lrig1. Taken together, these observations show that Lrig1 is expressed primarily by differentiated cells, but that these cells can be recruited to contribute to the maintenance of the gastric epithelium. This confirms previous observations that cells located in the lower segments of gastric glands can participate in tissue replenishment.	
30208313        	Activation of Ras in the Vascular Endothelium Induces Brain Vascular Malformations and Hemorrhagic Stroke.            	Cerebrovascular malformations (CVMs) affect approximately 3% of the population, risking hemorrhagic stroke, seizures, and neurological deficits. Recently Ras mutations have been identified in a majority of brain arterio-venous malformations. We generated an endothelial-specific, inducible HRASV12 mouse model, which results in dilated, proliferative blood vessels in the brain, blood-brain barrier breakdown, intracerebral hemorrhage, and rapid lethality. Organoid morphogenesis models revealed abnormal cessation of proliferation, abnormalities in expression of tip and stalk genes, and a failure to properly form elongating tubes. These defects were influenced by both hyperactive PI-3' kinase signaling and altered TGF-β signaling. Several phenotypic changes predicted by the in vitro morphogenesis analysis were validated in the mouse model. These data provide a model of brain vascular malformations induced by mutant Ras and reveal insights into intersecting molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of brain vascular malformations.

30203582        	Pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection.            	In this review, we highlight progress in the last year in characterizing known virulence factors like flagella and the Cag type IV secretion system with sophisticated structural and biochemical approaches to yield new insight on the assembly and functions of these critical virulence determinants. Several aspects of Helicobacter pylori physiology were newly explored this year and evaluated for their functions during stomach colonization, including a fascinating role for the essential protease HtrA in allowing access of H. pylori to the basolateral side of the gastric epithelium through cleavage of the tight junction protein E-cadherin to facilitate CagA delivery. Molecular biology tools standard in model bacteria, including regulated gene expression during animal infection and fluorescent reporter gene fusions, were newly applied to H. pylori to explore functions for urease beyond initial colonization and establish high salt consumption as a mediator of gene expression changes. New sequencing technologies enabled validation of long postulated roles for DNA methylation in regulating H. pylori gene expression. On the cell biology side, elegant work using lineage tracing in the murine model and organoid primary cell culture systems has provided new insights into how H. pylori manipulates gastric tissue functions, locally and at a distance, to promote its survival in the stomach and induce pathologic changes. Finally, new work has bolstered the case for genomic variation as an important mechanism to generate phenotypic diversity during changing environmental conditions in the context of diet manipulation in animal infection models and during human experimental infection after vaccination.                © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	
29532564        	ETV5 regulates ductal morphogenesis with Sox9 and is critical for regeneration from pancreatitis.            	The plasticity of pancreatic acinar cells to undergo acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) has been demonstrated to contribute to the regeneration of the pancreas in response to injury. Sox9 is critical for ductal cell fate and important in the formation of ADM, most likely in concert with a complex hierarchy of, as yet, not fully elucidated transcription factors.                By using a mouse model of acute pancreatitis and three dimensional organoid culture of primary pancreatic ductal cells, we herein characterize the Ets-transcription factor Etv5 as a pivotal regulator of ductal cell identity and ADM that acts upstream of Sox9 and is essential for Sox9 expression in ADM. Loss of Etv5 is associated with increased severity of acute pancreatitis and impaired ADM formation leading to delayed tissue regeneration and recovery in response to injury.                Our data provide new insights in the regulation of ADM with implications in our understanding of pancreatic homeostasis, pancreatitis and epithelial plasticity.

29669275        	Zika Virus Can Strongly Infect and Disrupt Secondary Organizers in the Ventricular Zone of the Embryonic Chicken Brain.            	Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with severe neurodevelopmental impairments in human fetuses, including microencephaly. Previous reports examining neural progenitor tropism of ZIKV in organoid and animal models did not address whether the virus infects all neural progenitors uniformly. To explore this, ZIKV was injected into the neural tube of 2-day-old chicken embryos, resulting in nonuniform periventricular infection 3 days later. Recurrent foci of intense infection were present at specific signaling centers that influence neuroepithelial patterning at a distance through secretion of morphogens. ZIKV infection reduced transcript levels for 3 morphogens, SHH, BMP7, and FGF8 expressed at the midbrain basal plate, hypothalamic floor plate, and isthmus, respectively. Levels of Patched1, a SHH-pathway downstream gene, were also reduced, and a SHH-dependent cell population in the ventral midbrain was shifted in position. Thus, the diminishment of signaling centers through ZIKV-mediated apoptosis may yield broader, non-cell-autonomous changes in brain patterning.                Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

32641470        	Naproxen chemoprevention promotes immune activation in Lynch syndrome colorectal mucosa.            	Patients with Lynch syndrome (LS) are at markedly increased risk for colorectal cancer. It is being increasingly recognised that the immune system plays an essential role in LS tumour development, thus making an ideal target for cancer prevention. Our objective was to evaluate the safety, assess the activity and discover novel molecular pathways involved in the activity of naproxen as primary and secondary chemoprevention in patients with LS.                We conducted a Phase Ib, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial of two dose levels of naproxen sodium (440 and 220 mg) administered daily for 6 months to 80 participants with LS, and a co-clinical trial using a genetically engineered mouse model of LS and patient-derived organoids (PDOs).                Overall, the total number of adverse events was not different across treatment arms with excellent tolerance of the intervention. The level of prostaglandin E2 in the colorectal mucosa was significantly decreased after treatment with naproxen when compared with placebo. Naproxen activated different resident immune cell types without any increase in lymphoid cellularity, and changed the expression patterns of the intestinal crypt towards epithelial differentiation and stem cell regulation. Naproxen demonstrated robust chemopreventive activity in a mouse co-clinical trial and gene expression profiles induced by naproxen in humans showed perfect discrimination of mice specimens with LS and PDOs treated with naproxen and control.                Naproxen is a promising strategy for immune interception in LS. We have discovered naproxen-induced gene expression profiles for their potential use as predictive biomarkers of drug activity.                gov Identifier: NCT02052908.                © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

28778969        	From Ras to Rap and Back, a Journey of 35 Years.            	Our laboratory has studied Ras and Ras-like proteins since the discovery of the Ras oncogene 35 years ago. In this review, I will give an account of what we have done in these 35 years and indicate the main papers that have guided our research. Our efforts started with the early analysis of mutant Ras in human tumors followed by deciphering of the role of Ras in signal transduction pathways. In an attempt to interfere in Ras signaling we turned to Rap proteins. These proteins are the closest relatives of Ras and were initially identified as Ras antagonists. However, our studies revealed that the Rap signaling network primarily is involved in spatiotemporal control of cell adhesion, in part through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. More recently we returned to Ras, trying to interfere in Ras signaling by combinatorial drug testing using the organoid technology.

26968771        	A three-dimensional human model of the fibroblast activation that accompanies bronchopulmonary dysplasia identifies Notch-mediated pathophysiology.            	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a leading complication of premature birth and occurs primarily in infants delivered during the saccular stage of lung development. Histopathology shows decreased alveolarization and a pattern of fibroblast proliferation and differentiation to the myofibroblast phenotype. Little is known about the molecular pathways and cellular mechanisms that define BPD pathophysiology and progression. We have developed a novel three-dimensional human model of the fibroblast activation associated with BPD, and using this model we have identified the Notch pathway as a key driver of fibroblast activation and proliferation in response to changes in oxygen. Fetal lung fibroblasts were cultured on sodium alginate beads to generate lung organoids. After exposure to alternating hypoxia and hyperoxia, the organoids developed a phenotypic response characterized by increased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and other genes known to be upregulated in BPD and also demonstrated increased expression of downstream effectors of the Notch pathway. Inhibition of Notch with a γ-secretase inhibitor prevented the development of the pattern of cellular proliferation and α-SMA expression in our model. Analysis of human autopsy tissue from the lungs of infants who expired with BPD demonstrated evidence of Notch activation within fibrotic areas of the alveolar septae, suggesting that Notch may be a key driver of BPD pathophysiology.

26224313        	The cellular prion protein PrPc is a partner of the Wnt pathway in intestinal epithelial cells.            	We reported previously that the cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is a component of desmosomes and contributes to the intestinal barrier function. We demonstrated also the presence of PrP(c) in the nucleus of proliferating intestinal epithelial cells. Here we sought to decipher the function of this nuclear pool. In human intestinal cancer cells Caco-2/TC7 and SW480 and normal crypt-like HIEC-6 cells, PrP(c) interacts, in cytoplasm and nucleus, with γ-catenin, one of its desmosomal partners, and with β-catenin and TCF7L2, effectors of the canonical Wnt pathway. PrP(c) up-regulates the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin/TCF7L2 complex, whereas γ-catenin down-regulates it. Silencing of PrP(c) results in the modulation of several Wnt target gene expressions in human cells, with different effects depending on their Wnt signaling status, and in mouse intestinal crypt cells in vivo. PrP(c) also interacts with the Hippo pathway effector YAP, suggesting that it may contribute to the regulation of gene transcription beyond the β-catenin/TCF7L2 complex. Finally, we demonstrate that PrP(c) is required for proper formation of intestinal organoids, indicating that it contributes to proliferation and survival of intestinal progenitors. In conclusion, PrP(c) must be considered as a new modulator of the Wnt signaling pathway in proliferating intestinal epithelial cells.                 © 2015 Besnier et al.

32432544        	R-spondins engage heparan sulfate proteoglycans to potentiate WNT signaling.            	R-spondins (RSPOs) amplify WNT signaling during development and regenerative responses. We previously demonstrated that RSPOs 2 and 3 potentiate WNT/β-catenin signaling in cells lacking leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs) 4, 5 and 6 (Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018). We now show that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as alternative co-receptors for RSPO3 using a combination of ligand mutagenesis and ligand engineering. Mutations in RSPO3 residues predicted to contact HSPGs impair its signaling capacity. Conversely, the HSPG-binding domains of RSPO3 can be entirely replaced with an antibody that recognizes heparan sulfate (HS) chains attached to multiple HSPGs without diminishing WNT-potentiating activity in cultured cells and intestinal organoids. A genome-wide screen for mediators of RSPO3 signaling in cells lacking LGRs 4, 5 and 6 failed to reveal other receptors. We conclude that HSPGs are RSPO co-receptors that potentiate WNT signaling in the presence and absence of LGRs.	
33045662        	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of second-generation benzoylpiperidine derivatives as reversible monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitors.            	An interesting enzyme of the endocannabinoid system is monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). This enzyme, which metabolizes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), has attracted great interest due to its involvement in several physiological and pathological processes, such as cancer progression. Experimental evidences highlighted some drawbacks associated with the use of irreversible MAGL inhibitors in vivo, therefore the research field concerning reversible inhibitors is rapidly growing. In the present manuscript, the class of benzoylpiperidine-based MAGL inhibitors was further expanded and optimized. Enzymatic assays identified some compounds in the low nanomolar range and steered molecular dynamics simulations predicted the dissociation itinerary of one of the best compounds from the enzyme, confirming the observed structure-activity relationship. Biological evaluation, including assays in intact U937 cells and competitive activity-based protein profiling experiments in mouse brain membranes, confirmed the selectivity of the selected compounds for MAGL versus other components of the endocannabinoid system. An antiproliferative ability in a panel of cancer cell lines highlighted their potential as potential anticancer agents. Future studies on the potential use of these compounds in the clinical setting are also supported by the inhibition of cell growth observed both in cancer organoids derived from high grade serous ovarian cancer patients and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma primary cells, which showed genetic and histological features very similar to the primary tumors.

27570798        	Immunofluorescent Staining of Mouse Intestinal Stem Cells.            	Immunofluorescent staining of organoids can be performed to visualize molecular markers of cell behavior. For example, cell proliferation marked by incorporation of nucleotide (EdU), or to observe markers of intestinal differentiation including paneth cells, goblet cells, or enterocytes (see Figure 1).

26549850        	Isolation of Human Colon Stem Cells Using Surface Expression of PTK7.            	Insertion of reporter cassettes into the Lgr5 locus has enabled the characterization of mouse intestinal stem cells (ISCs). However, low cell surface abundance of LGR5 protein and lack of high-affinity anti-LGR5 antibodies represent a roadblock to efficiently isolate human colonic stem cells (hCoSCs). We set out to identify stem cell markers that would allow for purification of hCoSCs. In an unbiased approach, membrane-enriched protein fractions derived from in vitro human colonic organoids were analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Protein tyrosine pseudokinase PTK7 specified a cell population within human colonic organoids characterized by highest self-renewal and re-seeding capacity. Antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain of PTK7 allowed us to isolate and expand hCoSCs directly from patient-derived mucosa samples. Human PTK7+ cells display features of canonical Lgr5+ ISCs and include a fraction of cells that undergo differentiation toward enteroendocrine lineage that resemble crypt label retaining cells (LRCs).

32828819        	Succinate Produced by Intestinal Microbes Promotes Specification of Tuft Cells to Suppress Ileal Inflammation.            	Countries endemic for parasitic infestations have a lower incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) than nonendemic countries, and there have been anecdotal reports of the beneficial effects of helminths in CD patients. Tuft cells in the small intestine sense and direct the immune response against eukaryotic parasites. We investigated the activities of tuft cells in patients with CD and mouse models of intestinal inflammation.                We used microscopy to quantify tuft cells in intestinal specimens from patients with ileal CD (n = 19), healthy individuals (n = 14), and TNFΔARE/+ mice, which develop Crohn's-like ileitis. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, and microbiome profiling of intestinal tissues from wild-type and Atoh1-knockout mice, which have expansion of tuft cells, to study interactions between microbes and tuft cell populations. We assessed microbe dependence of tuft cell populations using microbiome depletion, organoids, and microbe transplant experiments. We used multiplex imaging and cytokine assays to assess alterations in inflammatory response following expansion of tuft cells with succinate administration in TNFΔARE/+ and anti-CD3E CD mouse models.                Inflamed ileal tissues from patients and mice had reduced numbers of tuft cells, compared with healthy individuals or wild-type mice. Expansion of tuft cells was associated with increased expression of genes that regulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which resulted from microbe production of the metabolite succinate. Experiments in which we manipulated the intestinal microbiota of mice revealed the existence of an ATOH1-independent population of tuft cells that was sensitive to metabolites produced by microbes. Administration of succinate to mice expanded tuft cells and reduced intestinal inflammation in TNFΔARE/+ mice and anti-CD3E-treated mice, increased GATA3+ cells and type 2 cytokines (IL22, IL25, IL13), and decreased RORGT+ cells and type 17 cytokines (IL23) in a tuft cell-dependent manner.                We found that tuft cell expansion reduced chronic intestinal inflammation in mice. Strategies to expand tuft cells might be developed for treatment of CD.                Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

33257861        	A comprehensive library of human transcription factors for cell fate engineering.            	Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer an unprecedented opportunity to model diverse cell types and tissues. To enable systematic exploration of the programming landscape mediated by transcription factors (TFs), we present the Human TFome, a comprehensive library containing 1,564 TF genes and 1,732 TF splice isoforms. By screening the library in three hPSC lines, we discovered 290 TFs, including 241 that were previously unreported, that induce differentiation in 4 days without alteration of external soluble or biomechanical cues. We used four of the hits to program hPSCs into neurons, fibroblasts, oligodendrocytes and vascular endothelial-like cells that have molecular and functional similarity to primary cells. Our cell-autonomous approach enabled parallel programming of hPSCs into multiple cell types simultaneously. We also demonstrated orthogonal programming by including oligodendrocyte-inducible hPSCs with unmodified hPSCs to generate cerebral organoids, which expedited in situ myelination. Large-scale combinatorial screening of the Human TFome will complement other strategies for cell engineering based on developmental biology and computational systems biology.	
32747796        	Reprogramming of host glutamine metabolism during Chlamydia trachomatis infection and its key role in peptidoglycan synthesis.            	Obligate intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis undergo a complex developmental cycle between infectious, non-replicative elementary-body and non-infectious, replicative reticulate-body forms. Elementary bodies transform to reticulate bodies shortly after entering a host cell, a crucial process in infection, initiating chlamydial replication. As Chlamydia fail to replicate outside the host cell, it is unknown how the replicative part of the developmental cycle is initiated. Here we show, using a cell-free approach in axenic media, that the uptake of glutamine by the bacteria is crucial for peptidoglycan synthesis, which has a role in Chlamydia replication. The increased requirement for glutamine in infected cells is satisfied by reprogramming the glutamine metabolism in a c-Myc-dependent manner. Glutamine is effectively taken up by the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 and metabolized via glutaminase. Interference with this metabolic reprogramming limits the growth of Chlamydia. Intriguingly, Chlamydia failed to produce progeny in SLC1A5-knockout organoids and mice. Thus, we report on the central role of glutamine for the development of an obligate intracellular pathogenic bacterium and the reprogramming of host glutamine metabolism, which may provide a basis for innovative anti-infection strategies.

In this Review, we discuss previous efforts in materials science in developing imaging systems and microfluidic devices for the in-depth and real-time investigation of viral structures and transmission, as well as material platforms for the detection of viruses and the delivery of antiviral drugs and vaccines. We highlight the contribution of materials science to the manufacturing of personal protective equipment and to the design of simple, accurate and low-cost virus-detection devices. We then investigate future possibilities of materials science in antiviral research and treatment development, examining the role of materials in antiviral-drug design, including the importance of synthetic material platforms for organoids and organs-on-a-chip, in drug delivery and vaccination, and for the production of medical equipment. Materials-science-based technologies not only contribute to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 research efforts but can also provide platforms and tools for the understanding, protection, detection and treatment of future viral diseases.                © Springer Nature Limited 2020.	
30389919        	ARTS mediates apoptosis and regeneration of the intestinal stem cell niche.            	Stem cells (SCs) play a pivotal role in fueling homeostasis and regeneration. While much focus has been given to self-renewal and differentiation pathways regulating SC fate, little is known regarding the specific mechanisms utilized for their elimination. Here, we report that the pro-apoptotic protein ARTS (a Septin4 isoform) is highly expressed in cells comprising the intestinal SC niche and that its deletion protects Lgr5+ and Paneth cells from undergoing apoptotic cell death. As a result, the Sept4/ARTS-/- crypt displays augmented proliferation and, in culture, generates massive cystic-like organoids due to enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Importantly, Sept4/ARTS-/- mice exhibit resistance against intestinal damage in a manner dependent upon Lgr5+ SCs. Finally, we show that ARTS interacts with XIAP in intestinal crypt cells and that deletion of XIAP can abrogate Sept4/ARTS-/--dependent phenotypes. Our results indicate that intestinal SCs utilize specific apoptotic proteins for their elimination, representing a unique target for regenerative medicine.	
29949240        	The mechanistic basis for chromatin regulation by pioneer transcription factors.            	Pioneer transcription factors play a primary role in establishing competence for gene expression and initiating cellular programming and reprogramming, and their dysregulation causes severe effects on human health, such as promoting tumorigenesis. Although more than 200 transcription factors are expressed in each cell type, only a small number of transcription factors are necessary to elicit dramatic cell-fate changes in embryonic development and cell-fate conversion. Among these key transcription factors, a subset called "pioneer transcription factors" have a remarkable ability to target nucleosomal DNA, or closed chromatin, early in development, often leading to the local opening of chromatin, thereby establishing competence for gene expression. Although more key transcription factors have been identified as pioneer transcription factors, the molecular mechanisms behind their special properties are only beginning to be revealed. Understanding the pioneering mechanisms will enhance our ability to precisely control cell fate at will for research and therapeutic purposes.

23405135        	Horizontal transmission of malignancy: in-vivo fusion of human lymphomas with hamster stroma produces tumors retaining human genes and lymphoid pathology.            	We report the in-vivo fusion of two Hodgkin lymphomas with golden hamster cheek pouch cells, resulting in serially-transplanted (over 5-6 years) GW-532 and GW-584 heterosynkaryon tumor cells displaying both human and hamster DNA (by FISH), lymphoma-like morphology, aggressive metastasis, and retention of 7 human genes (CD74, CXCR4, CD19, CD20, CD71, CD79b, and VIM) out of 24 tested by PCR. The prevalence of B-cell restricted genes (CD19, CD20, and CD79b) suggests that this uniform population may be the clonal initiating (malignant) cells of Hodgkin lymphoma, despite their not showing translation to their respective proteins by immunohistochemical analysis. This is believed to be the first report of in-vivo cell-cell fusion of human lymphoma and rodent host cells, and may be a method to disclose genes regulating both organoid and metastasis signatures, suggesting that the horizontal transfer of tumor DNA to adjacent stromal cells may be implicated in tumor heterogeneity and progression. The B-cell gene signature of the hybrid xenografts suggests that Hodgkin lymphoma, or its initiating cells, is a B-cell malignancy.	
32966340        	Autophagy mitigates ethanol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in esophageal keratinocytes.            	During alcohol consumption, the esophageal mucosa is directly exposed to high concentrations of ethanol (EtOH). We therefore investigated the response of normal human esophageal epithelial cell lines EPC1, EPC2 and EPC3 to acute EtOH exposure. While these cells were able to tolerate 2% EtOH for 8 h in both three-dimensional organoids and monolayer culture conditions, RNA sequencing suggested that EtOH induced mitochondrial dysfunction. With EtOH treatment, EPC1 and EPC2 cells also demonstrated decreased mitochondrial ATPB protein expression by immunofluorescence and swollen mitochondria lacking intact cristae by transmission electron microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was decreased in a subset of EPC1 and EPC2 cells stained with ΔΨm-sensitive dye MitoTracker Deep Red. In EPC2, EtOH decreased ATP level while impairing mitochondrial respiration and electron transportation chain functions, as determined by ATP fluorometric assay, respirometry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, EPC2 cells demonstrated enhanced oxidative stress by flow cytometry for mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX), which was antagonized by the mitochondria-specific antioxidant MitoCP. Concurrently, EPC1 and EPC2 cells underwent autophagy following EtOH exposure, as evidenced by flow cytometry for Cyto-ID, which detects autophagic vesicles, and immunoblots demonstrating induction of the lipidated and cleaved form of LC3B and downregulation of SQSTM1/p62. In EPC1 and EPC2, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy flux by chloroquine increased mitochondrial oxidative stress while decreasing cell viability. In EPC2, autophagy induction was coupled with phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, and dephosphorylation of downstream substrates of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex (mTORC)-1 signaling. Pharmacological AMPK activation by AICAR decreased EtOH-induced reduction of ΔΨm and ATP in EPC2. Taken together, acute EtOH exposure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in esophageal keratinocytes, where the AMPK-mTORC1 axis may serve as a regulatory mechanism to activate autophagy to provide cytoprotection against EtOH-induced cell injury.	
32942701        	Mechanical Properties of Electrospun, Blended Fibrinogen: PCL Nanofibers.            	Electrospun nanofibers manufactured from biocompatible materials are used in numerous bioengineering applications, such as tissue engineering, creating organoids or dressings, and drug delivery. In many of these applications, the morphological and mechanical properties of the single fiber affect their function. We used a combined atomic force microscope (AFM)/optical microscope technique to determine the mechanical properties of nanofibers that were electrospun from a 50:50 fibrinogen:PCL (poly-ε-caprolactone) blend. Both of these materials are widely available and biocompatible. Fibers were spun onto a striated substrate with 6 μm wide grooves, anchored with epoxy on the ridges and pulled with the AFM probe. The fibers showed significant strain softening, as the modulus decreased from an initial value of 1700 MPa (5-10% strain) to 110 MPa (>40% strain). Despite this extreme strain softening, these fibers were very extensible, with a breaking strain of 100%. The fibers exhibited high energy loss (up to 70%) and strains larger than 5% permanently deformed the fibers. These fibers displayed the stress-strain curves of a ductile material. We provide a comparison of the mechanical properties of these blended fibers with other electrospun and natural nanofibers. This work expands a growing library of mechanically characterized, electrospun materials for biomedical applications.	
33349527        	Mesenchymal Niches for Digestive Organ Development, Homeostasis, and Disease.            	Mesenchymal-epithelial crosstalk plays a crucial role in organ development and stem cell function. However, the identity of the mesenchymal cells involved in this exchange was unclear. Recent significant advances in single-cell transcriptomics have defined the heterogeneity of these mesenchymal niches. By combining multiomic profiling, animal models, and organoid culture, new studies have not only demonstrated the roles of diverse mesenchymal cell populations but also defined the mechanisms underlying their regulation of niche signals. Focusing on several digestive organs, we describe how similar and diverse mesenchymal cell populations promote organ development and maintain proper stem cell activity, and how the heterogeneity of mesenchymal niches is altered in digestive diseases such as inflammation and cancer.

32542357        	Glucagon-like peptide 2 for intestinal stem cell and Paneth cell repair during graft-versus-host disease in mice and humans.            	Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Although currently used GVHD treatment regimens target the donor immune system, we explored here an approach that aims at protecting and regenerating Paneth cells (PCs) and intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Glucagon-like-peptide-2 (GLP-2) is an enteroendocrine tissue hormone produced by intestinal L cells. We observed that acute GVHD reduced intestinal GLP-2 levels in mice and patients developing GVHD. Treatment with the GLP-2 agonist, teduglutide, reduced de novo acute GVHD and steroid-refractory GVHD, without compromising graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in multiple mouse models. Mechanistically GLP-2 substitution promoted regeneration of PCs and ISCs, which enhanced production of antimicrobial peptides and caused microbiome changes. GLP-2 expanded intestinal organoids and reduced expression of apoptosis-related genes. Low numbers of L cells in intestinal biopsies and high serum levels of GLP-2 were associated with a higher incidence of nonrelapse mortality in patients undergoing allo-HCT. Our findings indicate that L cells are a target of GVHD and that GLP-2-based treatment of acute GVHD restores intestinal homeostasis via an increase of ISCs and PCs without impairing GVL effects. Teduglutide could become a novel combination partner for immunosuppressive GVHD therapy to be tested in clinical trials.	
32796887        	Regulation of colonic epithelial cell homeostasis by mTORC1.            	Cell signaling important for homeostatic regulation of colonic epithelial cells (CECs) remains poorly understood. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a protein complex that contains the serine-threonine kinase mTOR, mediates signaling that underlies the control of cellular functions such as proliferation and autophagy by various external stimuli. We here show that ablation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2), a negative regulator of mTORC1, specifically in intestinal epithelial cells of mice resulted in increased activity of mTORC1 of, as well as increased proliferative activity of, CECs. Such Tsc2 ablation also reduced the population of Lgr5-positive colonic stem cells and the expression of Wnt target genes in CECs. The stimulatory phosphorylation of the kinase Akt and inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β were both markedly decreased in the colon of the Tsc2 conditional knockout (CKO) mice. Development of colonic organoids with cryptlike structures was enhanced for Tsc2 CKO mice compared with control mice. Finally, Tsc2 CKO mice manifested increased susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Our results thus suggest that mTORC1 activity promotes the proliferation of, as well as the expression of Wnt target genes in, CECs and thereby contributes to colonic organogenesis and homeostasis.	
32781650        	Amelioration of Congenital Tufting Enteropathy in EpCAM (TROP1)-Deficient Mice via Heterotopic Expression of TROP2 in Intestinal Epithelial Cells.            	TROP1 (EpCAM) and TROP2 are homologous cell surface proteins that are widely expressed, and often co-expressed, in developing and adult epithelia. Various functions have been ascribed to EpCAM and TROP2, but responsible mechanisms are incompletely characterized and functional equivalence has not been examined. Adult intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) express high levels of EpCAM, while TROP2 is not expressed. EpCAM deficiency causes congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) in humans and a corresponding lethal condition in mice. We expressed TROP2 and EpCAM in the IEC of EpCAM-deficient mice utilizing a villin promoter to assess EpCAM and TROP2 function. Expression of EpCAM or TROP2 in the IEC of EpCAM knockout mice prevented CTE. TROP2 rescue (T2R) mice were smaller than controls, while EpCAM rescue (EpR) mice were not. Abnormalities were observed in the diameters and histology of T2R small intestine, and Paneth and stem cell markers were decreased. T2R mice also exhibited enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, enhanced permeability to 4 kDa FITC-dextran and increased sensitivity to detergent-induced colitis, consistent with compromised barrier function. Studies of IEC organoids and spheroids revealed that stem cell function was also compromised in T2R mice. We conclude that EpCAM and TROP2 exhibit functional redundancy, but they are not equivalent.	
31310810        	Convergence of human cellular models and genetics to study neural stem cell signaling to enhance central nervous system regeneration and repair.            	Human central nervous system (CNS) regeneration is considered the holy grail of neuroscience research, and is one of the most pressing and difficult questions in biology and science. Despite more than 20 years of work in the field of neural stem cells (NSCs), the area remains in its infancy as our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that can be leveraged to improve CNS regeneration in neurological diseases is still growing. Here, we focus on the recent lessons from lower organism CNS regeneration genetics and how such findings are starting to illuminate our understanding of NSC signaling pathways in humans. These findings will allow us to improve upon our knowledge of endogenous NSC function, the utility of exogenous NSCs, and the limitations of NSCs as therapeutic vehicles for providing relief from devastating human neurological diseases. We also discuss the limitations of activating NSC signaling for CNS repair in humans, especially the potential for tumor formation. Finally, we will review the recent advances in new culture techniques, including patient-derived cells and cerebral organoids to model the genetic regulation of signaling pathways controlling the function of NSCs during injury and disease states.

32317723        	Alternative macrophage polarisation associated with resistance to anti-PD1 blockade is possibly supported by the splicing of FKBP51 immunophilin in melanoma patients.            	FKBP51 immunophilin is abundantly expressed by immune cells. Co-inhibitory immune receptor signalling generates the splicing isoform FKBP51s. Tregs stained by FKBP51s are increased in melanoma patients and their counts are associated with anti-CTLA-4 response. An expansion of FKBP51s+PD-L1+ monocytes was measured in a group of non-responding patients to anti-CTLA-4. The aim of this work was to confirm the predictive value of response of FKBP51s+Tregs in a cohort of patients undergoing anti-PD1 treatment and shed light on a monocyte subset co-expressing PD-L1/FKBP51s.                Co-cultures of organoids and autologous lymphocytes were used to confirm that tumour T-cell interaction can induce FKBP51s. PBMC immunophenotype and flow cytometry served to assess and monitor FKBP51s+Treg and FKBP51s+PD-L1+ monocytes in 22 advanced melanoma patients treated with anti-PD1. Silencing and overexpression of FKBP51s in human macrophages served to address the protein role in the tolerant macrophages' behaviour.                FKBP51s+Tregs count was increased in responders and had a prognostic value. Non-responders showed an early increase in FKBP51s+ PD-L1+ monocytes during anti-PD1 treatment. Manipulation of FKBP51s modulated the macrophage-phenotype, with forced protein expression promoting aspects associated with tolerance.                FKBP51s may guide in the selection and monitoring of melanoma patient candidates to immune-checkpoint-targeted therapy. Manipulation of FKBP51s may overcome resistance.	
31666564        	Characterisation of proguanylin expressing cells in the intestine - evidence for constitutive luminal secretion.            	Guanylin, a peptide implicated in regulation of intestinal fluid secretion, is expressed in the mucosa, but the exact cellular origin remains controversial. In a new transgenic mouse model fluorescent reporter protein expression driven by the proguanylin promoter was observed throughout the small intestine and colon in goblet and Paneth(-like) cells and, except in duodenum, in mature enterocytes. In Ussing chamber experiments employing both human and mouse intestinal tissue, proguanylin was released predominantly in the luminal direction. Measurements of proguanylin expression and secretion in cell lines and organoids indicated that secretion is largely constitutive and requires ER to Golgi transport but was not acutely regulated by salt or other stimuli. Using a newly-developed proguanylin assay, we found plasma levels to be raised in humans after total gastrectomy or intestinal transplantation, but largely unresponsive to nutrient ingestion. By LC-MS/MS we identified processed forms in tissue and luminal extracts, but in plasma we only detected full-length proguanylin. Our transgenic approach provides information about the cellular origins of proguanylin, complementing previous immunohistochemical and in-situ hybridisation results. The identification of processed forms of proguanylin in the intestinal lumen but not in plasma supports the notion that the primary site of action is the gut itself.	
25762181        	Current challenges in clinical development of "targeted therapies": the case of acute myeloid leukemia.            	A fundamental difficulty in testing "targeted therapies" in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the limitations of preclinical models in capturing inter- and intrapatient genomic heterogeneity. Clinical trials typically focus on single agents despite the routine emergence of resistant subclones and experience in blast-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and acute promyelocytic leukemia arguing against this strategy. Inclusion of only relapsed-refractory, or unfit newly diagnosed, patients risks falsely negative results. There is uncertainty as to whether eligibility should require demonstration of the putative target and regarding therapeutic end points. Although use of in vivo preclinical models employing primary leukemic cells is first choice, newer preclinical models including "organoids" and combinations of pharmacologic and genetic approaches may better align models with human AML. We advocate earlier inclusion of combinations ± chemotherapy and of newly diagnosed patients into clinical trials. When a drug plausibly targets a pathway uniquely related to a specific genetic aberration, eligibility should begin with this subset, including patients with other malignancies, with subsequent extension to other patients. In other cases, a more open-minded approach to initial eligibility would facilitate quicker identification of responsive subsets. Complete remission without minimal residual disease seems a particularly useful short-term end point. Genotypic and phenotypic studies should be prespecified and performed routinely to distinguish responders from nonresponders.                 © 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.	
30002826        	Inflammation-induced DNA methylation of DNA polymerase gamma alters the metabolic profile of colon tumors.            	Inflammation, metabolism, and epigenetic modulation are highly interconnected processes that can be altered during tumorigenesis. However, because of the complexity of these interactions, direct cause and effect during tumorigenesis have been difficult to prove. Previously, using a murine model of inflammation-induced colon tumorigenesis, we determined that the promoter of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma (Polg) is DNA hypermethylated and silenced in inflammation-induced tumors, but not in non-inflammation-induced (mock) tumors, suggesting that inflammation can induce silencing of Polg through promoting DNA methylation during tumorigenesis. Polg is the only mitochondrial DNA polymerase and mutations in Polg cause mitochondrial diseases in humans. Because of the role of mitochondria in metabolism, we hypothesized that silencing of Polg in inflammation-induced tumors would result in these tumors having altered metabolism in comparison to mock tumors.                Inflammation-induced and mock colon tumors and colon epithelium from a mouse model of inflammation-induced colon tumorigenesis were assayed for alterations in Polg expression, mitochondria, and metabolism. Organoids derived from these tissues were used to study the direct effect of loss of Polg on mitochondria and metabolism.                We demonstrate that inflammation-induced tumors with reduced Polg expression have decreased mitochondrial DNA content and numbers of mitochondria compared to normal epithelium or mock tumors. Tumoroids derived from mock and inflammation-induced tumors retained key characteristics of the original tumors. Inflammation-induced tumoroids had increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion relative to mock tumoroids. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Polg in mock tumoroids reduced mtDNA content, increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion, and made the tumoroids more resistant to oxidative stress.                These results suggest that inflammation-induced DNA methylation and silencing of Polg plays an important role in the tumorigenesis process by resulting in reduced mitochondria levels and altered metabolism. An enhanced understanding of how metabolism is altered in and drives inflammation-induced tumorigenesis will provide potential therapeutic targets.	
24213466        	Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung.            	Neuroendocrine tumors may develop throughout the human body with the majority being found in the gastrointestinal tract and bronchopulmonary system. Neuroendocrine tumors are classified according to the grade of biological aggressiveness (G1-G3) and the extent of differentiation (well-differentiated/poorly-differentiated). The well-differentiated neoplasms comprise typical (G1) and atypical (G2) carcinoids. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas as well as small cell carcinomas (G3) are poorly-differentiated. The identification and differentiation of atypical from typical carcinoids or large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas and small cell carcinomas is essential for treatment options and prognosis. Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors are characterized according to the proportion of necrosis, the mitotic activity, palisading, rosette-like structure, trabecular pattern and organoid nesting. The given information about the histopathological assessment, classification, prognosis, genetic aberration as well as treatment options of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors are based on own experiences and reviewing the current literature available. Most disagreements among the classification of neuroendocrine tumor entities exist in the identification of typical versus atypical carcinoids, atypical versus large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas versus small cell carcinomas. Additionally, the classification is restricted in terms of limited specificity of immunohistochemical markers and possible artifacts in small biopsies which can be compressed in cytological specimens. Until now, pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors have been increasing in incidence. As compared to NSCLCs, only little research has been done with respect to new molecular targets as well as improving the classification and differential diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors of the lung.	
32482863        	Pivotal role of the transcriptional co-activator YAP in trophoblast stemness of the developing human placenta.            	Various pregnancy complications, such as severe forms of preeclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction, are thought to arise from failures in the differentiation of human placental trophoblasts. Progenitors of the latter either develop into invasive extravillous trophoblasts, remodeling the uterine vasculature, or fuse into multinuclear syncytiotrophoblasts transporting oxygen and nutrients to the growing fetus. However, key regulatory factors controlling trophoblast self-renewal and differentiation have been poorly elucidated. Using primary cells, three-dimensional organoids, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited JEG-3 clones, we herein show that YAP, the transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo signaling pathway, promotes maintenance of cytotrophoblast progenitors by different genomic mechanisms. Genetic or chemical manipulation of YAP in these cellular models revealed that it stimulates proliferation and expression of cell cycle regulators and stemness-associated genes, but inhibits cell fusion and production of syncytiotrophoblast (STB)-specific proteins, such as hCG and GDF15. Genome-wide comparisons of primary villous cytotrophoblasts overexpressing constitutively active YAP-5SA with YAP KO cells and syncytializing trophoblasts revealed common target genes involved in trophoblast stemness and differentiation. ChIP-qPCR unraveled that YAP-5SA overexpression increased binding of YAP-TEAD4 complexes to promoters of proliferation-associated genes such as CCNA and CDK6 Moreover, repressive YAP-TEAD4 complexes containing the histone methyltransferase EZH2 were detected in the genomic regions of the STB-specific CGB5 and CGB7 genes. In summary, YAP plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of the human placental trophoblast epithelium. Besides activating stemness factors, it also directly represses genes promoting trophoblast cell fusion.                Copyright © 2020 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.	
32270911        	IκBα deficiency imposes a fetal phenotype to intestinal stem cells.            	The intestinal epithelium is a paradigm of adult tissue in constant regeneration that is supported by intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The mechanisms regulating ISC homeostasis after injury are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that IκBα, the main regulator of NF-κB, exerts alternative nuclear functions as cytokine sensor in a subset of PRC2-regulated genes. Here, we show that nuclear IκBα is present in the ISC compartment. Mice deficient for IκBα show altered intestinal cell differentiation with persistence of a fetal-like ISC phenotype, associated with aberrant PRC2 activity at specific loci. Moreover, IκBα-deficient intestinal cells produce morphologically aberrant organoids carrying a PRC2-dependent fetal-like transcriptional signature. DSS treatment, which induces acute damage in the colonic epithelium of mice, results in a temporary loss of nuclear P-IκBα and its subsequent accumulation in early CD44-positive regenerating areas. Importantly, IκBα-deficient mice show higher resistance to damage, likely due to the persistent fetal-like ISC phenotype. These results highlight intestinal IκBα as a chromatin sensor of inflammation in the ISC compartment.                © 2020 The Authors.

22066102        	Fibrous hamartoma of infancy: an experience of a single institute.            	Fibrous hamartoma (FH) of infancy is a distinctive fibrous growth that most frequently occurs at birth and during the postnatal period. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize this entity to avoid an aggressive approach.                We herein describe the clinicopathologic features of 9 FHs diagnosed at a single institution between 1997 and 2010.                There were 7 boys and 2 girls, and the mean age of presentation was 14.7 months. The common locations were the lower back and gluteal region (n = 3) and scrotum (n = 2). They were solitary lesions, and measured 1.0 to 7.0 cm in maximum diameter (mean, 4.9 cm). The excised masses tended to be poorly circumscribed, and consisted of an intimate mixture of firm, gray-white tissue with fat. Histologically, these lesions were composed of 3 components forming a vague, irregular, organoid pattern: well-defined intersecting trabeculae of fibrocollagenous tissue; loosely textured areas of small, rounded, primitive mesenchymal cells; and mature fat. Over a median follow-up of 72 months, no patient showed recurrence.                FH should be distinguished from other forms of fibromatosis and malignant tumors because it is benign and usually cured by local excision.	
32333601        	Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the Gut of Patients With IBD.            	Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have intestinal inflammation and are treated with immune-modulating medications. In the face of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, we do not know whether patients with IBD will be more susceptible to infection or disease. We hypothesized that the viral entry molecules angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are expressed in the intestine. We further hypothesized that their expression could be affected by inflammation or medication usage.                We examined the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 by quantitative polymerase chain reacion in animal models of IBD. Publicly available data from organoids and mucosal biopsies from patients with IBD were examined for expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We conducted RNA sequencing for CD11b-enriched cells and peripheral and lamina propria T-cells from well-annotated patient samples.                ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundantly expressed in the ileum and colon and had high expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In animal models, inflammation led to downregulation of epithelial Ace2. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not increased in samples from patients with compared with those of control patients. In CD11b-enriched cells but not T-cells, the level of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the mucosa was comparable to other functional mucosal genes and was not affected by inflammation. Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and steroids were linked to significantly lower expression of ACE2 in CD11b-enriched cells.                The viral entry molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the ileum and colon. Patients with IBD do not have higher expression during inflammation; medical therapy is associated with lower levels of ACE2. These data provide reassurance for patients with IBD.                © 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.	
32019729        	Modulation of sulfur assimilation metabolic toxicity overcomes anemia and hemochromatosis in mice.            	Sulfur assimilation is an essential metabolic pathway that regulates sulfation, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide hydrolysis, and organismal homeostasis. We recently reported that mice lacking bisphosphate 3'-nucleotidase (BPNT1), a key regulator of sulfur assimilation, develop iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and anasarca. Here we demonstrate two approaches that successfully reduce metabolic toxicity caused by loss of BPNT1: 1) dietary methionine restriction and 2) overproduction of a key transcriptional regulator hypoxia inducible factor 2α (Hif-2a). Reduction of methionine in the diet reverses IDA in mice lacking BPNT1, through a mechanism of downregulation of sulfur assimilation metabolic toxicity. Gaining Hif-2a acts through a different mechanism by restoring iron homeostatic gene expression in BPNT1 deficient mouse intestinal organoids. Finally, as loss of BPNT1 impairs expression of known genetic modifiers of iron-overload, we demonstrate that intestinal-epithelium specific loss of BPNT1 attenuates hepatic iron accumulation in mice with homozygous C282Y mutations in homeostatic iron regulator (HFEC282Y), the most common cause of hemochromatosis in humans. Overall, our study uncovers genetic and dietary strategies to overcome anemia caused by defects in sulfur assimilation and identifies BPNT1 as a potential target for the treatment of hemochromatosis.

32153125        	Targeting the pregnane X receptor using microbial metabolite mimicry.            	The human PXR (pregnane X receptor), a master regulator of drug metabolism, has essential roles in intestinal homeostasis and abrogating inflammation. Existing PXR ligands have substantial off-target toxicity. Based on prior work that established microbial (indole) metabolites as PXR ligands, we proposed microbial metabolite mimicry as a novel strategy for drug discovery that allows exploiting previously unexplored parts of chemical space. Here, we report functionalized indole derivatives as first-in-class non-cytotoxic PXR agonists as a proof of concept for microbial metabolite mimicry. The lead compound, FKK6 (Felix Kopp Kortagere 6), binds directly to PXR protein in solution, induces PXR-specific target gene expression in cells, human organoids, and mice. FKK6 significantly represses pro-inflammatory cytokine production cells and abrogates inflammation in mice expressing the human PXR gene. The development of FKK6 demonstrates for the first time that microbial metabolite mimicry is a viable strategy for drug discovery and opens the door to underexploited regions of chemical space.                © 2020 The Authors.

32642659        	The soluble form of pan-RTK inhibitor and tumor suppressor LRIG1 mediates downregulation of AXL through direct protein-protein interaction in glioblastoma.            	Targeted approaches for inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in glioblastoma (GBM) have led to therapeutic resistance and little clinical benefit, raising the need for the development of alternative strategies. Endogenous LRIG1 (Leucine-rich Repeats and ImmunoGlobulin-like domains protein 1) is an RTK inhibitory protein required for stem cell maintenance, and we previously demonstrated the soluble ectodomain of LRIG1 (sLRIG1) to potently inhibit GBM growth in vitro and in vivo.                Here, we generated a recombinant protein of the ectodomain of LRIG1 (sLRIG1) and determined its activity in various cellular GBM models including patient-derived stem-like cells and patient organoids. We used proliferation, adhesion, and invasion assays, and performed gene and protein expression studies. Proximity ligation assay and NanoBiT complementation technology were applied to assess protein-protein interactions.                We show that recombinant sLRIG1 downregulates EGFRvIII but not EGFR, and reduces proliferation in GBM cells, irrespective of their EGFR expression status. We find that sLRIG1 targets and downregulates a wide range of RTKs, including AXL, and alters GBM cell adhesion. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that LRIG1 interferes with AXL but not with EGFR dimerization.                These results identify AXL as a novel sLRIG1 target and show that LRIG1-mediated RTK downregulation depends on direct protein interaction. The pan-RTK inhibitory activity of sLRIG1 warrants further investigation for new GBM treatment approaches.                © The Author(s) 2019.

31292548        	Notum produced by Paneth cells attenuates regeneration of aged intestinal epithelium.            	A decline in stem cell function impairs tissue regeneration during ageing, but the role of the stem-cell-supporting niche in ageing is not well understood. The small intestine is maintained by actively cycling intestinal stem cells that are regulated by the Paneth cell niche1,2. Here we show that the regenerative potential of human and mouse intestinal epithelium diminishes with age owing to defects in both stem cells and their niche. The functional decline was caused by a decrease in stemness-maintaining Wnt signalling due to production of Notum, an extracellular Wnt inhibitor, in aged Paneth cells. Mechanistically, high activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in aged Paneth cells inhibits activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPAR-α)3, and lowered PPAR-α activity increased Notum expression. Genetic targeting of Notum or Wnt supplementation restored function of aged intestinal organoids. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of Notum in mice enhanced the regenerative capacity of aged stem cells and promoted recovery from chemotherapy-induced damage. Our results reveal a role of the stem cell niche in ageing and demonstrate that targeting of Notum can promote regeneration of aged tissues.	
27242966        	Galectin-3 Determines Tumor Cell Adaptive Strategies in Stressed Tumor Microenvironments.            	Galectin-3 is a member of the β-galactoside-binding lectin family, whose expression is often dysregulated in cancers. While galectin-3 is usually an intracellular protein found in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, under certain conditions, galectin-3 can be secreted by an yet unknown mechanism. Under stressing conditions (e.g., hypoxia and nutrient deprivation) galectin-3 is upregulated, through the activity of transcription factors, such as HIF-1α and NF-κB. Here, we review evidence that indicates a positive role for galectin-3 in MAPK family signal transduction, leading to cell proliferation and cell survival. Galectin-3 serves as a scaffold protein, which favors the spatial organization of signaling proteins as K-RAS. Upon secretion, extracellular galectin-3 interacts with a variety of cell surface glycoproteins, such as growth factor receptors, integrins, cadherins, and members of the Notch family, among other glycoproteins, besides different extracellular matrix molecules. Through its ability to oligomerize, galectin-3 forms lectin lattices that act as scaffolds that sustain the spatial organization of signaling receptors on the cell surface, dictating its maintenance on the plasma membrane or their endocytosis. Galectin-3 induces tumor cell, endothelial cell, and leukocyte migration, favoring either the exit of tumor cells from a stressed microenvironment or the entry of endothelial cells and leukocytes, such as monocytes/macrophages into the tumor organoid. Therefore, galectin-3 plays homeostatic roles in tumors, as (i) it favors tumor cell adaptation for survival in stressed conditions; (ii) upon secretion, galectin-3 induces tumor cell detachment and migration; and (iii) it attracts monocyte/macrophage and endothelial cells to the tumor mass, inducing both directly and indirectly the process of angiogenesis. The two latter activities are potentially targetable, and specific interventions may be designed to counteract the protumoral role of extracellular galectin-3.	
31638145        	Acetylation of ezrin regulates membrane-cytoskeleton interaction underlying CCL18-elicited cell migration.            	Ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein, plays an essential role in cell polarity establishment, cell migration, and division. Recent studies show that ezrin phosphorylation regulates breast cancer metastasis by promoting cancer cell survivor and promotes intrahepatic metastasis via cell migration. However, it was less characterized whether there are additional post-translational modifications and/or post-translational crosstalks on ezrin underlying context-dependent breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Here we show that ezrin is acetylated by p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) in breast cancer cells in response to CCL18 stimulation. Ezrin physically interacts with PCAF and is a cognate substrate of PCAF. The acetylation site of ezrin was mapped by mass spectrometric analyses, and dynamic acetylation of ezrin is essential for CCL18-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, the acetylation reduced the lipid-binding activity of ezrin to ensure a robust and dynamic cycling between the plasma membrane and cytosol in response to CCL18 stimulation. Biochemical analyses show that ezrin acetylation prevents the phosphorylation of Thr567. Using atomic force microscopic measurements, our study revealed that acetylation of ezrin induced its unfolding into a dominant structure, which prevents ezrin phosphorylation at Thr567. Thus, these results present a previously undefined mechanism by which CCL18-elicited crosstalks between the acetylation and phosphorylation on ezrin control breast cancer cell migration and invasion. This suggests that targeting PCAF signaling could be a potential therapeutic strategy for combating hyperactive ezrin-driven cancer progression.                © The Author(s) (2019).

30836137        	Base editing the mammalian genome.            	Base editing is a powerful technology that enables programmable conversion of single nucleotides in the mammalian genome. Base editors consist of a partially active Cas9 nuclease (Cas9D10A) tethered to a natural or synthetic DNA modifying enzyme. Though only recently described, BE has already shown enormous potential for basic and translational research, allowing the creation or repair of disease alleles in a variety of cell types and model organisms. In the past 2 years, a vast array of new and modified base editor variants have been described, expanding the flexibility and usefulness of the approach. Though simple in concept, effective implementation of base editing requires an understanding of the advantages and limitations of each of these tools. Here, we provide an overview of the concepts of DNA base editing, and discuss the recent progress toward the development of optimized base editing systems for mammalian cells. In addition, we highlight key technical aspects of designing and executing BE experiments, and provide detailed experimental examples of successful base editing in cell lines and organoids to help guide the effective use of these tools for genome modification.

33585126        	Clinicopathological Features of Primary Neuroendocrine Tumors of Gastrointestinal/Pancreatobiliary Tract With Emphasis on High-Grade (Grade 3) Well-Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors.            	Introduction The two broad subcategories of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WDNETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PDNECs), based on tumor architecture and cytology. Grade 3 WDNETs are a subset of WDNETs that not only are high grade by mitotic activity or proliferative index but exhibit a well-differentiated histology. In this study, we evaluated the clinicopathological features of primary neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI)/pancreatobiliary tract with emphasis on high-grade WDNETs, as it is a newly defined entity. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study, including a total number of 122 cases of primary GI and pancreatobiliary tract NENs. Slides and blocks of all cases were retrieved from the departmental archives. Immunohistochemical stains including Ki67 were applied to selected tissue blocks of all cases. Tumors were then evaluated for their histological differentiation and tumor grade. Results Our results showed that the mean age of patients was 46.8 ± 17.1 years. Majority of the NENs were GI tract origin (86.9%). The most common site of tumor in gastroenteropancreatic tract was the small bowel (31.1%), followed by the stomach (26.2%). Ninety five percent of the tumors were WDNETs, of which the most common grade was G2. The mean Ki67 index was 15.8 ± 23.8. Grade 3 WDNETs were noted to have an older mean age than grades 1 and 2 WDNETs. Ten out of 102 (9.8%) WDNETs of GI tract were grade 3, compared with four out of 14 (28.6%) of pancreatobiliary tract.  Conclusion In this study, we found that high-grade (grade 3) WDNETs were more frequent in pancreatobiliary tract than GI tract. Moreover, high-grade WDNETs were associated with a higher mean age than low-grade (grade 1-2) WDNETs. It is extremely important to recognize this subset (high grade) of WDNETs and to distinguish it from PDNECs, as the latter are known to be associated with a worse overall survival. Despite high mitotic rate/proliferative index, high-grade WDNETs are characterized by organoid architecture and monomorphic cell population.                Copyright © 2021, Hashmi et al.	
31130357        	Nestin+NG2+ Cells Form a Reserve Stem Cell Population in the Mouse Prostate.            	In the prostate, stem and progenitor cell regenerative capacities have been ascribed to both basal and luminal epithelial cells. Here, we show that a rare subset of mesenchymal cells in the prostate are epithelial-primed Nestin-expressing cells (EPNECs) that can generate self-renewing prostate organoids with bipotential capacity. Upon transplantation, these EPNECs can form prostate gland tissue grafts at the clonal level. Lineage-tracing analyses show that cells marked by Nestin or NG2 transgenic mice contribute to prostate epithelium during organogenesis. In the adult, modest contributions in repeated rounds of regression and regeneration are observed, whereas prostate epithelial cells derived from Nestin/NG2-marked cells are dramatically increased after severe irradiation-induced organ damage. These results indicate that Nestin/NG2 expression marks a novel radioresistant prostate stem cell that is active during development and displays reserve stem cell activity for tissue maintenance.

27304916        	Derivation of Diverse Hormone-Releasing Pituitary Cells from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.            	Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an unlimited cell source for regenerative medicine. Hormone-producing cells are particularly suitable for cell therapy, and hypopituitarism, a defect in pituitary gland function, represents a promising therapeutic target. Previous studies have derived pituitary lineages from mouse and human ESCs using 3D organoid cultures that mimic the complex events underlying pituitary gland development in vivo. Instead of relying on unknown cellular signals, we present a simple and efficient strategy to derive human pituitary lineages from hPSCs using monolayer culture conditions suitable for cell manufacturing. We demonstrate that purified placode cells can be directed into pituitary fates using defined signals. hPSC-derived pituitary cells show basal and stimulus-induced hormone release in vitro and engraftment and hormone release in vivo after transplantation into a murine model of hypopituitarism. This work lays the foundation for future cell therapy applications in patients with hypopituitarism.                Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	
31954883        	SIRT2 Contributes to the Regulation of Intestinal Cell Proliferation and Differentiation.            	Intestinal mucosa undergoes a continual process of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Disruption of this homeostasis is associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated the role of Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation and differentiation and the mechanism by which SIRT2 contributes to maintenance of intestinal cell homeostasis.                IECs were collected from SIRT2-deficient mice and patients with IBD. Expression of SIRT2, differentiation markers (mucin2, intestinal alkaline phosphatase, villin, Na,K-ATPase, and lysozyme) and Wnt target genes (EPHB2, AXIN2, and cyclin D1) was determined by western blot, real-time RT-PCR, or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. IECs were treated with TNF or transfected with siRNA targeting SIRT2. Proliferation was determined by villus height and crypt depth, and Ki67 and cyclin D1 IHC staining. For studies using organoids, intestinal crypts were isolated.                Increased SIRT2 expression was localized to the more differentiated region of the intestine. In contrast, SIRT2 deficiency impaired proliferation and differentiation and altered stemness in the small intestinal epithelium ex vivo and in vivo. SIRT2-deficient mice showed decreased intestinal enterocyte and goblet cell differentiation but increased the Paneth cell lineage and increased proliferation of IECs. Moreover, we found that SIRT2 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which critically regulates IEC proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with a distinct role for SIRT2 in maintenance of gut homeostasis, intestinal mucosa from IBD patients exhibited decreased SIRT2 expression.                We demonstrate that SIRT2, which is decreased in intestinal tissues from IBD patients, regulates Wnt-β-catenin signaling and is important for maintenance of IEC proliferation and differentiation.

31067471        	The Ion Transporter NKCC1 Links Cell Volume to Cell Mass Regulation by Suppressing mTORC1.            	mTORC1 regulates cellular growth and is activated by growth factors and by essential amino acids such as Leu. Leu enters cells via the Leu transporter LAT1-4F2hc (LAT1). Here we show that the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter NKCC1 (SLC12A2), a known regulator of cell volume, is present in complex with LAT1. We further show that NKCC1 depletion or deletion enhances LAT1 activity, as well as activation of Akt and Erk, leading to activation of mTORC1 in cells, colonic organoids, and mouse colon. Moreover, NKCC1 depletion reduces intracellular Na+ concentration and cell volume (size) and mass and stimulates cell proliferation. NKCC1, therefore, suppresses mTORC1 by inhibiting its key activating signaling pathways. Importantly, by linking ion transport and cell volume regulation to mTORC1 function, NKCC1 provides a long-sought link connecting cell volume (size) to cell mass regulation.

30886357        	Determinants of Zika virus host tropism uncovered by deep mutational scanning.            	Arboviruses cycle between, and replicate in, both invertebrate and vertebrate hosts, which for Zika virus (ZIKV) involves Aedes mosquitoes and primates1. The viral determinants required for replication in such obligate hosts are under strong purifying selection during natural virus evolution, making it challenging to resolve which determinants are optimal for viral fitness in each host. Herein we describe a deep mutational scanning (DMS) strategy2-5 whereby a viral cDNA library was constructed containing all codon substitutions in the C-terminal 204 amino acids of ZIKV envelope protein (E). The cDNA library was transfected into C6/36 (Aedes) and Vero (primate) cells, with subsequent deep sequencing and computational analyses of recovered viruses showing that substitutions K316Q and S461G, or Q350L and T397S, conferred substantial replicative advantages in mosquito and primate cells, respectively. A 316Q/461G virus was constructed and shown to be replication-defective in mammalian cells due to severely compromised virus particle formation and secretion. The 316Q/461G virus was also highly attenuated in human brain organoids, and illustrated utility as a vaccine in mice. This approach can thus imitate evolutionary selection in a matter of days and identify amino acids key to the regulation of virus replication in specific host environments.	
31327863        	Regulation of Small Intestinal Epithelial Homeostasis by Tsc2-mTORC1 Signaling.            	Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a protein complex containing the serine/threonine kinase mTOR, integrates various growth stimulating signals. mTORC1 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), whereas the physiological roles of this protein complex in homeostasis of IECs remain virtually unknown. We here generated mice, in which tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2), a negative regulator of mTORC1, was specifically ablated in IECs (Tsc2 CKO mice). Ablation of Tsc2 enhanced the phosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream molecules such as ribosomal S6 protein and 4E-BP1 in IECs. Tsc2 CKO mice manifested the enhanced proliferative activity of IECs in intestinal crypts as well as the promoted migration of these cells along the crypt-villus axis. The mutant mice also manifested the increased apoptotic rate of IECs as well as the increased ectopic Paneth cells, which are one of the major differentiated IECs. In addition, in vitro study showed that ablation of Tsc2 promoted the development of intestinal organoids without epidermal growth factor, while mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, diminished this phenotype. Our results thus suggest that Tsc2-mTORC1 signaling regulates the proliferation, migration, and positioning of IECs, and thereby contributes to the proper regulation of intestinal homeostasis.	
26492922        	Nkx2.2 is expressed in a subset of enteroendocrine cells with expanded lineage potential.            	There are two major stem cell populations in the intestinal crypt region that express either Bmi1 or Lgr5; however, it has been shown that other populations in the crypt can regain stemness. In this study, we demonstrate that the transcription factor NK2 homeobox 2 (Nkx2.2) is expressed in enteroendocrine cells located in the villus and crypt of the intestinal epithelium and is coexpressed with the stem cell markers Bmi1 and Lgr5 in a subset of crypt cells. To determine whether Nkx2.2-expressing enteroendocrine cells display cellular plasticity and stem cell potential, we performed genetic lineage tracing of the Nkx2.2-expressing population using Nkx2.2(Cre/+);R26RTomato mice. These studies demonstrated that Nkx2.2+ cells are able to give rise to all intestinal epithelial cell types in basal conditions. The proliferative capacity of Nkx2.2-expressing cells was also demonstrated in vitro using crypt organoid cultures. Injuring the intestine with irradiation, systemic inflammation, and colitis did not enhance the lineage potential of Nkx2.2-expressing cells. These findings demonstrate that a rare mature enteroendocrine cell subpopulation that is demarcated by Nkx2.2 expression display stem cell properties during normal intestinal epithelial homeostasis, but is not easily activated upon injury.

30766894        	Novel Chimeric Gene Therapy Vectors Based on Adeno-Associated Virus and Four Different Mammalian Bocaviruses.            	Parvoviruses are highly attractive templates for the engineering of safe, efficient, and specific gene therapy vectors, as best exemplified by adeno-associated virus (AAV). Another candidate that currently garners increasing attention is human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1). Notably, HBoV1 capsids can cross-package recombinant (r)AAV2 genomes, yielding rAAV2/HBoV1 chimeras that specifically transduce polarized human airway epithelia (pHAEs). Here, we largely expanded the repertoire of rAAV/BoV chimeras, by assembling packaging plasmids encoding the capsid genes of four additional primate bocaviruses, HBoV2-4 and GBoV (Gorilla BoV). Capsid protein expression and efficient rAAV cross-packaging were validated by immunoblotting and qPCR, respectively. Interestingly, not only HBoV1 but also HBoV4 and GBoV transduced pHAEs as well as primary human lung organoids. Flow cytometry analysis of pHAEs revealed distinct cellular specificities between the BoV isolates, with HBoV1 targeting ciliated, club, and KRT5+ basal cells, whereas HBoV4 showed a preference for KRT5+ basal cells. Surprisingly, primary human hepatocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and T cells were also highly amenable to rAAV/BoV transduction. Finally, we adapted our pipeline for AAV capsid gene shuffling to all five BoV isolates. Collectively, our chimeric rAAV/BoV vectors and bocaviral capsid library represent valuable new resources to dissect BoV biology and to breed unique gene therapy vectors.	
33551833        	CSF3 Is a Potential Drug Target for the Treatment of COVID-19.            	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease that appeared at the end of 2019. As of July 2020, the cumulative number of infections and deaths have exceeded 15 million and 630,000, respectively. And new cases are increasing. There are still many difficulties surrounding research on the mechanism and development of therapeutic vaccines. It is urgent to explore the pathogenic mechanism of viruses to help prevent and treat COVID-19. In our study, we downloaded two datasets related to COVID-19 (GSE150819 and GSE147507). By analyzing the high-throughput expression matrix of uninfected human bronchial organoids and infected human bronchial organoids in the GSE150819, 456 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, which were mainly enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and so on. We also constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs to identify the hub genes. Then we analyzed GSE147507, which contained lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 and Calu3) and the primary bronchial epithelial cell line (NHBE), obtaining 799, 460, and 46 DEGs, respectively. The results showed that in human bronchial organoids, A549, Calu3, and NHBE samples infected with SARS-CoV-2, only one upregulated gene CSF3 was identified. Interestingly, CSF3 is one of the hub genes we previously screened in GSE150819, suggesting that CSF3 may be a potential drug target. Further, we screened potential drugs targeting CSF3 by MOE; the top 50 drugs were screened by flexible docking and rigid docking, with 37 intersections. Two antiviral drugs (Elbasvir and Ritonavir) were included; Elbasvir and Ritonavir formed van der Waals (VDW) interactions with surrounding residues to bind with CSF3, and Elbasvir and Ritonavir significantly inhibited CSF3 protein expression.

23337963        	[Congenital nevi in childhood].            	Nevi represent congenital hamartomatous malformations of various components of the skin. The most common forms are congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) and nevi of epithelial origin (epidermal and organoid nevi). Large CMN in particular can lead to severe complications and the management of those affected represents a challenge from birth. In contrast to previous assumptions, the risk of malignancy from CMN is considered to be relatively low however, this may be relevantly increased in certain situations. Possible extracutaneous symptoms in cases of central nervous system (CNS) involvement should not be underestimated and early imaging investigations are part of the routine diagnostic procedure. Surgical measures are still very important in the treatment of CMN but the indications must be weighed up for each individual case. Patients often experience marked stigmatization due to disfigurement by their birthmark and this needs to be taken into consideration for their treatment. The most common epithelial nevi are sebaceous nevi. In 2-13 % of cases additional tumors occur within this nevus and early surgical excision is indicated in most cases, not least for aesthetic reasons. If generalized spreading of epidermal nevi occurs, additional investigations are necessary to exclude associated ophthalmological, cardiac or neurological malformations.	
30209212        	Elevated A20 promotes TNF-induced and RIPK1-dependent intestinal epithelial cell death.            	Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death is a common feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that triggers inflammation by compromising barrier integrity. In many patients with IBD, epithelial damage and inflammation are TNF-dependent. Elevated TNF production in IBD is accompanied by increased expression of the TNFAIP3 gene, which encodes A20, a negative feedback regulator of NF-κB. A20 in intestinal epithelium from patients with IBD coincided with the presence of cleaved caspase-3, and A20 transgenic (Tg) mice, in which A20 is expressed from an IEC-specific promoter, were highly susceptible to TNF-induced IEC death, intestinal damage, and shock. A20-expressing intestinal organoids were also susceptible to TNF-induced death, demonstrating that enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis was a cell-autonomous property of A20. This effect was dependent on Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (RIPK1) activity, and A20 was found to associate with the Ripoptosome complex, potentiating its ability to activate caspase-8. A20-potentiated RIPK1-dependent apoptosis did not require the A20 deubiquitinase (DUB) domain and zinc finger 4 (ZnF4), which mediate NF-κB inhibition in fibroblasts, but was strictly dependent on ZnF7 and A20 dimerization. We suggest that A20 dimers bind linear ubiquitin to stabilize the Ripoptosome and potentiate its apoptosis-inducing activity.	
21258428        	Amphiregulin mediates estrogen, progesterone, and EGFR signaling in the normal rat mammary gland and in hormone-dependent rat mammary cancers.            	Both estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) are implicated in the etiology of human breast cancer. Defining their mechanisms of action, particularly in vivo, is relevant to the prevention and therapy of breast cancer. We investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms of E and/or P-induced in vivo proliferation, in the normal rat mammary gland and in hormone-dependent rat mammary cancers which share many characteristics with the normal human breast and hormone-dependent breast cancers. We show that E+P treatment induced significantly greater proliferation in both the normal gland and mammary cancers compared to E alone. In both the normal gland and tumors, E+P-induced proliferation was mediated through the increased production of amphiregulin (Areg), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, and the activation of intracellular signaling pathways (Erk, Akt, JNK) downstream of EGFR that regulate proliferation. In vitro experiments using rat primary mammary organoids or T47D breast cancer cells confirmed that Areg and the synthetic progestin, R5020, synergize to promote cell proliferation through EGFR signaling. Iressa, an EGFR inhibitor, effectively blocked this proliferation. These results indicate that mediators of cross talk between E, P, and EGFR pathways may be considered as relevant molecular targets for the therapy of hormone-dependent breast cancers, especially in premenopausal women.                © The Author(s) 2010.

22025017        	Organotypic collagen I assay: a malleable platform to assess cell behaviour in a 3-dimensional context.            	Cell migration is fundamental to many aspects of biology, including development, wound healing, the cellular responses of the immune system, and metastasis of tumor cells. Migration has been studied on glass coverslips in order to make cellular dynamics amenable to investigation by light microscopy. However, it has become clear that many aspects of cell migration depend on features of the local environment including its elasticity, protein composition, and pore size, which are not faithfully represented by rigid two dimensional substrates such as glass and plastic. Furthermore, interaction with other cell types, including stromal fibroblasts and immune cells, has been shown to play a critical role in promoting the invasion of cancer cells. Investigation at the molecular level has increasingly shown that molecular dynamics, including response to drug treatment, of identical cells are significantly different when compared in vitro and in vivo. Ideally, it would be best to study cell migration in its naturally occurring context in living organisms, however this is not always possible. Intermediate tissue culture systems, such as cell derived matrix, matrigel, organotypic culture (described here) tissue explants, organoids, and xenografts, are therefore important experimental intermediates. These systems approximate certain aspects of an in vivo environment but are more amenable to experimental manipulation such as use of stably transfected cell lines, drug treatment regimes, long term and high-resolution imaging. Such intermediate systems are especially useful as proving grounds to validate probes and establish parameters required to image the dynamic response of cells and fluorescent reporters prior to undertaking imaging in vivo. As such, they can serve an important role in reducing the need for experiments on living animals.

Prostate stem cells (P-SCs) are capable of giving rise to all three lineages of prostate epithelial cells, which include basal, luminal, and neuroendocrine cells. Two types of P-SCs have been identified in both human and mouse adult prostates based on prostasphere or organoid cultures, cell lineage tracing, renal capsule implantation, and expression of luminal- and basal-specific proteins. The sphere-forming P-SCs are from the basal cell compartment that express P63, and are therefore designated as basal P-SCs (P-bSCs). Luminal P-SCs (P-lSCs) express luminal cytokeratins and Nkx3.1. Herein, we report that the type 2 FGF receptor (FGFR2) signaling axis is crucial for preserving stemness and preventing differentiation of P-bSCs. FGFR2 signaling mediated by FGFR substrate 2α (FRS2α) is indispensable for formation and maintenance of prostaspheres derived from P63(+) P-bSCs. Ablation of Fgfr2 in P63(+) cells in vitro causes the disintegration of prostaspheres. Ablation of Fgfr2 in vivo reduces the number of P63-expressing basal cells and enriches luminal cells. This suggests a basal stem cell-to-luminal cell differentiation. In addition, ablation of Fgfr2 in P63(+) cells causes defective postnatal development of the prostate. Therefore, the data indicate that FGFR2 signaling is critical for preserving stemness and preventing differentiation of P-bSCs.                 © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.	
23744940        	Growing self-organizing mini-guts from a single intestinal stem cell: mechanism and applications.            	Recent examples have highlighted how stem cells have the capability to initiate morphogenesis in vitro; that is, to generate complex structures in culture that closely parallel their in vivo counterparts. Lgr5, the receptor for the Wnt-agonistic R-spondins, marks stem cells in multiple adult organs of mice and humans. In R-spondin-based three-dimensional cultures, these Lgr5 stem cells can grow into ever-expanding epithelial organoids that retain their original organ identity. Single Lgr5 stem cells derived from the intestine can be cultured to build epithelial structures that retain hallmarks of the in vivo epithelium. Here, we review the mechanisms that support this notable example of self-organization and discuss applications of this technology for stem cell research, disease modeling (e.g., for colorectal cancer and cystic fibrosis), and regenerative medicine.	
22200004        	Permselectivity Replication of Artificial Glomerular Basement Membranes in Nanoporous Collagen Multilayers.            	Basement membranes (BMs) play important roles in many biological functions such as tissue regeneration, cancer proliferation, nutrient/drug delivery, breathing, and many others. While there are many theoretical models, adequate experimental analogs of BMs describing basic physicochemical properties of BM, such as diffusion and permselectivity are not available. Taking BMs found in glomerulus of kidneys as an example, adequate reproduction of their permselectivity requires biomimetic membranes with submicron thickness, high uniformity, nanoscale porosity, and size-selective permeability. Artificial kidney BMs were assembled from poly(acrylic acid) and collagen using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technology and display multiple structural similarities with glomerular BMs. Diffusional transport through the artificial BMs faithfully replicate cut-off parameters of kidney membranes. Their utilization in understanding of unique diffusion processes in kidneys, in vitro studies of blood clearance time of small drugs/nanoscale drug carriers and design of more complex organoids including live cells for cancer proliferation studies is anticipated.	
29596476        	The colonic epithelium plays an active role in promoting colitis by shaping the tissue cytokine profile.            	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition driven by loss of homeostasis between the mucosal immune system, the commensal gut microbiota, and the intestinal epithelium. Our goal is to understand how these components of the intestinal ecosystem cooperate to control homeostasis. By combining quantitative measures of epithelial hyperplasia and immune infiltration with multivariate analysis of inter- and intracellular signaling, we identified epithelial mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as a potential driver of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. A kinetic analysis of mTOR inhibition revealed that the pathway regulates epithelial differentiation, which in turn controls the cytokine milieu of the colon. Consistent with our in vivo analysis, we found that cytokine expression of organoids grown ex vivo, in the absence of bacteria and immune cells, was dependent on differentiation state. Our study suggests that proper differentiation of epithelial cells is an important feature of colonic homeostasis because of its effect on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.	
25892522        	Frizzled7 functions as a Wnt receptor in intestinal epithelial Lgr5(+) stem cells.            	The mammalian adult small intestinal epithelium is a rapidly self-renewing tissue that is maintained by a pool of cycling stem cells intermingled with Paneth cells at the base of crypts. These crypt base stem cells exclusively express Lgr5 and require Wnt3 or, in its absence, Wnt2b. However, the Frizzled (Fzd) receptor that transmits these Wnt signals is unknown. We determined the expression profile of Fzd receptors in Lgr5(+) stem cells, their immediate daughter cells, and Paneth cells. Here we show Fzd7 is enriched in Lgr5(+) stem cells and binds Wnt3 and Wnt2b. Conditional deletion of the Fzd7 gene in adult intestinal epithelium leads to stem cell loss in vivo and organoid death in vitro. Crypts of conventional Fzd7 knockout mice show decreased basal Wnt signaling and impaired capacity to regenerate the epithelium following deleterious insult. These observations indicate that Fzd7 is required for robust Wnt-dependent processes in Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells.                Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

23388061        	Insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling increases proliferation and hyperplasia of the ovarian surface epithelium and decreases follicular integrity through upregulation of the PI3-kinase pathway.            	The ovarian surface epithelium responds to cytokines and hormonal cues to initiate proliferation and migration following ovulation. Although insulin and IGF are potent proliferative factors for the ovarian surface epithelium and IGF is required for follicle development, increased insulin and IGF activity are correlated with at least two gynecologic conditions: polycystic ovary syndrome and epithelial ovarian cancer. Although insulin and IGF are often components of in vitro culture media, little is known about the effects that these growth factors may have on the ovarian surface epithelium morphology or how signaling in the ovarian surface may affect follicular health and development.                Ovaries from CD1 mice were cultured in alginate hydrogels in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml insulin or IGF-I, as well as small molecule inhibitors of IR/IGF1R, PI 3-kinase signaling, or MAPK signaling. Tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for expression of cytokeratin 8 to mark the ovarian surface epithelium, Müllerian inhibiting substance to mark secondary follicles, and BrdU incorporation to assess proliferation. Changes in gene expression in the ovarian surface epithelium in response to insulin or IGF-I were analyzed by transcription array. Extracellular matrix organization was evaluated by expression and localization of collagen IV.                Culture of ovarian organoids with insulin or IGF-I resulted in formation of hyperplastic OSE approximately 4-6 cell layers thick with a high rate of proliferation, as well as decreased MIS expression in secondary follicles. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway restored MIS expression reduced by insulin but only partially restored normal OSE growth and morphology. Inhibition of the PI 3-kinase pathway restored MIS expression reduced by IGF-I and restored OSE growth to a single cell layer. Insulin and IGF-I altered organization of collagen IV, which was restored by inhibition of PI 3-kinase signaling.                While insulin and IGF are often required for propagation of primary cells, these cytokines may act as potent mitogens to disrupt cell growth, resulting in formation of hyperplastic OSE and decreased follicular integrity as measured by MIS expression and collagen deposition. This may be due partly to altered collagen IV deposition and organization in the ovary in response to insulin and IGF signaling mediated by PI 3-kinase.	
25840590        	Telomere dysfunction causes alveolar stem cell failure.            	Telomere syndromes have their most common manifestation in lung disease that is recognized as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. In both conditions, there is loss of alveolar integrity, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. We tested the capacity of alveolar epithelial and stromal cells from mice with short telomeres to support alveolar organoid colony formation and found that type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s), the stem cell-containing population, were limiting. When telomere dysfunction was induced in adult AEC2s by conditional deletion of the shelterin component telomeric repeat-binding factor 2, cells survived but remained dormant and showed all the hallmarks of cellular senescence. Telomere dysfunction in AEC2s triggered an immune response, and this was associated with AEC2-derived up-regulation of cytokine signaling pathways that are known to provoke inflammation in the lung. Mice uniformly died after challenge with bleomycin, underscoring an essential role for telomere function in AEC2s for alveolar repair. Our data show that alveoloar progenitor senescence is sufficient to recapitulate the regenerative defects, inflammatory responses, and susceptibility to injury that are characteristic of telomere-mediated lung disease. They suggest alveolar stem cell failure is a driver of telomere-mediated lung disease and that efforts to reverse it may be clinically beneficial.

29118367        	Impaired oxidative stress response characterizes HUWE1-promoted X-linked intellectual disability.            	Mutations in the HECT, UBA and WWE domain-containing 1 (HUWE1) E3 ubiquitin ligase cause neurodevelopmental disorder X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). HUWE1 regulates essential processes such as genome integrity maintenance. Alterations in the genome integrity and accumulation of mutations have been tightly associated with the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders. Though HUWE1 mutations are clearly implicated in XLID and HUWE1 regulatory functions well explored, currently much is unknown about the molecular basis of HUWE1-promoted XLID. Here we showed that the HUWE1 expression is altered and mutation frequency increased in three different XLID individual (HUWE1 p.R2981H, p.R4187C and HUWE1 duplication) cell lines. The effect was most prominent in HUWE1 p.R4187C XLID cells and was accompanied with decreased DNA repair capacity and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Analysis of HUWE1 substrates revealed XLID-specific down-regulation of oxidative stress response DNA polymerase (Pol) λ caused by hyperactive HUWE1 p.R4187C. The subsequent restoration of Polλ levels counteracted the oxidative hypersensitivity. The observed alterations in the genome integrity maintenance may be particularly relevant in the cortical progenitor zones of human brain, as suggested by HUWE1 immunofluorescence analysis of cerebral organoids. These results provide evidence that impairments of the fundamental cellular processes, like genome integrity maintenance, characterize HUWE1-promoted XLID.	
28829672        	Growth Differentiation Factor 11 does not Mitigate the Lethal Effects of Total-Abdominal Irradiation.            	Total-body exposure to radiation causes widespread tissue injury. Damage to the hematopoietic and intestinal stem cell compartments is particularly lethal and mitigators of this damage are critical in providing effective treatment. Parabiosis radiation experiments, in which the vasculatures of two rodents are anastomosed prior to irradiation of one of the animals, have shown that there is a circulating factor that protects mice from radiation-induced intestinal death. Recently reported studies have suggested that growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) is responsible for the rejuvenation of stem cells observed in parabiosis experiments involving aging mice. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of GDF11 as a potential mitigator of radiation-induced damage to intestinal stem cells. In ex vivo cultures of intestinal organoids, the number of cells expressing the stem cell marker Lgr5 was increased after irradiation and GDF11 supplementation. Further ex vivo studies to assess stem cell function, measured by the ability to grow new crypt-like structures, did not show increased stem cell activity in response to GDF11 treatment. In addition, GDF11 was unable to improve survival of mice subjected to total-abdominal irradiation. These data demonstrate that GDF11 does not mitigate radiation damage to intestinal stem cells.	
28498614        	Hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids is mediated by both sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and organic anion transporting polypeptides and modulated by intestinal sensing of plasma bile acid levels in mice.            	The Na+ -taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP/SLC10A1) is believed to be pivotal for hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids. However, plasma bile acid levels are normal in a subset of NTCP knockout mice and in mice treated with myrcludex B, a specific NTCP inhibitor. Here, we elucidated which transport proteins mediate the hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids and demonstrated intestinal sensing of elevated bile acid levels in plasma in mice. Mice or healthy volunteers were treated with myrcludex B. Hepatic bile acid uptake kinetics were determined in wild-type (WT), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) knockout mice (lacking Slco1a/1b isoforms), and human OATP1B1-transgenic mice. Effects of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) on hepatic transporter mRNA levels were assessed in rat hepatoma cells and in mice by peptide injection or adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression. NTCP inhibition using myrcludex B had only moderate effects on bile acid kinetics in WT mice, but completely inhibited active transport of conjugated bile acid species in OATP knockout mice. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase Cyp7a1 expression was strongly down-regulated upon prolonged inhibition of hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids. Fgf15 (mouse counterpart of FGF19) expression was induced in hypercholanemic OATP and NTCP knockout mice, as well as in myrcludex B-treated cholestatic mice, whereas plasma FGF19 was not induced in humans treated with myrcludex B. Fgf15/FGF19 expression was induced in polarized human enterocyte-models and mouse organoids by basolateral incubation with a high concentration (1 mM) of conjugated bile acids.                NTCP and OATPs contribute to hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids in mice, whereas the predominant uptake in humans is NTCP mediated. Enterocytes sense highly elevated levels of (conjugated) bile acids in the systemic circulation to induce FGF15/19, which modulates hepatic bile acid synthesis and uptake.

23250208        	Transmembrane/cytoplasmic, rather than catalytic, domains of Mmp14 signal to MAPK activation and mammary branching morphogenesis via binding to integrin β1.            	Epithelial cell invasion through the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a crucial step in branching morphogenesis. The mechanisms by which the mammary epithelium integrates cues from the ECM with intracellular signaling in order to coordinate invasion through the stroma to make the mammary tree are poorly understood. Because the cell membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase Mmp14 is known to play a key role in cancer cell invasion, we hypothesized that it could also be centrally involved in integrating signals for mammary epithelial cells (MECs) to navigate the collagen 1 (CL-1)-rich stroma of the mammary gland. Expression studies in nulliparous mice that carry a NLS-lacZ transgene downstream of the Mmp14 promoter revealed that Mmp14 is expressed in MECs at the tips of the branches. Using both mammary organoids and 3D organotypic cultures, we show that MMP activity is necessary for invasion through dense CL-1 (3 mg/ml) gels, but dispensable for MEC branching in sparse CL-1 (1 mg/ml) gels. Surprisingly, however, Mmp14 without its catalytic activity was still necessary for branching. Silencing Mmp14 prevented cell invasion through CL-1 and disrupted branching altogether; it also reduced integrin β1 (Itgb1) levels and attenuated MAPK signaling, disrupting Itgb1-dependent invasion/branching within CL-1 gels. FRET imaging revealed that Mmp14 associates directly with Itgb1. We identified a domain of Mmp14 that is required for modulating the levels of Itgb1, MEC signaling and the rate of invasion within CL-1. These results shed light on hitherto undescribed non-proteolytic activities of Mmp14 that are necessary for the Itgb1-dependent biochemical and mechanical signals that regulate branching in the mammary epithelium.	
33658498        	Somatic mutations and single-cell transcriptomes reveal the root of malignant rhabdoid tumours.            	Malignant rhabdoid tumour (MRT) is an often lethal childhood cancer that, like many paediatric tumours, is thought to arise from aberrant fetal development. The embryonic root and differentiation pathways underpinning MRT are not firmly established. Here, we study the origin of MRT by combining phylogenetic analyses and single-cell mRNA studies in patient-derived organoids. Comparison of somatic mutations shared between cancer and surrounding normal tissues places MRT in a lineage with neural crest-derived Schwann cells. Single-cell mRNA readouts of MRT differentiation, which we examine by reverting the genetic driver mutation underpinning MRT, SMARCB1 loss, suggest that cells are blocked en route to differentiating into mesenchyme. Quantitative transcriptional predictions indicate that combined HDAC and mTOR inhibition mimic MRT differentiation, which we confirm experimentally. Our study defines the developmental block of MRT and reveals potential differentiation therapies.	
28484457        	Type I and Type III Interferons Display Different Dependency on Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases to Mount an Antiviral State in the Human Gut.            	Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are constantly exposed to commensal flora and pathogen challenges. How IECs regulate their innate immune response to maintain gut homeostasis remains unclear. Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines produced during infections. While type I IFN receptors are ubiquitously expressed, type III IFN receptors are expressed only on epithelial cells. This epithelium specificity strongly suggests exclusive functions at epithelial surfaces, but the relative roles of type I and III IFNs in the establishment of an antiviral innate immune response in human IECs are not clearly defined. Here, we used mini-gut organoids to define the functions of types I and III IFNs to protect the human gut against viral infection. We show that primary non-transformed human IECs, upon viral challenge, upregulate the expression of both type I and type III IFNs at the transcriptional level but only secrete type III IFN in the supernatant. However, human IECs respond to both type I and type III IFNs by producing IFN-stimulated genes that in turn induce an antiviral state. Using genetic ablation of either type I or type III IFN receptors, we show that either IFN can independently restrict virus infection in human IECs. Importantly, we report, for the first time, differences in the mechanisms by which each IFN establishes the antiviral state. Contrary to type I IFN, the antiviral activity induced by type III IFN is strongly dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway, suggesting a pathway used by type III IFNs that non-redundantly contributes to the antiviral state. In conclusion, we demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells specifically regulate their innate immune response favoring type III IFN-mediated signaling, which allows for efficient protection against pathogens without producing excessive inflammation. Our results strongly suggest that type III IFN constitutes the frontline of antiviral response in the human gut. We propose that mucosal surfaces, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, have evolved to favor type III IFN-mediated response to pathogen infections as it allows for spatial segregation of signaling and moderate production of inflammatory signals which we propose are key to maintain gut homeostasis.	
28410991        	NAIP-NLRC4 Inflammasomes Coordinate Intestinal Epithelial Cell Expulsion with Eicosanoid and IL-18 Release via Activation of Caspase-1 and -8.            	Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) form a critical barrier against pathogen invasion. By generation of mice in which inflammasome expression is restricted to IECs, we describe a coordinated epithelium-intrinsic inflammasome response in vivo. This response was sufficient to protect against Salmonella tissue invasion and involved a previously reported IEC expulsion that was coordinated with lipid mediator and cytokine production and lytic IEC death. Excessive inflammasome activation in IECs was sufficient to result in diarrhea and pathology. Experiments with IEC organoids demonstrated that IEC expulsion did not require other cell types. IEC expulsion was accompanied by a major actin rearrangement in neighboring cells that maintained epithelium integrity but did not absolutely require Caspase-1 or Gasdermin D. Analysis of Casp1-/-Casp8-/- mice revealed a functional Caspase-8 inflammasome in vivo. Thus, a coordinated IEC-intrinsic, Caspase-1 and -8 inflammasome response plays a key role in intestinal immune defense and pathology.                Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

27186430        	ALDH2 modulates autophagy flux to regulate acetaldehyde-mediated toxicity thresholds.            	A polymorphic mutation in the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene has been epidemiologically linked to the high susceptibility to esophageal carcinogenesis for individuals with alcohol use disorders. Mice subjected to alcohol drinking show increased oxidative stress and DNA adduct formation in esophageal epithelia where Aldh2 loss augments alcohol-induced genotoxic effects; however, it remains elusive as to how esophageal epithelial cells with dysfunctional Aldh2 cope with oxidative stress related to alcohol metabolism. Here, we investigated the role of autophagy in murine esophageal epithelial cells (keratinocytes) exposed to ethanol and acetaldehyde. We find that ethanol and acetaldehyde trigger oxidative stress via mitochondrial superoxide in esophageal keratinocytes. Aldh2-deficient cells appeared to be highly susceptible to ethanol- or acetaldehyde-mediated toxicity. Alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated acetaldehyde production was implicated in ethanol-induced cell injury in Aldh2 deficient cells as ethanol-induced oxidative stress and cell death was partially inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole. Acetaldehyde activated autophagy flux in esophageal keratinocytes where Aldh2 deficiency increased dependence on autophagy to cope with ethanol-induced acetaldehyde-mediated oxidative stress. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy flux by chloroquine stabilized p62/SQSTM1, and increased basal and acetaldehyde-mediate oxidative stress in Aldh2 deficient cells as documented in monolayer culture as well as single-cell derived three-dimensional esophageal organoids, recapitulating a physiological esophageal epithelial proliferation-differentiation gradient. Our innovative approach indicates, for the first time, that autophagy may provide cytoprotection to esophageal epithelial cells responding to oxidative stress that is induced by ethanol and its major metabolite acetaldehyde. Defining autophagymediated cytoprotection against alcohol-induced genotoxicity in the context of Aldh2 deficiency, our study provides mechanistic insights into the tumor suppressor functions of ALDH2 and autophagy in alcohol-related esophageal carcinogenesis.	
19898974        	Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.            	Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, originally described in the lung. The tumor rarely occurs in extrapulmonary sites like the gastrointestinal tract, and only few examples have been described in the ampulla of Vater. A new case of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater in a 60-year-old man is reported. After pancreatoduodenectomy, macroscopic examination revealed ulcerated tumor in the region of the ampulla of Vater. Microscopically, the tumor exhibited organoid, predominantly nested growth pattern, consisting of large, polygonal cells with pleomorphic nuclei. Average number of mitoses was 36 per 10 high-power fields. Small and large areas of necrosis were identified. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, PGP 9.5, neuron-specific enolase, pancytokeratin, CK8 and somatostatin and negative for CK7, CK20, S-100, TTF-1, HMB-45, CD117, E-cadherin and regulatory peptides. Ki-67 proliferative index was 41%. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) analysis showed almost identical results for HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3--60, 60.3 and 61%, respectively. Two months after surgery, liver metastases occurred, confirming highly aggressive behavior of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.	
22910029        	A potential role of progestin-induced laminin-5/α6-integrin signaling in the formation of side branches in the mammary gland.            	Mammary organoids from adult mice produce tubules, analogous to mammary ducts in vivo, in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) when cultured in collagen gels. The combination of HGF plus progestin (R5020) causes reduced tubule number and length. We hypothesized that the inhibitory effect on tubulogenesis was due to progestin-mediated alteration of HGF/c-Met signaling. Using molecular inhibitors and short hairpin RNA, it was determined that HGF activation of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac1) was required for the formation of cytoplasmic extensions, the first step of tubulogenesis, and that Rac1 activity was Src kinase (Src) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) dependent. The highly novel finding was that R5020 reduced tubulogenesis by up-regulating and increasing extracellular laminin and α6-integrin ligation to reduce activation of the Src, focal adhesion kinase, and Rac1 pathway. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, another progesterone-induced paracrine factor, did not replicate this effect of R5020. The inhibitory effect of R5020 on tubulogenesis was likely mediated through progesterone receptor (PR) isoform A (PRA), because PRA is the predominant PR isoform expressed in the organoids, and the progestin-induced effect was prevented by the PR antagonist RU486. These results provide a plausible mechanism that explains progestin/PRA-mediated blunting of HGF-induced tubulogenesis in vitro and is proposed to be relevant to progesterone/PRA-induced side-branching in vivo during pregnancy.	
24906150        	Hippo pathway activity influences liver cell fate.            	The Hippo-signaling pathway is an important regulator of cellular proliferation and organ size. However, little is known about the role of this cascade in the control of cell fate. Employing a combination of lineage tracing, clonal analysis, and organoid culture approaches, we demonstrate that Hippo pathway activity is essential for the maintenance of the differentiated hepatocyte state. Remarkably, acute inactivation of Hippo pathway signaling in vivo is sufficient to dedifferentiate, at very high efficiencies, adult hepatocytes into cells bearing progenitor characteristics. These hepatocyte-derived progenitor cells demonstrate self-renewal and engraftment capacity at the single-cell level. We also identify the NOTCH-signaling pathway as a functional important effector downstream of the Hippo transducer YAP. Our findings uncover a potent role for Hippo/YAP signaling in controlling liver cell fate and reveal an unprecedented level of phenotypic plasticity in mature hepatocytes, which has implications for the understanding and manipulation of liver regeneration.

33462395        	Opposing Wnt signals regulate cervical squamocolumnar homeostasis and emergence of metaplasia.            	The transition zones of the squamous and columnar epithelia constitute hotspots for the emergence of cancer, often preceded by metaplasia, in which one epithelial type is replaced by another. It remains unclear how the epithelial spatial organization is maintained and how the transition zone niche is remodelled during metaplasia. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize epithelial subpopulations and the underlying stromal compartment of endo- and ectocervix, encompassing the transition zone. Mouse lineage tracing, organoid culture and single-molecule RNA in situ hybridizations revealed that the two epithelia derive from separate cervix-resident lineage-specific stem cell populations regulated by opposing Wnt signals from the stroma. Using a mouse model of cervical metaplasia, we further show that the endocervical stroma undergoes remodelling and increases expression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-2 (DKK2), promoting the outgrowth of ectocervical stem cells. Our data indicate that homeostasis at the transition zone results from divergent stromal signals, driving the differential proliferation of resident epithelial lineages.	
23752315        	Grape exosome-like nanoparticles induce intestinal stem cells and protect mice from DSS-induced colitis.            	Food-derived exosome-like nanoparticles pass through the intestinal tract throughout our lives, but little is known about their impact or function. Here, as a proof of concept, we show that the cells targeted by grape exosome-like nanoparticles (GELNs) are intestinal stem cells whose responses underlie the GELN-mediated intestinal tissue remodeling and protection against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. This finding is further supported by the fact that coculturing of crypt or sorted Lgr5⁺ stem cells with GELNs markedly improved organoid formation. GELN lipids play a role in induction of Lgr5⁺ stem cells, and the liposome-like nanoparticles (LLNs) assembled with lipids from GELNs are required for in vivo targeting of intestinal stem cells. Blocking β-catenin-mediated signaling pathways of GELN recipient cells attenuates the production of Lgr5⁺ stem cells. Thus, GELNs not only modulate intestinal tissue renewal processes, but can participate in the remodeling of it in response to pathological triggers.	
29333475        	Whole-mount Enteroid Proliferation Staining.            	Small intestinal organoids, otherwise known as enteroids, have become an increasingly utilized model for intestinal biology in vitro as they recapitulate the various epithelial cells within the intestinal crypt (Mahe et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2009). Assessment of growth dynamics within these cultures is an important step to understanding how alterations in gene expression, treatment with protective and toxic agents, and genetic mutations alter properties essential for crypt growth and survival as well as the stem cell properties of the individual cells within the crypt. This protocol describes a method of visualization of proliferating cells within the crypt in three dimensions (Barrett et al., 2015). Whole-mount proliferation staining of enteroids using EdU incorporation enables the researcher to view all proliferating cells within the enteroid as opposed to obtaining growth information in thin slices as would be seen with embedding and sectioning, ensuring a true representation of proliferation from the stem cell compartment to the terminally differentiated cells of the crypt.	
33430424        	Experimental Models to Study COVID-19 Effect in Stem Cells.            	The new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) emerged in 2019 and hence is often referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This disease causes hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is considered as the cause of a global pandemic. Very limited reports in addition to ex vivo model systems are available to understand the mechanism of action of this virus, which can be used for testing of any drug efficacy against virus infectivity. COVID-19 induces tissue stem cell loss, resulting inhibition of epithelial repair followed by inflammatory fibrotic consequences. Development of clinically relevant models is important to examine the impact of the COVID-19 virus in tissue stem cells among different organs. In this review, we discuss ex vivo experimental models available to study the effect of COVID-19 on tissue stem cells.

26392003        	Isolation and Characterization of Human Adult Epithelial Stem Cells from the Periodontal Ligament.            	We report a novel method for the isolation of adult human epithelial stem cells (hEpiSCs) from the epithelial component of the periodontal ligament-the human epithelial cell rests of Malassez (hERM). hEpiSC-rich integrin-α6(+ve) hERM cells derived by fluorometry can be clonally expanded, can grow organoids, and express the markers of pluripotency (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2), polycomb protein RING1B, and the hEpiSC supermarker LGR5. They maintain the growth profile of their originating hERM in vitro. Subcutaneous cotransplantation with mesenchymal stem cells from the dental pulp on poly-l-lactic acid scaffolds in nude mice gave rise to perfect heterotopic ossicles in vivo with ultrastructure of dentin, enamel, cementum, and bone. These remarkable fully mineralized ossicles underscore the importance of epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk in tissue regeneration using human progenitor stem cells, which may have already committed to lineage despite maintaining hallmarks of pluripotency. In addition, we report the clonal expansion and isolation of human LGR5(+ve) cells from the hERM in xeno-free culture conditions. The genetic profile of LGR5(+ve) cells includes both markers of pluripotency and genes important for secretory epithelial and dental epithelial cell differentiation, giving us a first insight into periodontal ligament-derived hEpiSCs.                 © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2015.	
21163163        	Epidermal nevus.            	A healthy 25-year-old man presented with a widespread, non-organoid, non-epidermolytic epidermal nevus. In addition to extensive hyperpigented patches and thin plaques following Blaschko lines, there were superimposed psoriasiform plaques on the elbows and warty plaques on the upper trunk. Striate palmar keraoderma also was evident. We review the clinical morphologies, sites of involvement, histopathologic findings (presence or absence of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis), and syndromal associations of non-organoid EN with underlying mutations in different genes.	
20070149        	Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors: an ultrastructural analysis of 13 cases.            	Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors (UTROSCT) are tumors of unclear histogenesis. The authors analyzed the ultrastructural features of 13 UTROSCT and correlated the findings with their immunohistochemical profile. Features included cells with frequent organoid, nested or cord-like arrangement (8), lumen formation (2; one of which showed surface microvilli), nuclei with irregular indentations (8), intermediate filaments (13), prominent paranuclear aggregates (5), cell junctions (9), desmosome-like junctions (2), tonofilaments (2), basal lamina (1), and cytoplasmic lipid droplets (7; prominent in 3). No dense bodies, subplasmalemmal densities or pinocytotic vesicles were seen. Ultrastructural epithelial differentiation was present in 2 tumors (positive for keratin or epithelial membrane antigen). Prominent lipid droplets correlated with sex cord markers positivity in 2 tumors. Ultrastructural features of smooth muscle differentiation were lacking and abundant paranuclear filaments did not correlate with myoid markers. UTROSCT are polyphenotypic neoplasms ultrastructurally with focal epithelial and variable sex cord-like differentiation. These findings suggest that UTROSCT may result from divergent differentiation in endometrial stromal tumors or represent a distinct group of uterine tumors with sex cord-like differentiation that are closer in histogenesis to ovarian sex cord stromal tumors.	
26187040        	Loss of PHLPP protects against colitis by inhibiting intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis.            	A common feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the loss of intestinal epithelial barrier function due to excessive apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, the molecular mechanism underlying increased IEC apoptosis remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of PHLPP, a novel family of protein phosphatases, in regulating inflammation-induced IEC apoptosis in mouse models of colitis. Both Phlpp1 and Phlpp2 genes were deleted in mice. Compared with wild-type mice, PHLPP double knockout (DKO) mice were protected from colitis induced by DSS as demonstrated by lower histopathological scores, and this reduced susceptibility to colitis was associated with decreased apoptosis and increased Akt activity in IECs in vivo. In addition, epithelial organoids derived from PHLPP DKO mice were more resistant to inflammation-induced apoptosis while inhibition of Akt activity abolished the protective effect of PHLPP-loss. Furthermore, we found that PHLPP expression was significantly reduced in IECs following the induction of colitis by DSS and in human IBD patient samples. This inflammation-induced downregulation of PHLPP was partially blocked by treating cells with a proteasome inhibitor. Taken together, our results indicated that proteasome-mediated degradation of PHLPP at the onset of inflammation plays an important role in protecting IEC injury by inhibiting apoptosis.

22917215        	Optochemogenetics (OCG) allows more precise control of genetic engineering in mice with CreER regulators.            	New approaches that allow precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression in model organisms at the single cell level are necessary to better dissect the role of specific genes and cell populations in development, disease, and therapy. Here, we describe a new optochemogenetic switch (OCG switch) to control CreER/loxP-mediated recombination via photoactivatable ("caged") tamoxifen analogues in individual cells in cell culture, organoid culture, and in vivo in adult mice. This approach opens opportunities to more fully exploit existing CreER transgenic mouse strains to achieve more precise temporal- and location-specific regulation of genetic events and gene expression.	
33484640        	Transit-Amplifying Cells Coordinate Changes in Intestinal Epithelial Cell-Type Composition.            	Renewing tissues have the remarkable ability to continually produce both proliferative progenitor and specialized differentiated cell types. How are complex milieus of microenvironmental signals interpreted to coordinate tissue-cell-type composition? Here, we investigate the responses of intestinal epithelium to individual and paired perturbations across eight epithelial signaling pathways. Using a high-throughput approach that combines enteroid monolayers and quantitative imaging, we identified conditions that enrich for specific cell types as well as interactions between pathways. Importantly, we found that modulation of transit-amplifying cell proliferation changes the ratio of differentiated secretory to absorptive cell types. These observations highlight an underappreciated role for transit-amplifying cells in the tuning of differentiated cell-type composition.                Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

33394264        	A contemporary update on glioblastoma: molecular biology, current management, and a vision towards bio-adaptable personalized care.            	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most fatal brain tumor in adults. Current survival rates of GBM remain below 2 years due to GBM's aggressive cellular migration and genetically driven treatment escape pathways. Despite our rapidly increasing understanding of GBM biology, earlier diagnoses, and refined surgical techniques, only moderate survival benefits have been achieved. Nonetheless, the pressing need for better survival rates has brought forward a multitude of newer therapeutic approaches and opened the door for potential personalization of these modalities in the near future.                We reviewed the published literature discussing the current state of knowledge regarding GBM biology and therapy and summarized the information that may point toward future personalized therapeutic strategies.                Several novel modalities such as oncolytic viruses, targeted immune, and molecular therapies, and tumor treating fields have been introduced. To date, there is no single treatment modality for GBM, but rather a wide spectrum of combined modalities that address intratumoral cellular and genetic variabilities. While the current state of GBM research and clinical trial landscape may hold promise, current literature lacks any fruitful progress towards personalized GBM therapy.                In this review, we are discussing our recent knowledge of the GBM genetic biologic landscape and the current advances in therapy, as well as providing a blueprint for an envisioned GBM management paradigm that should be personalized and adaptable to accommodate each patient's diverse genetic variations and therapy response/escape patterns.	
33498747        	JAK-STAT Pathway Inhibition Partially Restores Intestinal Homeostasis in Hdac1- and Hdac2-Intestinal Epithelial Cell-Deficient Mice.            	We have previously reported that histone deacetylase epigenetic regulator Hdac1 and Hdac2 deletion in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) disrupts mucosal tissue architecture and barrier, causing chronic inflammation. In this study, proteome and transcriptome analysis revealed the importance of signaling pathways induced upon genetic IEC-Hdac1 and Hdac2 deletion. Indeed, Gene Ontology biological process analysis of enriched deficient IEC RNA and proteins identified common pathways, including lipid metabolic and oxidation-reduction process, cell adhesion, and antigen processing and presentation, related to immune responses, correlating with dysregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Top upstream regulators included regulators associated with environmental sensing pathways to xenobiotics, microbial and diet-derived ligands, and endogenous metabolites. Proteome analysis revealed mTOR signaling IEC-specific defects. In addition to mTOR, the STAT and Notch pathways were dysregulated specifically in jejunal IEC. To determine the impact of pathway dysregulation on mutant jejunum alterations, we treated mutant mice with Tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor. Treatment with the inhibitor partially corrected proliferation and tight junction defects, as well as niche stabilization by increasing Paneth cell numbers. Thus, IEC-specific histone deacetylases 1 (HDAC1) and 2 (HDAC2) support intestinal homeostasis by regulating survival and translation processes, as well as differentiation and metabolic pathways. HDAC1 and HDAC2 may play an important role in the regulation of IEC-specific inflammatory responses by controlling, directly or indirectly, the JAK/STAT pathway. IEC-specific JAK/STAT pathway deregulation may be, at least in part, responsible for intestinal homeostasis disruption in mutant mice.	
25079453        	In vitro pancreas organogenesis from dispersed mouse embryonic progenitors.            	The pancreas is an essential organ that regulates glucose homeostasis and secretes digestive enzymes. Research on pancreas embryogenesis has led to the development of protocols to produce pancreatic cells from stem cells (1). The whole embryonic organ can be cultured at multiple stages of development (2-4). These culture methods have been useful to test drugs and to image developmental processes. However the expansion of the organ is very limited and morphogenesis is not faithfully recapitulated since the organ flattens. We propose three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions that enable the efficient expansion of dissociated mouse embryonic pancreatic progenitors. By manipulating the composition of the culture medium it is possible to generate either hollow spheres, mainly composed of pancreatic progenitors expanding in their initial state, or, complex organoids which progress to more mature expanding progenitors and differentiate into endocrine, acinar and ductal cells and which spontaneously self-organize to resemble the embryonic pancreas. We show here that the in vitro process recapitulates many aspects of natural pancreas development. This culture system is suitable to investigate how cells cooperate to form an organ by reducing its initial complexity to few progenitors. It is a model that reproduces the 3D architecture of the pancreas and that is therefore useful to study morphogenesis, including polarization of epithelial structures and branching. It is also appropriate to assess the response to mechanical cues of the niche such as stiffness and the effects on cell´s tensegrity.	
24980747        	Paneth cell extrusion and release of antimicrobial products is directly controlled by immune cell-derived IFN-γ.            	Paneth cells (PCs) are terminally differentiated, highly specialized secretory cells located at the base of the crypts of Lieberkühn in the small intestine. Besides their antimicrobial function, PCs serve as a component of the intestinal stem cell niche. By secreting granules containing bactericidal proteins like defensins/cryptdins and lysozyme, PCs regulate the microbiome of the gut. Here we study the control of PC degranulation in primary epithelial organoids in culture. We show that PC degranulation does not directly occur upon stimulation with microbial antigens or bacteria. In contrast, the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) induces rapid and complete loss of granules. Using live cell imaging, we show that degranulation is coupled to luminal extrusion and death of PCs. Transfer of supernatants from in vitro stimulated iNKT cells recapitulates degranulation in an IFN-γ-dependent manner. Furthermore, endogenous IFN-γ secretion induced by anti-CD3 antibody injection causes Paneth loss and release of goblet cell mucus. The identification of IFN-γ as a trigger for degranulation and extrusion of PCs establishes a novel effector mechanism by which immune responses may regulate epithelial status and the gut microbiome.                 © 2014 Farin et al.	
24693965        	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is a key mediator of hormone-induced leukocyte infiltration in the pubertal female mammary gland.            	It is well documented that macrophages and eosinophils play important roles in normal murine pubertal mammary gland development. Although it is accepted that estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) are key players in mammary gland development, the roles these hormones might play in regulating the actions of leukocytes in that process is an understudied area. We show here that P and E, respectively, induce unique, but overlapping, sets of proinflammatory and angiogenic cytokines and chemokines, in the pubertal female BALB/c mammary gland, as well as induce infiltration of macrophages and eosinophils to the mammary periepithelium. This extends earlier studies showing P induction of proinflammatory products in pubertal and adult mammary epithelial organoids and P-induced in vivo infiltration of leukocytes to the adult mammary periepithelium. Importantly, epidermal growth factor receptor-signaling, which is likely mediated by amphiregulin (Areg), a downstream mediator of E and P, is both necessary and sufficient for both E- and P-induced recruitment of macrophages and eosinophils to the pubertal mammary periepithelium. We further show that receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), although not sufficient of itself to cause macrophage and eosinophil recruitment, contributes to an optimal response to P. The potency of Areg is highlighted by the fact that it is sufficient to induce macrophage and eosinophil recruitment at levels equivalent to that induced by either E or P. Our finding of a dominant role for Areg in hormonally induced leukocyte recruitment to the pubertal mammary gland parallels its dominance in regulating ductal outgrowth and its role in P-induced proliferation in the pubertal gland.	
20542174        	The group of epidermal nevus syndromes Part I. Well defined phenotypes.            	The epidermal nevus syndromes represent a group of distinct disorders that can be distinguished by the type of associated epidermal nevus and by the criterion of presence or absence of heritability. Well defined syndromes characterized by organoid epidermal nevi include Schimmelpenning syndrome, phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica, nevus comedonicus syndrome, angora hair nevus syndrome, and Becker nevus syndrome. The molecular basis of these disorders has so far not been identified. By contrast, the group of syndromes characterized by keratinocytic nevi comprises three phenotypes with a known molecular etiology in the form of CHILD (congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects) syndrome, type 2 segmental Cowden disease, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 epidermal nevus syndrome (García-Hafner-Happle syndrome), whereas Proteus syndrome is still of unknown origin. From this overview, it is clear that a specific type of these disorders cannot be classified by the name "epidermal nevus syndrome" nor by the terms "organoid nevus syndrome" or "keratinocytic nevus syndrome."                After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish nine different epidermal nevus syndromes by their characteristic features, understand the practical significance of avoiding terms like "epidermal nevus syndrome" or "keratinocytic nevus syndrome" to define any specific entity within this group of disorders, and differentiate between nonhereditary traits and those bearing a genetic risk because of either Mendelian or non-Mendelian inheritance.

24613355        	De novo formation of insulin-producing "neo-β cell islets" from intestinal crypts.            	The ability to interconvert terminally differentiated cells could serve as a powerful tool for cell-based treatment of degenerative diseases, including diabetes mellitus. To determine which, if any, adult tissues are competent to activate an islet β cell program, we performed an in vivo screen by expressing three β cell "reprogramming factors" in a wide spectrum of tissues. We report that transient intestinal expression of these factors-Pdx1, MafA, and Ngn3 (PMN)-promotes rapid conversion of intestinal crypt cells into endocrine cells, which coalesce into "neoislets" below the crypt base. Neoislet cells express insulin and show ultrastructural features of β cells. Importantly, intestinal neoislets are glucose-responsive and able to ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Moreover, PMN expression in human intestinal "organoids" stimulates the conversion of intestinal epithelial cells into β-like cells. Our results thus demonstrate that the intestine is an accessible and abundant source of functional insulin-producing cells.                 Copyright © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

24550486        	Shp2/MAPK signaling controls goblet/paneth cell fate decisions in the intestine.            	In the development of the mammalian intestine, Notch and Wnt/β-catenin signals control stem cell maintenance and their differentiation into absorptive and secretory cells. Mechanisms that regulate differentiation of progenitors into the three secretory lineages, goblet, paneth, or enteroendocrine cells, are not fully understood. Using conditional mutagenesis in mice, we observed that Shp2-mediated MAPK signaling determines the choice between paneth and goblet cell fates and also affects stem cells, which express the leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor 5 (Lgr5). Ablation of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 in the intestinal epithelium reduced MAPK signaling and led to a reduction of goblet cells while promoting paneth cell development. Conversely, conditional mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (Mek1) activation rescued the Shp2 phenotype, promoted goblet cell and inhibited paneth cell generation. The Shp2 mutation also expanded Lgr5+ stem cell niches, which could be restricted by activated Mek1 signaling. Changes of Lgr5+ stem cell quantities were accompanied by alterations of paneth cells, indicating that Shp2/MAPK signaling might affect stem cell niches directly or via paneth cells. Remarkably, inhibition of MAPK signaling in intestinal organoids and cultured cells changed the relative abundance of Tcf4 isoforms and by this, promoted Wnt/β-catenin activity. The data thus show that Shp2-mediated MAPK signaling controls the choice between goblet and paneth cell fates by regulating Wnt/β-catenin activity.

24130330        	Artificial three-dimensional niches deconstruct pancreas development in vitro.            	In the context of a cellular therapy for diabetes, methods for pancreatic progenitor expansion and subsequent differentiation into insulin-producing beta cells would be extremely valuable. Here we establish three-dimensional culture conditions in Matrigel that enable the efficient expansion of dissociated mouse embryonic pancreatic progenitors. By manipulating the medium composition we generate either hollow spheres, which are mainly composed of pancreatic progenitors, or complex organoids that spontaneously undergo pancreatic morphogenesis and differentiation. The in vitro maintenance and expansion of pancreatic progenitors require active Notch and FGF signaling, thus recapitulating in vivo niche signaling interactions. Our experiments reveal new aspects of pancreas development, such as a community effect by which small groups of cells better maintain progenitor properties and expand more efficiently than isolated cells, as well as the requirement for three-dimensionality. Finally, growth conditions in chemically defined biomaterials pave the way for testing the biophysical and biochemical properties of the niche that sustains pancreatic progenitors.	
33479301        	Ex vivo culture of intact human patient derived pancreatic tumour tissue.            	The poor prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is attributed to the highly fibrotic stroma and complex multi-cellular microenvironment that is difficult to fully recapitulate in pre-clinical models. To fast-track translation of therapies and to inform personalised medicine, we aimed to develop a whole-tissue ex vivo explant model that maintains viability, 3D multicellular architecture, and microenvironmental cues of human pancreatic tumours. Patient-derived surgically-resected PDAC tissue was cut into 1-2 mm explants and cultured on gelatin sponges for 12 days. Immunohistochemistry revealed that human PDAC explants were viable for 12 days and maintained their original tumour, stromal and extracellular matrix architecture. As proof-of-principle, human PDAC explants were treated with Abraxane and we observed different levels of response between patients. PDAC explants were also transfected with polymeric nanoparticles + Cy5-siRNA and we observed abundant cytoplasmic distribution of Cy5-siRNA throughout the PDAC explants. Overall, our novel model retains the 3D architecture of human PDAC and has advantages over standard organoids: presence of functional multi-cellular stroma and fibrosis, and no tissue manipulation, digestion, or artificial propagation of organoids. This provides unprecedented opportunity to study PDAC biology including tumour-stromal interactions and rapidly assess therapeutic response to drive personalised treatment.	
33634305        	Controlled orientation and sustained rotation of biological samples in a sono-optical microfluidic device.            	In cell biology, recently developed technologies for studying suspended cell clusters, such as organoids or cancer spheroids, hold great promise relative to traditional 2D cell cultures. There is, however, growing awareness that sample confinement, such as fixation on a surface or embedding in a gel, has substantial impact on cell clusters. This creates a need for contact-less tools for 3D manipulation and inspection. This work addresses this demand by presenting a reconfigurable, hybrid sono-optical system for contact-free 3D manipulation and imaging, which is suitable for biological samples up to a few hundreds of micrometers in liquid suspension. In our sono-optical device, three independently addressable MHz transducers, an optically transparent top-transducer for levitation and two side-transducers, provide ultrasound excitation from three orthogonal directions. Steerable holographic optical tweezers give us an additional means of manipulation of the acoustically trapped specimen with high spatial resolution. We demonstrate how to control the reorientation or the spinning of complex samples, for instance for 3D visual inspection or for volumetric reconstruction. Whether continuous rotation or transient reorientation takes place depends on the strength of the acoustic radiation torque, arising from pressure gradients, compared to the acoustic viscous torque, arising from the shear forces at the viscous boundary layer around the particle. Based on numerical simulations and experimental insights, we develop a strategy to achieve a desired alignment or continuous rotation around a chosen axis, by tuning the relative strengths of the transducers and thus adjusting the relative contributions of viscous and radiation torques. The approach is widely applicable, as we discuss in several generic examples, with limitations dictated by size and shape asymmetry of the samples.	
33479497        	Epithelium-derived Indian Hedgehog restricts stromal expression of ErbB family members that drive colonic tumor cell proliferation.            	Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) is a morphogen expressed by epithelial cells in the small intestine and colon that signals in a paracrine manner to gp38+ stromal cells. The loss of Ihh signaling results in increased epithelial proliferation, lengthening and multiplication of intestinal crypts and the activation of a stromal cell immune response. How Ihh controls epithelial proliferation through the stroma and how it affects colorectal cancer development remains poorly defined. To study the influence of Ihh signaling on the earliest stage of colorectal carcinogenesis, we used a well characterized mouse model in which both alleles of the Adenoma Polyposis Coli (Apc) gene could be inducibly deleted, leading to instant transformation of the colonic epithelium to an adenomatous phenotype. Concurrent deletion of Ihh from the adenomatous colonic epithelium of Apc inducible double mutant mice resulted in a remarkable increase in the hyperproliferative epithelial phenotype and increased accumulation of Lgr5+ stem cells. Transcriptional profiling of sorted colonic gp38+ fibroblasts showed upregulation of three ErbB pathway ligands (EREG, BTC, and NRG1) in Apc-/-Ihh-/- double mutant mice. We found that recombinant EREG, BTC, and NRG1 but not Lgr5 ligand R-Spondin promoted growth and proliferation of Apc double mutant colonic organoids. Thus, the loss of Ihh enhances Apc-driven colonic adenomagenesis via upregulation of ErbB pathway family members in colonic stromal cells. Our findings highlight the critical role of epithelium-derived Indian Hedgehog as a stromal tumor suppressor in the intestine.	
33278488        	Engineering human hematopoietic environments through ossicle and bioreactor technologies exploitation.            	The bone marrow microenvironment contains cellular niches that maintain the pool of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and support hematopoietic maturation. Malignant hematopoietic cells also co-opt normal cellular interactions to promote their own growth and evade therapy. In vivo systems used to study human hematopoiesis have been developed through transplantation into immunodeficient mouse models. However, incomplete cross-compatibility between the murine stroma and transplanted human hematopoietic cells limits the rate of engraftment and the study of relevant interactions. To supplement in vivo xenotransplantation models, complementary strategies have recently been developed, including the use of three-dimensional human bone marrow organoids in vivo, generated from bone marrow stromal cells seeded onto osteo-inductive scaffolds, as well as the use of ex vivo bioreactor models. These topics were the focus of the Spring 2020 International Society for Experimental Hematology New Investigator webinar. We review here the latest advances in generating humanized hematopoietic organoids and how they allow for the study of novel microenvironmental interactions.

32361827        	Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Neural Progenitor Cells--a Preclinical Evaluation for Stroke Treatment in Mice.            	Stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enhance neurological recovery in preclinical stroke models by secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs). Since previous reports have focused on the application of MSC-EVs only, the role of the most suitable host cell for EV enrichment and preclinical stroke treatment remains elusive. The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of EVs derived from neural progenitor cells (NPCs) following experimental stroke. Using the PEG technique, EVs were enriched and characterized by electron microscopy, proteomics, rt-PCR, nanosight tracking analysis, and Western blotting. Different dosages of NPC-EVs displaying a characteristic profile in size, shape, cargo protein, and non-coding RNA contents were incubated in the presence of cerebral organoids exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), significantly reducing cell injury when compared with control organoids. Systemic administration of NPC-EVs in male C57BL6 mice following experimental ischemia enhanced neurological recovery and neuroregeneration for as long as 3 months. Interestingly, the therapeutic impact of such NPC-EVs was found to be not inferior to MSC-EVs. Flow cytometric analyses of blood and brain samples 7 days post-stroke demonstrated increased blood concentrations of B and T lymphocytes after NPC-EV delivery, without affecting cerebral cell counts. Likewise, a biodistribution analysis after systemic delivery of NPC-EVs revealed the majority of NPC-EVs to be found in extracranial organs such as the liver and the lung. This proof-of-concept study supports the idea of EVs being a general concept of stem cell-induced neuroprotection under stroke conditions, where EVs contribute to reverting the peripheral post-stroke immunosuppression.	
29769669        	Diverse mechanisms for endogenous regeneration and repair in mammalian organs.            	Mammalian organs comprise an extraordinary diversity of cell and tissue types. Regenerative organs, such as the skin and gastrointestinal tract, use resident stem cells to maintain tissue function. Organs with a lower cellular turnover, such as the liver and lungs, mostly rely on proliferation of committed progenitor cells. In many organs, injury reveals the plasticity of both resident stem cells and differentiated cells. The ability of resident cells to maintain and repair organs diminishes with age, whereas, paradoxically, the risk of cancer increases. New therapeutic approaches aim to harness cell plasticity for tissue repair and regeneration while avoiding the risk of malignant transformation of cells.	
20526546        	Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica with nephroblastoma and juvenile hypertension.            	Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica is characterized by the coexistence of an organoid epidermal naevus, follow-ing Blaschko's lines, and a large speckled lentiginous naevus, typically arranged in a chequerboard pattern. This entity has been isolated from the group of epidermal naevus syndromes and is frequently associated with extracutaneous anomalies. We report here the first observation of phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica associated with nephroblastoma. In addition to this paediatric renal tumour, the coexistence of juvenile arterial hypertension suggests an associated vascular defect. The link between the extracutaneous manifestations and cutaneous twin spot phenotype is discussed.	
20168062        	[A case of undifferentiated (embryonal) liver sarcoma mimicking klatskin tumor in an adult].            	Undifferentiated sarcoma is an uncommon primary malignant tumor of the liver typically occurring in older children. It is also referred to as malignant mesenchymoma, fibromyxosarcoma, or mesenchymal sarcoma. We experienced a case of undifferentiated sarcoma in 72-year-old male. Contrast enhanced liver CT scan revealed a 3.4 cm heterogeneously enhancing, ill-defined, and low attenuated mass in the left liver and subtle intrahepatic duct dilatation. And, in tubogram, there were segmental stenosis and occlusion from the hilum to the proximal common bile duct. We did ultrasonography guided liver biopsy. The pathologic finding revealed infiltrative growth of atypical cells with rhabdoid features. Some atypical cells showed clear cytoplasm, but no organoid pattern was identified. The stroma around atypical cells was filled with eosinophilic hyaline material. These tumor cells were positive for vimentin only, and the tumor was consistent with undifferentiated sarcoma of the liver.	
20826792        	miR-21 and miR-31 converge on TIAM1 to regulate migration and invasion of colon carcinoma cells.            	TGF-β promotes cell migration and invasion, an attribute that is linked to the pro-metastasis function of this cytokine in late stage cancers. The LIM 1863 colon carcinoma organoid undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to TGF-β. This process is markedly accelerated by TNF-α, and we found that the levels of miR-21 and miR-31 were prominently elevated under the synergistic actions of TGF-β/TNF-α. Consistent with this, overexpression of either miR-21 or miR-31 significantly enhanced the effect of TGF-β alone on LIM 1863 morphological changes. More importantly, transwell assays demonstrated the positive effects of both miR-21 and miR-31 in TGF-β regulation of LIM 1863 motility and invasiveness. Elevated levels of miR-21 and miR-31 also enhanced motility and invasiveness of other colon carcinoma cell lines. We present compelling evidence that TIAM1, a guanidine exchange factor of the Rac GTPase, is a direct target of both miR-21 and miR-31. Indeed in LIM 1863 cells, suppression of TIAM1 is required for miR-21/miR-31 to enhance cell migration and invasion. Therefore, we have uncovered miR-21 and miR-31 as downstream effectors of TGF-β in facilitating invasion and metastasis of colon carcinoma cells.	
20595888        	Atypical carcinoid metastasis to the skin.            	Carcinoid tumors are derived from neuroendocrine cells, and are most frequently found in the gastrointestinal tract and bronchopulmonary system. Cutaneous involvement of carcinoid tumors is relatively rare, with isolated case reports in the literature. We detail a patient with stage IV pulmonary atypical carcinoid tumor with skin metastasis. This case is unusual because the patient did not have any erythema or induration of the scalp, only a complaint of pain. On biopsy, the tumor cells had cytologic features of a carcinoid tumor, but were arranged as infiltrating cords, small aggregates and single units, rather than the organoid or trabecular pattern seen in the primary tumor. Further, along with neuroendocrine markers, the tumor cells had the staining pattern of cytokeratin 7+/cytokeratin 20-/thyroid transcription factor-1+, supporting a carcinoid tumor of lung origin. Thus, this case of skin metastasis from an atypical pulmonary carcinoid tumor illustrates a unique clinical and histologic presentation.	
31885878        	The β-catenin/YAP signaling axis is a key regulator of melanoma-associated fibroblasts.            	β-catenin is a multifunctional protein that plays crucial roles in embryonic development, physiological homeostasis, and a wide variety of human cancers. Previously, we showed that in vivo targeted ablation of β-catenin in melanoma-associated fibroblasts after melanoma formation significantly suppressed tumor growth. However, when the expression of β-catenin was ablated in melanoma-associated fibroblasts before tumor initiation, melanoma development was surprisingly accelerated. How stromal β-catenin deficiency leads to opposite biological effects in melanoma progression is not completely understood. Here, we report that β-catenin is indispensable for the activation of primary human stromal fibroblasts and the mediation of fibroblast-melanoma cell interactions. Using coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, we identified Yes-associated protein (YAP) as an important β-catenin-interacting partner in stromal fibroblasts. YAP is highly expressed in the nuclei of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in both human and murine melanomas. Mechanistic investigation revealed that YAP nuclear translocation is significantly modulated by Wnt/β-catenin activity in fibroblasts. Blocking Wnt/β-catenin signaling in stromal fibroblasts inhibited YAP nuclear translocation. In the absence of YAP, the ability of stromal fibroblasts to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) was inhibited, which is consistent with the phenotype observed in cells with β-catenin deficiency. Further studies showed that the expression of ECM proteins and enzymes required for remodeling the ECM was suppressed in stromal fibroblasts after YAP ablation. Collectively, our data provide a new paradigm in which the β-catenin-YAP signaling axis regulates the activation and tumor-promoting function of stromal fibroblasts.                © The Author(s) 2019.	
20825570        	Nevus trichilemmocysticus: report of a new case of a recently recognized entity.            	A new type of organoid epidermal nevus, characterized by the presence of multiple trichilemmal cysts disposed in a linear arrangement, was recently recognized and named nevus trichilemmocysticus. We report a 10-year-old girl with a congenital linear dermatosis affecting the head, neck, trunk, limbs, palms, and soles. Initially, the lesions that followed the lines of Blaschko consisted of yellowish plaques covered by verrucous papules and filiform hyperkeratoses. Additionally, since the age of 6 years, numerous cyst-like structures developed on the linear lesions involving the limbs. On histopathological examination, all of the excised cystic lesions were found to be trichilemmal cysts. Hence, we herein describe a new case of nevus trichilemmocysticus.                © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	
20421921        	Malignant precursor cells pre-exist in human breast DCIS and require autophagy for survival.            	While it is accepted that a majority of invasive breast cancer progresses from a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) precursor stage, very little is known about the factors that promote survival of DCIS neoplastic cells within the hypoxic, nutrient deprived intraductal microenvironment.                We examined the hypothesis that fresh human DCIS lesions contain pre-existing carcinoma precursor cells. We characterized these cells by full genome molecular cytogenetics (Illumina HumanCytoSNP profile), and signal pathway profiling (Reverse Phase Protein Microarray, 59 endpoints), and demonstrated that autophagy is required for survival and anchorage independent growth of the cytogenetically abnormal tumorigenic DCIS cells. Ex vivo organoid culture of fresh human DCIS lesions, without enzymatic treatment or sorting, induced the emergence of neoplastic epithelial cells exhibiting the following characteristics: a) spontaneous generation of hundreds of spheroids and duct-like 3-D structures in culture within 2-4 weeks; b) tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice; c) cytogenetically abnormal (copy number loss or gain in chromosomes including 1, 5, 6, 8, 13, 17) compared to the normal karyotype of the non-neoplastic cells in the source patient's breast tissue; d) in vitro migration and invasion of autologous breast stroma; and e) up-regulation of signal pathways linked to, and components of, cellular autophagy. Multiple autophagy markers were present in the patient's original DCIS lesion and the mouse xenograft. We tested whether autophagy was necessary for survival of cytogenetically abnormal DCIS cells. The lysosomotropic inhibitor (chloroquine phosphate) of autophagy completely suppressed the generation of DCIS spheroids/3-D structures, suppressed ex vivo invasion of autologous stroma, induced apoptosis, suppressed autophagy associated proteins including Atg5, AKT/PI3 Kinase and mTOR, eliminated cytogenetically abnormal spheroid forming cells from the organ culture, and abrogated xenograft tumor formation.                Cytogenetically abnormal spheroid forming, tumorigenic, and invasive neoplastic epithelial cells pre-exist in human DCIS and require cellular autophagy for survival.	
20098083        	A case of zonal syringocystadenoma papilliferum of the axilla mimicking verruca vulgaris.            	Syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP) most frequently arises from an organoid nevus on the head and neck. Zonal or segmental lesions occurring in other locations are rare. Here, we report a case of a 39-year-old woman with an SCAP clinically mimicking verruca vulgaris in a zonal distribution on her right axilla after her birth. Histopathologic examination showed it to be a typical SCAP. Furthermore, the tumor had a warty surface, which histologically revealed some signs of viral infection. Although polymerase chain reactions for low- and high-risk human papilloma virus types were negative, the relationship of SCAP with viral infection needs further investigation.	
33039352        	Requirement of Bccip for the Regeneration of Intestinal Progenitors.            	BCCIP was originally identified as a BRCA2 and CDKN1A/p21 interaction protein. Although a partial loss of BCCIP function is sufficient to trigger genomic instability and tumorigenesis, complete deletion of BCCIP is lethal to cells. Using Rosa26-CreERT2 mouse models, we found that induced Bccip deletion in adult mice caused an acute intestinal epithelial denudation that cannot be relieved by co-deletion of Trp53. The critical role of Bccip in intestine epithelial renewal was verified with a Villin-CreERT2 mouse model. The epithelium degeneration was associated with a rapid loss of the proliferative capability of the crypt progenitor cells in vivo, lack of crypt base columnar stem cell markers, and a failure of in vitro crypt organoid growth. RNA-Seq analysis of freshly isolated intestinal crypt cells showed that Bccip deletion caused an overwhelming down-regulation of genes involved in mitotic cell division but an up-regulation of genes involved in apoptosis and stress response to microbiomes. Our data not only indicate that intestinal epithelium is the most sensitive tissue to whole-body deletion of Bccip but also point to Bccip as a novel and critical factor for the proliferation of the intestinal progenitors. These findings have significant implications for understanding why a hypomorphic loss of BCCIP functions is more relevant to tumorigenesis.

32996270        	Stimuli-Responsive Biomaterials: Scaffolds for Stem Cell Control.            	Stem cell fate is closely intertwined with microenvironmental and endogenous cues within the body. Recapitulating this dynamic environment ex vivo can be achieved through engineered biomaterials which can respond to exogenous stimulation (including light, electrical stimulation, ultrasound, and magnetic fields) to deliver temporal and spatial cues to stem cells. These stimuli-responsive biomaterials can be integrated into scaffolds to investigate stem cell response in vitro and in vivo, and offer many pathways of cellular manipulation: biochemical cues, scaffold property changes, drug release, mechanical stress, and electrical signaling. The aim of this review is to assess and discuss the current state of exogenous stimuli-responsive biomaterials, and their application in multipotent stem cell control. Future perspectives in utilizing these biomaterials for personalized tissue engineering and directing organoid models are also discussed.                © 2020 The Authors.

21206190        	Intradural lumbar mature teratoma with neuronal and glial tissue component in an adult. Case report.            	A 23-year-old Chinese male patient presented with an extremely rare case of spinal teratoma with neuronal and glial tissue components manifesting as lower back pain and radiating pain to the leg. Subtotal excision of the tumor was conducted. Histological examination revealed a mature teratoma with neuronal and glial tissue components. Initial presentation of spinal teratoma in adulthood is rare. Teratomas show a wide array of organoid tissue differentiation, but neuronal tissue component is uncommon.	
32976654        	NH2 -terminal fragment of ZF21 protein suppresses tumor invasion via inhibiting the interaction of ZF21 with FAK.            	Cellular migration, coupled with the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), is a key step in tumor invasion and represents a promising therapeutic target in malignant tumors. Focal adhesions (FAs) and invadopodia, which are distinct actin-based cellular structures, play key roles in cellular migration and ECM degradation, respectively. The molecular machinery coordinating the dynamics between FAs and invadopodia is not fully understood, although several lines of evidence suggest that the disassembly of FAs is an important step in triggering the formation of invadopodia. In a previous study, we identified the ZF21 protein as a regulator of both FA turnover and invadopodia-dependent ECM degradation. ZF21 interacts with multiple factors for FA turnover, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), microtubules, m-Calpain, and Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2). In particular, the dephosphorylation of FAK by ZF21 is a key event in tumor invasion. However, the precise role of ZF21 binding to FAK remains unclear. We established a method to disrupt the interaction between ZF21 and FAK using the FAK-binding NH2 -terminal region of ZF21. Tumor cells expressing the ZF21-derived polypeptide had significantly decreased FA turnover, migration, invadopodia-dependent ECM degradation, and Matrigel invasion. Furthermore, the expression of the polypeptide inhibited an early step of experimental lung metastasis in mice. These findings indicate that the interaction of ZF21 with FAK is necessary for FA turnover as well as ECM degradation at the invadopodia. Thus, ZF21 is a potential regulator that coordinates the equilibrium between FA turnover and invadopodia activity by interacting with FAK.                © 2020 The Authors.

32052834        	Light or Dark Pigmentation of Engineered Skin Substitutes Containing Melanocytes Protects Against Ultraviolet Light-Induced DNA Damage In Vivo.            	Engineered skin substitutes (ESS) containing autologous fibroblasts and keratinocytes provide stable wound closure in patients with large, full-thickness burns, but are limited by hypopigmentation due to absence of added melanocytes. DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation (UV) increases risk for skin cancer development. In human skin, melanocytes provide pigmentation that protects skin from UV-induced DNA damage. This study investigated whether inclusion of human melanocytes (hM) affects the response of ESS to UV in vivo. Specifically, pigmentation and formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), the most prevalent UV-induced DNA photoproduct, were analyzed. Three groups of ESS were prepared with fibroblasts and keratinocytes, ± melanocytes, and grafted orthotopically to immunodeficient mice: ESS without melanocytes (ESS-hM), ESS with light skin-derived (Caucasian) melanocytes (ESS+hM-L), and ESS with dark skin-derived (African-American) melanocytes (ESS+hM-D). Pigmentation of ESS+hM-L and ESS+hM-D increased significantly after grafting; pigmentation levels were significantly different among groups. Mean melanocyte densities in ESS+hM-L and ESS+hM-D were similar to each other and to densities in normal human skin. After 8 weeks in vivo, grafts were irradiated with 135 mJ/cm2 UV; non-UV-treated mice served as controls. UV modestly increased pigmentation in the ESS+hM groups. UV significantly increased CPD levels in ESS-hM, and levels in ESS-hM were significantly greater than in ESS+hM-L or ESS+hM-D. The results demonstrate that light or dark melanocytes in ESS decreased UV-induced DNA damage. Therefore, melanocytes in ESS play a photoprotective role. Protection against UV-induced DNA damage is expected to reduce skin cancer risk in patients grafted with ESS containing autologous melanocytes.                © American Burn Association 2020.

32556182        	Colonoids From Patients With Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Exhibit Decreased Growth Associated With Inflammation Severity and Durable Upregulation of Antigen Presentation Genes.            	Defining epithelial cell contributions to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is essential for the development of much needed therapies for barrier repair. Children with very early onset (VEO)-IBD have more extensive, severe, and refractory disease than older children and adults with IBD and, in some cases, have defective barrier function. We therefore evaluated functional and transcriptomic differences between pediatric IBD (VEO and older onset) and non-IBD epithelium using 3-dimensional, biopsy-derived organoids.                We measured growth efficiency relative to histopathological and clinical parameters in patient enteroid (ileum) and colonoid (colon) lines. We performed RNA-sequencing on patient colonoids and subsequent flow cytometry after multiple passages to evaluate changes that persisted in culture.                Enteroids and colonoids from pediatric patients with IBD exhibited decreased growth associated with histological inflammation compared with non-IBD controls. We observed increased LYZ expression in colonoids from pediatric IBD patients, which has been reported previously in adult patients with IBD. We also observed upregulation of antigen presentation genes HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRA, which persisted after prolonged passaging in patients with pediatric IBD.                We present the first functional evaluation of enteroids and colonoids from patients with VEO-IBD and older onset pediatric IBD, a subset of which exhibits poor growth. Enhanced, persistent epithelial antigen presentation gene expression in patient colonoids supports the notion that epithelial cell-intrinsic differences may contribute to IBD pathogenesis.                © 2020 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

33537654        	E-cigarettes compromise the gut barrier and trigger inflammation.            	E-cigarette usage continues to rise, yet the safety of e-cigarette aerosols is questioned. Using murine models of acute and chronic e-cigarette aerosol inhalation, murine colon transcriptomics, and murine and human gut-derived organoids in co-culture models, we assessed the effects of e-cigarette use on the gut barrier. Histologic and transcriptome analyses revealed that chronic, but not acute, nicotine-free e-cigarette use increased inflammation and reduced expression of tight junction (TJ) markers. Exposure of murine and human enteroid-derived monolayers (EDMs) to nicotine-free e-cigarette aerosols alone or in co-culture with bacteria also causes barrier disruption, downregulation of TJ protein, and enhanced inflammation in response to infection. These data highlight the harmful effects of "non-nicotine" component of e-cigarettes on the gut barrier. Considering the importance of an intact gut barrier for host fitness and the impact of gut mucosal inflammation on a multitude of chronic diseases, these findings are broadly relevant to both medicine and public health.                © 2021 The Author(s).	
20085740        	Lgr5(+ve) stem cells drive self-renewal in the stomach and build long-lived gastric units in vitro.            	The study of gastric epithelial homeostasis and cancer has been hampered by the lack of stem cell markers and in vitro culture methods. The Wnt target gene Lgr5 marks stem cells in the small intestine, colon, and hair follicle. Here, we investigated Lgr5 expression in the stomach and assessed the stem cell potential of the Lgr5(+ve) cells by using in vivo lineage tracing. In neonatal stomach, Lgr5 was expressed at the base of prospective corpus and pyloric glands, whereas expression in the adult was predominantly restricted to the base of mature pyloric glands. Lineage tracing revealed these Lgr5(+ve) cells to be self-renewing, multipotent stem cells responsible for the long-term renewal of the gastric epithelium. With an in vitro culture system, single Lgr5(+ve) cells efficiently generated long-lived organoids resembling mature pyloric epithelium. The Lgr5 stem cell marker and culture method described here will be invaluable tools for accelerating research into gastric epithelial renewal, inflammation/infection, and cancer.

20417836        	Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors as markers of adult stem cells.            	Molecular markers are used to characterize and track adult stem cells. Colon cancer research has led to the identification of 2 related receptors, leucine-rich repeat-containing, G-protein-coupled receptors (Lgr)5 and Lgr6, that are expressed by small populations of cells in a variety of adult organs. Genetic mouse models have allowed the visualization, isolation, and genetic marking of Lgr5(+ve) and Lgr6(+ve) cells and provided evidence that they are stem cells. The Lgr5(+ve) cells were found to occupy locations not commonly associated with stem cells in the stomach, small intestine, colon, and hair follicles. A multipotent population of skin stem cells express Lgr6. Single Lgr5(+ve) stem cells from the small intestine and the stomach can be cultured into long-lived organoids. Further studies of these markers might reveal adult stem cell populations in additional tissues. Identification of the ligands for Lgr5 and 6 will help elucidate stem cell functions and modes of intracellular signaling.                Copyright 2010 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

31217582        	Noncoding deletions reveal a gene that is critical for intestinal function.            	Large-scale genome sequencing is poised to provide a substantial increase in the rate of discovery of disease-associated mutations, but the functional interpretation of such mutations remains challenging. Here we show that deletions of a sequence on human chromosome 16 that we term the intestine-critical region (ICR) cause intractable congenital diarrhoea in infants1,2. Reporter assays in transgenic mice show that the ICR contains a regulatory sequence that activates transcription during the development of the gastrointestinal system. Targeted deletion of the ICR in mice caused symptoms that recapitulated the human condition. Transcriptome analysis revealed that an unannotated open reading frame (Percc1) flanks the regulatory sequence, and the expression of this gene was lost in the developing gut of mice that lacked the ICR. Percc1-knockout mice displayed phenotypes similar to those observed upon ICR deletion in mice and patients, whereas an ICR-driven Percc1 transgene was sufficient to rescue the phenotypes found in mice that lacked the ICR. Together, our results identify a gene that is critical for intestinal function and underscore the need for targeted in vivo studies to interpret the growing number of clinical genetic findings that do not affect known protein-coding genes.	
32887910        	Maximizing CRISPR/Cas9 phenotype penetrance applying predictive modeling of editing outcomes in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos.            	CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has revolutionized functional genomics in vertebrates. However, CRISPR/Cas9 edited F0 animals too often demonstrate variable phenotypic penetrance due to the mosaic nature of editing outcomes after double strand break (DSB) repair. Even with high efficiency levels of genome editing, phenotypes may be obscured by proportional presence of in-frame mutations that still produce functional protein. Recently, studies in cell culture systems have shown that the nature of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations can be dependent on local sequence context and can be predicted by computational methods. Here, we demonstrate that similar approaches can be used to forecast CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes in Xenopus tropicalis, Xenopus laevis, and zebrafish. We show that a publicly available neural network previously trained in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures (InDelphi-mESC) is able to accurately predict CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes in early vertebrate embryos. Our observations can have direct implications for experiment design, allowing the selection of guide RNAs with predicted repair outcome signatures enriched towards frameshift mutations, allowing maximization of CRISPR/Cas9 phenotype penetrance in the F0 generation.	
31190990        	Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for peritoneal mesothelioma: patient selection and special considerations.            	Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare, aggressive malignancy that typically presents with vague symptoms, ascites, and/or diffuse peritoneal studding. Despite findings of advanced disease within the peritoneal cavity, spread beyond the abdomen is uncommon. Although advances in systemic chemotherapy have been made, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) remain the mainstay of treatment. Median overall survival of approximately 50 months with CRS/HIPEC has been demonstrated, with age, gender, histologic subtype, peritoneal carcinomatosis index, comorbidities, nodal and extra-abdominal metastases, and completeness of cytoreduction all playing a role in prognosis. In patients with refractory malignant ascites and unresectable disease, complete resolution of ascites and improvement in quality of life have been demonstrated with palliative HIPEC. In appropriately selected patients, CRS/HIPEC plays a critical role in the treatment and palliation of MPM.	
32000541        	High-Throughput In Vitro, Ex Vivo, and In Vivo Screen of Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors Based on Physical and Functional Transduction.            	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are quickly becoming the vectors of choice for therapeutic gene delivery. To date, hundreds of natural isolates and bioengineered variants have been reported. While factors such as high production titer and low immunoreactivity are important to consider, the ability to deliver the genetic payload (physical transduction) and to drive high transgene expression (functional transduction) remains the most important feature when selecting AAV variants for clinical applications. Reporter expression assays are the most commonly used methods for determining vector fitness. However, such approaches are time consuming and become impractical when evaluating a large number of variants. Limited access to primary human tissues or challenging model systems further complicates vector testing. To address this problem, convenient high-throughput methods based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) are being developed. To this end, we built an AAV Testing Kit that allows inherent flexibility in regard to number and type of AAV variants included, and is compatible with in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo applications. The Testing Kit presented here consists of a mix of 30 known AAVs where each variant encodes a CMV-eGFP cassette and a unique barcode in the 3'-untranslated region of the eGFP gene, allowing NGS-barcode analysis at both the DNA and RNA/cDNA levels. To validate the AAV Testing Kit, individually packaged barcoded variants were mixed at an equal ratio and used to transduce cells/tissues of interest. DNA and RNA/cDNA were extracted and subsequently analyzed by NGS to determine the physical/functional transduction efficiencies. We were able to assess the transduction efficiencies of immortalized cells, primary cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro, as well as in vivo transduction in naïve mice and a xenograft liver model. Importantly, while our data validated previously reported transduction characteristics of individual capsids, we also identified novel previously unknown tropisms for some AAV variants.	
32203463        	Gene network transitions in embryos depend upon interactions between a pioneer transcription factor and core histones.            	Gene network transitions in embryos and other fate-changing contexts involve combinations of transcription factors. A subset of fate-changing transcription factors act as pioneers; they scan and target nucleosomal DNA and initiate cooperative events that can open the local chromatin. However, a gap has remained in understanding how molecular interactions with the nucleosome contribute to the chromatin-opening phenomenon. Here we identified a short α-helical region, conserved among FOXA pioneer factors, that interacts with core histones and contributes to chromatin opening in vitro. The same domain is involved in chromatin opening in early mouse embryos for normal development. Thus, local opening of chromatin by interactions between pioneer factors and core histones promotes genetic programming.	
32084390        	Ascl2-Dependent Cell Dedifferentiation Drives Regeneration of Ablated Intestinal Stem Cells.            	Ablation of LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) is associated with rapid restoration of the ISC compartment. Different intestinal crypt populations dedifferentiate to provide new ISCs, but the transcriptional and signaling trajectories that guide this process are unclear, and a large body of work suggests that quiescent "reserve" ISCs contribute to regeneration. By timing the interval between LGR5+ lineage tracing and lethal injury, we show that ISC regeneration is explained nearly completely by dedifferentiation, with contributions from absorptive and secretory progenitors. The ISC-restricted transcription factor ASCL2 confers measurable competitive advantage to resting ISCs and is essential to restore the ISC compartment. Regenerating cells re-express Ascl2 days before Lgr5, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses reveal transcriptional paths underlying dedifferentiation. ASCL2 target genes include the interleukin-11 (IL-11) receptor Il11ra1, and recombinant IL-11 enhances crypt cell regenerative potential. These findings reveal cell dedifferentiation as the principal means for ISC restoration and highlight an ASCL2-regulated signal that enables this adaptive response.

28132905        	Towards better models and mechanistic biomarkers for drug-induced gastrointestinal injury.            	Adverse drug reactions affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are a serious burden on patients, healthcare providers and the pharmaceutical industry. GI toxicity encompasses a range of pathologies in different parts of the GI tract. However, to date no specific mechanistic diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers or translatable pre-clinical models of GI toxicity exist. This review will cover the current knowledge of GI ADRs, existing biomarkers and models with potential application for toxicity screening/monitoring. We focus on the current gaps in our knowledge, the potential opportunities and recommend that a systematic approach is needed to identify mechanism-based GI biomarkers with potential for clinical translation.
