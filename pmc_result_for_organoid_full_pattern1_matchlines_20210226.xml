33120912	        <p>To determine how exosomes derived from CRC cells affect vascular endothelial cells during the invasion of tumor cells into the vascular lumen, exosomes were collected by ultracentrifugation from the culture medium of KM12-SM cells, a highly metastatic colon cancer cell line of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-biology-09-00361">29</xref>]. The size of the collected microvesicles was measured using NanoSight (NS-10, Malvern, UK), and it was confirmed that each vesicle size was compatible with exosomes (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biology-09-00361">Figure S2A</xref>). Exosomes were labeled with PKH67 dye and were incorporated into the cytoplasm of HUVEC cells in the coculture of HUVECs and exosomes (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biology-09-00361">Figure S2B</xref>). Although the effect of exosomes exposed to the formation of vascular networks was studied, no significant difference was observed in vessel volume in the fibrin gel (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biology-09-00361">Figure S2C</xref>). Then, exosome-exposed HUVECs were cocultured with cancer cells in the gel, and the degree of invasion by the cancer cells was studied. The proportion of cancer cells that invaded vessels was significantly higher in the exosome-exposed group than in the nonexposed control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00361-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). To study the enhancement mechanism of cancer cell invasion into the vascular lumen by exosomes, immunohistochemical analysis of p120 and VE-cadherin was performed in the vessels, which are reportedly tight-junction-related proteins in the vascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-biology-09-00361">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-biology-09-00361">31</xref>]. To study the involvement of cancer cells in the expression of these proteins, vascular organoids were cultured using HUVECs exposed to exosomes, but the HUVECs did not contain cancer cells in the gel; then, the expression of each protein was studied by fluorescence staining and signal volume calculation. The expression of VE-cadherin in the vascular endothelium was significantly lower in the exosome-exposed group than in the nonexposed control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00361-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D). Similarly, the expression of the p120 protein in the vascular endothelium was significantly lower in the exosome-exposed group than in the nonexposed control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00361-f004">Figure 4</xref>E,F). These results suggested that cancer-derived exosomes reduced vascular endothelium tight junctions and increased the vascular permeability of cancer cells. Clinical open database analysis, using the PROGgeneV2 database and dataset GSE28814, confirmed that metastasis-free survival (MFS) was significantly higher in the p120 high-expression group than that in the low-expression group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00361-f004">Figure 4</xref>G). This suggested that MFS might be affected by exosomes derived from cancer cells, following the alteration of tight junctions.</p>

33377086	        <p id="p0990">Depending on the amount of starting material and on the percentage of viable epithelial cells in the culture, outgrowth efficiency can vary. Some tumor samples grow equally well on both tumor mediums (as the culture shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>A). However, others grow better in only one of the tumor medium (such as the organoid culture sample 2 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>B) or in neither of the tumor mediums (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>C). For a flowchart, for decision taking, on expansion of cultures on different mediums, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>D. Growth rates between samples derived from different patients vary. For the first passage, wait until 80% of the organoids are larger than 50–70 μm before processing them for next passage. This usually takes around 14–21 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows organoids grown from isolated primary material that are ready to be passaged). To determine the split ratio and frequency of a newly established culture, as a rule of thumb, pancreatic normal organoids can generally be passaged 1:2–1:3 every 7–10 days. Pancreatic tumor organoids can be passaged 1:2–1:6 every 7–10 days. Work in a conservative way, rather plating the organoids dense (with a low split ratio) than seeding them too sparse. You can always dilute further once the organoids start growing and the density turns out to be too high. In general, organoid cultures (especially normal cultures) do not take it well when they are diluted too much. In newly established cultures, from which the passage rate is not yet determined, closely monitor the culture for the first days after passaging. If organoids in the center of Matrigel/BME drops are dying, this is an indication that the organoids were seeded too densely. Two examples of this are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A. If this phenomenon is observed, re-seed organoids in a larger volume of Matrigel/BME without passaging the organoids. Let the organoids grow until they reach the desired size before being disrupted for passaging. As mentioned above, organoid cultures derived from different patients differ in their growth rate and optimal passage density. However, to get a general idea of suitable passaging densities, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>B–4D show representative bright-field images of three different pancreatic tumor organoid cultures right after passaging. The second panel then shows the result of the plating after passaging. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>B shows a cystic culture that was plated at a density that was too low. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D show examples of correct seeding densities for a cystic culture and a compact culture, respectively.<list id="olist0110" list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0390"><label>31.</label><p id="p0995">For passaging, pipette the culture medium present in the wells up and down to disrupt the Matrigel/BME drops.</p></list-item></list><disp-quote><p><bold><italic>Note:</italic></bold> If the organoid medium contains cell debris, do not resuspend using the culture medium.

27221051	        <p>To gain further insight into the role of TGFβ signaling at the early stages of tumor development <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated gene expression data from a set of TA and SSA polyps (GSE45270 and GSE79460) and analyzed the expression of the five most strongly induced and five most strongly reduced genes upon TGFβ treatment of TA organoid cultures. The expression of these genes followed the expected pattern, meaning genes induced upon TGFβ treatment were more highly expressed in SSAs, while the downregulated genes could be detected at higher levels in TAs (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="emmm201606184-fig-0004">4</xref>A). Applying an <italic>in vitro</italic> TGFβ response signature from TGFβ‐treated organoid cultures to gene expression data from SSAs and TAs revealed that this signature was able to segregate SSA from TA samples (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="emmm201606184-fig-0004">4</xref>B). Additionally, this epithelial cell‐derived TGFβ signature was capable of clustering most of the CMS4 samples of the AMC‐AJCCII‐90 dataset apart from CMS1‐3 tumor samples (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="emmm201606184-fig-0002ev">EV2</xref>B) (GSE33113, De Sousa E Melo <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="emmm201606184-bib-0014">2011</xref>). GSEA confirmed the higher expression of the TGFβ signature genes in SSA lesions and CMS4 tumors (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="emmm201606184-fig-0002ev">EV2</xref>A). As the TGFβ signature is able to identify CMS4 tumors that reportedly display worse RFS (Guinney <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="emmm201606184-bib-0022">2015</xref>), we speculated that this signature would be able to predict RFS.

Stage IV patients were excluded from the TCGA dataset for this analysis. The samples in both datasets were divided into TGFβ signature low and high groups using the Pearson correlation with the 231‐gene TGFβ signature derived from the TA organoid cultures. Samples with a correlation &gt; 0.1 were assigned to the TGFβ high group and samples with a correlation &lt; −0.1 to the TGFβ low group. The survival distributions of the two groups were compared with the log‐rank test.</p>

Reads were then aligned to mm10 genome using the Galaxy portal maintained by the Broad Institute for Drop-Seq alignment using standard settings. Individual reads were tagged according to the 12 bp barcode sequencing and the 8 bp UMI contained in Read 1 of each fragment. Following alignment, reads were binned onto 12 bp cell barcodes and collapsed by their 8 bp UMI. Digital gene expression matrices (e.g., cell by gene tables) for each sample were obtained from quality filtered and mapped reads and UMI-collapsed data, were deposited in GSE100274, and were utilized as input into Seurat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://github.com/satijalab/seurat">https://github.com/satijalab/seurat</ext-link>) for further analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p>

32068945	        <p>Snap frozen cell/organoid pellets were lysed with the QIAShredder columns (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit including a DNA digestion step. Subsequently, RNA concentration was assessed on a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen) using a Qubit™ RNA HS Assay Kit and samples were loaded on a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical, DNF‐471‐0500 Standard Sensitivity RNA Analysis Kit [15 nt]) to determine RNA quality. RNA samples were diluted to 20 ng/mL for RNA sequencing and frozen at −80°C. Samples were processed with the TruSeq RNA sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, Inc., California). RNA samples (100–1,000 ng) were polyA‐enriched, reverse‐transcribed into double‐stranded cDNA and fragmented followed by end‐repair, polyadenylation and ligation of TruSeq adapters containing multiplex‐indices. Subsequently, fragments containing TruSeq adapters were selectively enriched by PCR and quality and quantity of the enriched libraries were analysed using a Qubit 1.0 fluorometer and the Calliper GX LabChip® GX (Calliper Life Sciences, Inc.). The libraries were normalised to 10 nM in Tris‐Cl 10 mM, pH 8.5 with 0.1% Tween 20. Cluster generation was performed with TruSeq PR Cluster Kit (Illumina, Inc., California) using 10 pM of the pooled normalised libraries on the cBOT. Sequencing was performed using the TruSeq SBS Kit HS4000 (Illumina, Inc., California) on an Illumina HiSeq 4,000 single end 125 bp. The transcriptome data set was uploaded to the GEO data base (Accession number GSE140703).</p>
32068945	        <p>OpenSWATH (Röst et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cmi13191-bib-0070">2014</xref>) was used to identify peptides from all SWATH maps with statistical control at 1% FDR and then to align between SWATH maps using a novel TRIC with requantification option enabled (TRansfer of Identification Confidence; Röst et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cmi13191-bib-0071">2016</xref>). Because we had nine samples for tissue and epithelium type of samples analysed in this dataset (18 samples for organoid type), to further increase the protein confidence, only those peptide signals identified in more than eight samples were accepted for protein identification and quantification. To quantify the protein abundance levels across samples, we used the Top3 method (Grossmann et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cmi13191-bib-0031">2010</xref>; Liu et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cmi13191-bib-0047">2015</xref>; Ludwig, Claassen, Schmidt, &amp; Aebersold, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cmi13191-bib-0050">2012</xref>; Williams et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cmi13191-bib-0092">2016</xref>). The quantitative protein matrix was rounded to the full integer value for further analysis. The input for the downstream analysis of the protein expression data was the matrix obtained by applying TMM‐normalisation to the raw count matrix. The proteome data set was uploaded to the PRIDE database (project ID PXD016339).</p>

32396494	        <p>Raw signal intensity values were initially QC’d and pre-processed from subsequent idat files in R statistical environment (v3.6.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit0034">34</xref>] using the minfi Bioconductor package (v1.32.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit0035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit0036">36</xref>]. Quality control steps were applied to minimize errors and remove poor probe signals. Potential labelling errors were discerned by examining methylation status at sex chromosomes of each individual. Problematic probes such as failed probes (detection p value &gt;0.01), cross-reacting probes, and probes that overlapped single nucleotide variants within ± 1 bp of CpG sites were removed. Background correction and dye-based normalization were performed using ssNoob algorithm (single-sample normal-exponential out-of-band). Lastly, all sex chromosome probes were discarded. Final DNA methylation values for each CpG represented as β-values were analysed. Downstream analyses were performed under the R statistical environment (v3.6.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="cit0034">34</xref>].

33240885	        <p>DNA isolation was conducted using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit (A1120, Promega) following mechanical dissociation of enteroids from Matrigel via trituration. RNA isolation was conducted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (84004, Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion after mechanical dissociation of enteroids from Matrigel via trituration and a 15 min 4°C incubation in 2 mM EDTA with three subsequent washes in cold DPBS. RNA concentration and quality were determined using a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent), and prepared for library generation with Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit (634876, Takara Bio USA).

31028424	        <p id="Par40">It is widely accepted that EV secretion increases in tumors compared to normal tissues. However, whether this can be attributed to mutations is not yet known. Since CRC cells represent a late stage of tumorigenesis and carry a wide variety of mutations, we used a mouse model with well-defined genetic background. We introduced <italic>Apc</italic> mutation into wild-type (WT) small intestinal organoids by CRISPR-Cas9 and we selected <italic>Apc</italic>-mutant organoids, representing the adenoma stage of intestinal tumors, without adding the external Wnt-agonist R-Spondin1. Since WT intestinal stem cells are strictly dependent on R-Spondin1, only <italic>Apc</italic>-mutant organoids survive after 5 days under these conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a). Interestingly, we observed a massive increase in CD81 + EV secretion after <italic>Apc</italic> mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>b). One possible explanation for the increased EV release after <italic>Apc</italic> mutation is an elevated expression of genes involved in this process. Unfortunately, no single gene is responsible for EV release and different EV pathways may operate in different cell types. Exosomes (EX) are specific EVs of endosomal origin with the best characterized routes of production and secretion among EV types. To test whether the EX route is responsible for the enhanced EV secretion, we selected 39 genes with proved function in multi-vesicular body (MVB) formation and EX release (e.g., specific Rab proteins) (Table S6). This gene set was used in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on publicly available expression data derived from organoid libraries (GSE74843) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Importantly, these organoid libraries contain only cells of epithelial origin, thus excluding stroma-derived signals. As expected, we observed a positive enrichment of the Wnt-target gene set and KEGG cell cycle genes in the human adenoma samples compared to normal organoids (Fig. S5a). However, the EX biogenesis gene set showed a negative enrichment (Fig. S5a). To rule out the possibility that the EX biogenesis gene set behaves differentially in humans and mice, we repeated our analysis on expression data sets derived from microdissected WT intestinal epithelial cells and <italic>Apc</italic>-mutant adenomas derived from mouse (GSE422). Again, we found no positive enrichment of the EX biogenesis gene set in the adenoma samples (Fig. S5b), suggesting that the increased EV release after <italic>Apc</italic> mutation is not a consequence of the higher expression level of EX biogenesis genes in this system.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Mouse intestinal organoids release a higher amount of EVs after <italic>Apc</italic> mutation. <bold>a</bold> Morphology of mouse intestinal organoids before (left and middle images) and after <italic>Apc</italic> mutation (right panel).

The gene expression profile with 20,014 genes were obtained after removing probes corresponding to multiple genes and averaging the expression level of multiple probes of each gene.</p>
32117908	        <p>We collected the transcriptomes of five types of engineered organoids which expressed mutations of different combinations of the five genes from <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" ns0:href="GSE57965">GSE57965</ext-link>. For each type of engineered organoid, we calculated the activities of 50 hallmark signatures from MSigDB and identified the hallmark signatures with significant activation or inactivation using gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2005</xref>; Liberzon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2015</xref>). In A-organoid, epithelial mesenchymal transition was the most significantly activated development signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">Figure S2A</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The immune signatures [IL6- JAK-STAT3 signaling (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0012) and inflammatory response (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001)] also showed significant activation. Five of six proliferation signatures showed significant activation in AK-organoid, which contained G2M checkpoint (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and E2F targets (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In AKST- and AKSTP-organoids, the hypoxia and glycolysis signature showed significant activation. Notably, none of 50 hallmark signatures showed significant inactivation in AKSTP-organoid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">Figure S2B</xref>), indicating AKSTP-organoid exhibited more cancer hallmarks. These results suggested that the introduction of the five driver genes in intestinal organoids could induce the activation of hallmark signatures.</p>

28232471	        <p>Samples were collected in 1 ml of TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −80°C. RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA mini kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA quality was assessed on a bioanalyzer using the Agilent RNA 600 Nano kit. We used poly-A pull-down to enrich for mRNAs from total RNA samples (0.2–1 µg per sample, RIN &gt; 8) and proceeded to library preparation using Illumina TruSeq RNA prep kit. Libraries were then sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000 at the Columbia Genome Center. We multiplexed samples in each lane, which yielded targeted number of single-end 100-bp reads for each sample, as a fraction of 180 million reads for the whole lane. We used RTA (Illumina) for base calling and bcl2fastq (version 1.8.4) for converting BCL to fastq format, coupled with adaptor trimming. We mapped the reads to a reference genome (Human, NCBI/build37.2; Mouse, UCSC/mm9) using Tophat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>; version 2.0.4) with 4 mismatches (–read-mismatches = 4) and 10 maximum multiple hits (–max-multihits = 10). To tackle the mapping issue of reads that are from exon–exon junctions, Tophat infers novel exon–exon junctions ab initio, and combined them with junctions from known mRNA sequences (refgenes) as the reference annotation. We estimated the relative abundance (i.e., expression level) of genes and splice isoforms using cufflinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>; version 2.0.2) with default settings.

30996297	        <p id="Par7">Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a contributing factor to CRC. To elucidate which factors are involved in UC, we performed genomic analysis of previously reported gene expression data [GSE14580, GSE36807, and GSE47908; Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in the National Center for Biotechnology Information]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To explore for genes differentially expressed in UC, we compared normal colon to UC samples by applying class comparison analysis. We found 893 genes that were potentially UC correlated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). As expected, since UC is highly correlated with inflammation, genes (MMPs, CXCLs, STATs, and IL-8) associated with inflammation were significantly up-modulated in UC patients. Genes involved in glycolysis such as PFKFB3, PKM, and PFKP were highly increased in UC patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). Previous reports demonstrate that PFKFB3 is associated with UC and CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, there has been little characterization of the function of PKM in inflammation-induced CRC. We thus focused on PKM function in UC and CRC. First, we examined PKM expression in the colon tissues of CRC patients. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>, PKM expression in those tissues was significantly higher than in normal tissue. We next investigated the clinical relevance of PKM and CRC. Patient cohorts from the GEO were dichotomized according to PKM expression. Patients with higher PKM levels had poor clinical outcomes and vice versa across multiple sample sets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>), consistent with an oncogenic function of PKM in CRC. Others have reported that PKM2 is the predominant isoform in normal colon epithelial cells and colon cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We also found that mRNA levels of PKM2, but not PKM1, were highly expressed in both human normal and cancer colon tissues (data not shown). Thus, we can speculate that PKM from gene expression profile data represent PKM2 rather than PKM1. To determine whether PKM2 expression is changed during inflammation and colon oncogenesis, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to validate expression of PKM2 in UC and CRC. Indeed, PKM2 expression was increased in UC tissues and greater yet in dysplastic tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). Moreover, in CRC patients, the expression of Lgr5, the cancer stem cell marker, was positively correlated with PKM expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>). These results suggest that PKM2 expression is increased during inflammation-induced CRC development, either as a consequence of oncogenic transformation or as a metabolic oncogene.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>PKM2 expression and clinical implication in ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC).

32393270	        <p id="Par53">We first used qRT-PCR to detect the expression of TROJAN in 16 paired ER+ breast cancer and normal breast tissue samples. The expression of TROJAN was significantly higher in tumor tissue than in paratumor normal tissue (Additional files <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, Fig. S1a). We used qRT-PCR to measure the expression of TROJAN in another ER+ breast cancer cohort that included survival information. With an optimal cutoff point determined by X-tile statistical software, we confirmed that TROJAN was associated with reduced relapse-free survival (RFS) among ER+ breast cancer patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a). In TCGA database, TROJAN (we used the ENST00000624228.1 transcript as a substitution in GEPIA2) was associated with reduced disease-free survival in ER+ breast cancer patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>b). Similarly, in kmplot.com [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], TROJAN (we used the 242346_x_at probe set as a substitution) was also associated with reduced disease-free survival in ER+ breast cancer patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>c). We included tumor size, lymph node metastasis, grade (only included in FUSCC cohort) and TROJAN expression in multivariate cox regression analysis in FUSCC and TCGA cohort (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>d).

32393270	        <p id="Par58">To investigate the downstream targets regulated by TROJAN, we reanalyzed the microarray data from MCF7 cells with TROJAN knockdown and from 21 ER+ breast cancer patients published previously (GSE115144) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In total, 694 genes were down regulated by TROJAN knockdown, and 51 genes were positively correlated with TROJAN (R &gt; 0.2, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in both FUSCC and TCGA cohort, including eight cell cycle-related genes according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>a). Among these genes (CCNA2, MCM7, CDC45, CDK2, MCM3, PCNA, BUB1 and MCM6), we were most interested in CDK2, which was reported to be activated in PD-resistant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We hypothesized that CDK2 is a key target gene of TROJAN. In MCF7 PDR cells, we observed significant decreased of PD IC50 after CDK2 knockdown (Additional files <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Fig. S5a-b). We next validated that the mRNA expression level of CDK2 was increased by the knockdown of TROJAN and was decreased by the knockdown of NKRF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>b). Importantly, the knockdown of both TROJAN and NKRF restored the expression of CDK2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>c). Based on the luciferase reporter assay, the promoter activity of CDK2 was inhibited by TROJAN knockdown, while the promoter activity was activated by NKRF knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>d). Importantly, the CDK2 level and the total amount of CDK Thr160 phosphorylation level decreased upon TROJAN knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>e), indicating that CDK2 was inactivated. The expression of CDK2 was increased upon TROJAN overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>f). In a mammary fat pad xenograft model, we found that the expression of CDK2 was decreased in TROJAN knockdown tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>g). Previous research has shown that NKRF has DNA-binding activity and represses the transcription of its target genes through interactions with other NF-κB factors at the promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Through a public ChIP-Seq dataset (GSE31477), RELA could bind to the promoter of CDK2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>h) and overlapped with the H3K27ac and H3K4me3 signal (Additional files <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Fig. S5c). We inferred that TROJAN and NKRF could regulate the promoter activity of CDK2 and could alter the expression of CDK2 at the transcriptional level. Using a ChIP assay, we observed a significant increase in the NKRF binding capacity at the CDK2 promoter after TROJAN knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>i). Similar to previous studies, we observed that PDR cells had sustained high levels of CDK2 Thr160 and RB1 S807/811 phosphorylation despite CDK4/6 inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>j) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the knockdown of TROJAN in PDR cells abrogated the phosphorylation of CDK2 and RB1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>k). We observed that the overexpression of CDK2 in TROJAN knockdown MCF7 cells could partially revert the proliferative inhibition compared to TROJAN knock down cells. However, the subsequent CDK2 silencing in TROJAN knockdown MCF7 cells did not affect proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>l). Taken together, these data indicate that TROJAN prevents NKRF binding at the CDK2 promoter and can regulate the expression level of CDK2 at the transcriptional level.

Additionally, the anti-TROJAN ASO we identified decreased TROJAN expression as well as impaired the proliferation and metastatic ability of TNBC in vivo. As measured by biochemical parameters, such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and blood urea in ASO-treated mice, ASO therapy was proven to have limited toxicity. In this report, we established that TROJAN is highly expressed in ER+ breast cancer tissues and predicts poor survival. The inhibition of TROJAN impaired proliferation through cell cycle G1/S phase arrest. These results led us to investigate the effectiveness of a combination therapy with an anti-TROJAN ASO and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Importantly, the in vitro and in vivo assays showed that the anti-TROJAN ASO combined with PD significantly suppressed tumor growth compared with that of either single agent. Two previous studies showed that a potential molecular mechanism of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors was the noncanonical activation of CDK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The efficacy of CDK2 inhibitors was not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. One pan-CDK inhibitor, dinaciclib (targeting CDK2, CDK5, CDK1 and CDK9), was still in phase 1 clinical trials (NCT03484520, NCT03484520, NCT01676753, NCT01676753, NCT02684617 and NCT02684617) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, novel CDK2 inhibitors still need to be developed. Here, our research showed that the inhibition of TROJAN decreased the expression of CDK2 as well as its phosphorylation, and the inactivation of CDK2 mediated cell cycle entry. Our findings support the use of a strategy that inhibits CDK2/4/6 to overcome resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. These data suggested that the anti-TROJAN ASO with PD might be a promising novel combination for treating ER+ breast cancer patients. Clearly, the widespread molecular profiling of patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitors will be required to validate our results.</p>

GSE32269 series consists of 22 primary PCa (hormone-dependent) and 29 mCRPC acquired using the GPL96 platform (Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array). GSE101607 compares eight HSPC vs. 40 mCRPC acquired using the GPL10558 platform (Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip). There are five primary PCa and three mCRPC in GSE3325, which were produced using the GPL570 platform (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array). We also downloaded GSE74685, which contains data pertaining to 149 visceral and bone metastases from 62 mCRPC patients.</p>

The sva package supports the use of sva functions for proxy variable estimation, the ComBat function to directly adjust known batch effects, and the fsva function to adjust batch and latent variables in predictive problems. Class comparison analysis for DEGs was conducted with the limma Bioconductor package (R version 3.5.1) and DEGs with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |log<sub>2</sub>FC| &gt;1 were selected for further analysis.

According to the expression of SPP1 in GSE32269, GSE101607, and GSE3325 data sets (35 HSPC and 72 mCRPC samples), the data sets were divided into SPP1 low-expressed datasets and SPP1 high-expressed datasets. Single-gene GSEA was analyzed to identify the pathways regulated by SPP1. The androgen receptor signaling pathway is significantly enriched.</p>
31620371	        <p>According to the bioinformatics analysis described above, SPP1 was the key hub ECM gene for the development of mCRPC, and SPP1 mRNA expression was also most significantly dysregulated among the six ECM signatures. SPP1, also known as Osteopontin (OPN), is an important secretory phosphorylated glycoprotein producted by both tumor cells and a variety of host cells, including multiple immune cells, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, endothelial, smooth muscle and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). SPP1-induced interaction between tumor cells and stromal cells promotes tumor progression and angiogenesis, and drug resistance. However, there are rare studies of OPN mediated drug resistance of prostate cancer, and the role of SPP1 in mCRPC is still elucidated. Bone metastasis frequently occurs in majority of patients with PCa, which lead to devastating complications due to skeletal-related events (SREs) and reducing patients' survival. Expression of SPP1 varied in different metastatic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), and especially high expression of SPP1 was observed in bone metastasis. Actually, SPP1 could promote bone metastasis progression by stimulating immune cells, activating endothelial cells and fibroblasts, and regulating osteoclasts and osteoblasts mediated formation and resorption in the bone microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). According to the expression of SPP1 in GSE32269, GSE101607, and GSE3325 data sets (35 HSPC and 72 mCRPC samples), the data sets were divided into SPP1 low-expressed datasets and SPP1 high-expressed datasets. Based on GSEA results, SPP1 could significantly regulated androgen receptor signaling pathway in high-expression group, which has been considered as the main driver of CRPC progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> showed the results of IHC for HSPC and mCRPC organoids with the SPP1-specific monoclonal antibody.

Therefore, SPP1 mRNA and protein levels were highly elevated in mCRPC organoids.</p>

Until recently, the early steps in this process could not faithfully be analyzed in vitro because CRC cell lines are usually derived from advanced carcinomas. In contrast, organoids can be established from normal tissue and any stage of malignant progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sato et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2011b</xref>). Thus, organoids are well suited to study oncogene interaction in intestinal cells.</p><p>CRC is most frequently initiated by mutations activating the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway, such as by loss of the tumor suppressor and β-catenin regulator adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or by mutations in β-catenin that prevent degradation. These mutations stabilize stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>). Functional loss of APC and stabilizing mutations in β-catenin have similar effects in intestinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farrall et al., 2012</xref>). The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade is often activated during CRC progression, frequently by hotspot mutations in the catalytic kinase subunit PIK3CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Parsons et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>).

Images of cultures were taken with a Biozero microscope using a Plan Fluor extra-long working distance DM 20× C 0.45 NA objective and Biozero observation and Analyser software (Keyence).</p><p>The following growth factors, inducers, and small-molecule inhibitors were used: EGF (50 ng/ml; PeproTech), insulin-like growth factor (100 ng/ml; PeproTech), hepatocyte growth factor (50 ng/ml; PeproTech), TGFα (10 ng/ml; PeproTech), noggin (100 ng/ml; PeproTech); doxycycline (2 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), Y-27632 (10 µM; Sigma-Aldrich), AZD6244 (10 µM; SelleckChem), GDC0941 (1 µM; SelleckChem), CHIR99021 (6 µM; SelleckChem), MK2206 (250 nM; SelleckChem), rapamycin (100 nM; SelleckChem), and Torin1 (4 µM; SelleckChem). Stocks were dissolved in either 70% EtOH (doxycycline), <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidon (Torin1), or DMSO (all others), and solvent concentrations were kept uniform across all wells in the experiments. Sublethal concentrations for inhibitors for cell signal transduction were determined in noninduced cultures. For signal inhibition experiments, inhibitors were added to already doxycycline-induced cultures.</p><p>For quantification of organoid proliferation, cultures were induced for 4 d. Cells were counted in well multiples after disaggregation using a Neubauer chamber. DNA content was determined using components of the CellTox Green Cytotoxicity Assay (G8741; Promega) as given in the Metabolic assays section. For clonogenicity assays, 15 or 150 cells per well were seeded into Matrigel domes in 48-well plates with CCM-REN + Y27632, and organoid colonies were counted after 8 d. To systematically analyze the 2D attachment phenotype, cultures were disaggregated, seeded in 50% Matrigel onto precooled culture plates, and transferred to 37°C after 5 min. Time-lapse assays were performed in an Incucyte Zoom device (Essen Bioscience) using the 10× objective and the phase contrast and red fluorescent channels. Organoid colony outgrowth and survival were quantified from time-lapse videos from &gt;3 wells per condition, and only colonies that survived for 4 d were counted. Colonies fusing during the examination period were counted as separate colonies. Transwell motility and invasion assays were performed with a Chemotaxis system (IncuCyte ClearView 96-Well Chemotaxis Plate; 4582; Essen Bioscience) as per manufacturers’ application note. Wells were coated with 50 µg/ml Matrigel. Pore size of the transwell plates was 8 µM.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Protein analysis</title><p>For protein/phosphoprotein analysis from organoids, a WES capillary Western system (12–230 kD Master kit α-Rabbit–HRP; PS-MK01; Protein Simple) was used. In brief, organoids were collected in cold PBS and spun down, and Matrigel was removed. Organoids were taken up in 25-µl M-Per lysis buffer (78501; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors (PhosSTOP EASYpack phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets; 04906837001; and Complete EDTA-free phosphatase inhibitor tablets; 11873580001; Roche), left on ice for 30 min, and subsequently frozen at −80°C. After thawing, samples were sonicated and spun down, and the protein content of the supernatants was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays. Depending on the size of the analyte, either cofilin or vinculin were used to normalize the readout from each capillary. The following rabbit-derived antibodies were used: pAKT<sup>T308</sup> (1:50; 2965), pAKT<sup>S473</sup> (1:50; 9271), pGSK3β<sup>S9</sup> (1:50; 9336), pS6RB<sup>S240/S244</sup> (1:50; 5364), p4EBP1<sup>T37/T46</sup>, (1:50; 2855), pERK1/2<sup>T202/Y204</sup> (1:50; 9101), pMEK1/2<sup>S217/S221</sup> (1:50; 9121), β-catenin (1:50; 9562), cofilin (1:50; 5175), and vinculin (1:30; 4650; Cell Signaling Technology). c-Myc (1:50; ab32072) was purchased from Abcam.

A standard assay buffer containing 0.1 Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 15 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl, 140 mM KCl, and 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was used. For all assays, the reaction mixtures without start reagents were prewarmed at 37°C. Composition of the reaction mixtures were as follows: hexokinase (enzyme commission [EC] 2.7.1.1) – 10.5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM NADP<sup>+</sup>, 10 mM glucose, 1.75 U/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 10 mM ATP (the production of NADPH was monitored over time by measuring absorbance at 340 nm); phosphofructokinase 1 (EC 2.7.1.11) – 1.5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), 1 mM ATP, 0.5 U/ml aldolase, 0.3 U/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.9 U/ml triosephosphate isomerase, and 2 mM fructose 6-phosphate (the consumption of NADH was monitored over time by measuring absorbance at 340 nm); aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) – 0.5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM NADH, 0.3 U/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.9 U/ml triosephosphate isomerase, and 2 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (the consumption of NADH was monitored over time by measuring absorbance at 340 nm); GAPDH (EC 1.2.1.12) – 1 mM DTT, 1.5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM ATP, 1.5 mM NADH, 22.5 U/ml 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and 5 mM 3-phosphoglyceric acid (the consumption of NADH was monitored over time by measuring absorbance at 340 nm); pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) – 1.5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM ADP, 1 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 1.5 mM NADH, 50 U/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (the consumption of NADH was monitored over time by measuring absorbance at 340 nm); and lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) – 0.5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM NADH, and 1 mM pyruvate (the consumption of NADH was monitored over time by measuring absorbance at 340 nm. Four different dilutions in PBS supplemented with the cocktails were analyzed to check for linearity.</p><p>Mitochondrial metabolic activity was measured using the RealTime Glo MT Cell Viability Assay (G9711; Promega). In short, organoids were passaged the day before the assay into a black-walled 96-well plate (3603; Corning). The next day, organoids were overlaid with 100 µl medium containing 0.1 µl NanoLuc enzyme, 0.1 µl MT Cell Viability Substrate, and 0.1 µl CellTox Green dye (G8741; Promega). Measurements of substrate conversion were performed using a Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek) set to 37°C. Luminescence was measured for 1 s, and fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were 485/20 and 528/20 nm, respectively. Measurements were done every hour, and mean values of three readouts were calculated. For normalization by DNA content, 5 µl of lysis solution (component of CellTox Green Cytotoxicity Assay; G8741; Promega) were added to each well. The plate was measured after 1 h of incubation at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and visual inspection was used for complete lysis.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>RNA analysis</title><p>For RNA sequencing, organoids were induced for 24 h with 2 µg/ml doxycycline in CCM-REN medium.

In brief, mRNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using an oligo-dT-T7 promoter primer, and labeled with Cyanine 3-CTP or Cyanine 5-CTP. After precipitation, purification, and quantification, 1 μg (4 × 44 K arrays) or 300 ng (8 × 60 K arrays) of each labeled cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to whole genome multipack microarrays according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent Technologies). Scanning of microarrays was performed with 5 μm resolution and XDR extended range (4 × 44 K arrays) or 3 µm resolution (8 × 60 K arrays) using a G2565CA high-resolution laser microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies). Microarray image data were analyzed and extracted with the Image Analysis/Feature Extraction software G2567AA v. A.11.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies) using default settings and the protocol GE2_1100_Jul11. The extracted MAGE-ML files were subsequently analyzed with the Rosetta Resolver, Build 7.2.2 SP1.31 (Rosetta Biosoftware). Ratio profiles comprising single hybridizations were combined in an error-weighted fashion to create ratio experiments. A 1.5-fold change expression cut-off for ratio experiments was applied together with anti-correlation of ratio profiles, rendering the microarray analysis highly significant, robust, and reproducible. Additionally, raw data txt files were analyzed with R packages from the Bioconductor repository. The networks and functional analyses of microarray data were generated via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN Inc., [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis">https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis</ext-link>])<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

30363662	        <p>Colorectal carcinoma is one of the common cancers in human. It has been intensely debated whether the<italic> in vitro</italic> cancer cell lines are closely enough for recapitulating the original tumor in understanding the molecular characteristic of CRC. Organoid as a new<italic> in vitro</italic> 3D culture system has sprang out in CRC study for the capability in reviving the original tissue. The aim of this study is to profile the gene expression of CRC organoid. The gene expression GSE64392 was from GEO database contained 20-patients-derived 37 organoid samples, including 22 colorectal tumor organoid samples and 15 paired healthy samples. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were applied for classifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Protein interaction among DEGs was analyzed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) and Cytoscape software. In total, 853 gene sequences were identified. GO analysis revealed that DEGs were extensively involved in various biological process (BP), like proliferation, cell cycle, and biosynthesis. KEEG pathway analysis showed that WNT, MAPK, TGF-<italic>β</italic>, SHH, ECM-receptor interaction, and FGF pathways were altered. DEGs which were identified with protein interactions were major response for extracellular matrix organization and the GPCR pathway. In conclusion, our study profiled the DEGs in CRC organoids and promotes our understanding of the CRC organoids as a new model for colorectal cancer research.</p>

30363662	      <p>Colorectal cancer development is a complex process of accumulation of genetic mutations, epigenetic alteration, and dysregulation of signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Despite numerous progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanism of the development of CRC, the underlying mechanism remains vagueness. Cancer cell lines have been applied as the main workforce for cancer research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, like other tumors, CRC exhibits a high genomic instability which contributes to the various phenotypes and pathologies of CRCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cancer cell lines limit in the capability of resembling the characteristics of the primary tumor tissue. Studies have reported the difference in gene expression and genomic alteration between cell line and tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Resulting from the identification of Lgr5+ stem cell in intestine and colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], a new 3D in vitro system, organoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], has made great impact on the colorectal research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As organoids resemble the characteristics of primary tissue, organoids have been widely applied for studying organ development, tissue homeostasis, tumorigenesis, and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As a promising<italic> ex vivo </italic>3D culture system for studying CRC, profiling genes expression level of CRC organoids is important for understanding the development of CRC. In the present study, we analyzed the data from GSE64392 and identified 100 upregulated genes and 305 downregulated genes in tumor organoids. DEGs were identified to involve in main capabilities of cancer, including cell renew, metastasis, angiogenesis, and cell death escaping. By analyzing the protein interaction of DEGs, we classified genes that may provide new insight for understanding the development of CRC.</p>
32714922	        <p>Directly after crypt isolation, organoid cultures were separated into three batches per animal and grown independently for 17 passages. Jejunum organoids were grown for 3 and 12 weeks (4–17 passages) and extracted using ice-cold PBS. After washing twice in PBS, intact organoids were pelleted at 300 × g for 5 min and suspended in RLT lysis buffer and stored at −80°C prior to RNA isolation. Porcine jejunum epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 (ACC-701) was grown in DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco) in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks. Data for one IPEC-J2 (p67) transcriptome was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Crooijmans, via the Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes (FAANG, BioSamples accession <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" ns0:href="SAMEA4447551">SAMEA4447551</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Giuffra et al., 2018</xref>). For the analysis of the remaining two lines, IPEC-J2 at passage 87 and 91 were seeded at 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 24-well plates and grown to confluence within 48 h with reduced P/S (1%). The monolayers were subsequently left to differentiate for 5 days, lysed using RLT-buffer, and stored at −80°C prior to RNA isolation. For RNA extraction of tissue, 0.5 mg of whole jejunum cross section per animal was added to a gentleMACS M tube (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) and dissociated in 2 ml RLT lysis buffer using a gentleMACS Dissociator for 30 s. Subsequently, 100 μl of homogenized tissue suspension was added to 500 μl fresh RLT buffer, homogenized using pipetting with a p200 pipette, and stored at −80°C until extraction. Total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions including a 15 min on-column DNAse step. Preliminary tRNA concentrations, contamination and degradation were identified using Qubit (Thermo-Fisher) and gel-electrophoresis. The quantity and integrity of RNA was measured using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).</p>

31306552	        <p>Transcriptomic profiles of untreated normal and tumor organoids showed a high number of differentially expressed genes, which mostly coincide with those previously reported (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="febs14998-fig-0005">5</xref>B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64392">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE64392</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="ref" rid="febs14998-bib-0014">14</xref>. Paired analysis of data from normal and tumor organoids of each patient followed by joint analysis of all patients’ data revealed that calcitriol significantly changed the expression of 2,107 genes (943 upregulated, 1,164 downregulated) in normal organoids and 1,182 genes (643 upregulated, 539 downregulated) in tumor organoids, which were partially coincident (532, 19.3%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="febs14998-fig-0005">5</xref>C,D and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="febs14998-sup-0001">S2</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100785">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100785</ext-link>). A strong correlation was found between genes induced by calcitriol in normal and tumor organoids, whereas the correlation was much weaker for repressed genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="febs14998-fig-0005">5</xref>E).

Notably, some clusters of genes showed different quantitative or even inverse regulation by calcitriol in normal and tumor organoids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="febs14998-fig-0005">5</xref>G, left). The expression level of these genes in untreated normal and tumor organoids is shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="febs14998-fig-0005">5</xref>G, right). Calcitriol targets also included genes involved in a variety of metabolic, detoxification, nuclear receptor‐related, and other pathways (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="febs14998-sup-0001">S3</xref>).

32792685	        <p id="Par11">Following the analysis of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> (and p53<sup>R172H</sup>)-induced changes in SI and COL organoids, we assessed the impact and functional relationship of the two oncogenic mutations in both organoid types by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The principle component analysis (PCA) shows that the gene expression profiles of SI and COL organoids significantly differ in their oncogene naive ground state (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>). As expected from their phenotypes, organoids expressing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, either singly or in combination with p53<sup>R172H</sup>, exhibited strong changes in their transcriptomes, while mutant p53 alone had only little impact on gene expression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) confirmed that p53<sup>R172H</sup>-mutant organoids displayed altered expression of p53 pathway genes, indicating successful loss of p53 wild-type function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Oncogene induction in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>/p53<sup>R172H</sup> organoids induced a strong p53 signature; however, diminished p53 target gene activation could still be detected within the double-mutant organoids. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref> compares the relative fold changes of selected transcripts upon induction of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, alone or in combination with p53<sup>R172H</sup>, in SI and COL organoids. In both organoid types, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induced transcripts associated with metabolic rewiring (e.g., the glycolytic key enzymes HK1/2) as well as an immediate early gene response as reflected by the FOS family transcription factors (<italic>Fosl1</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>) and negative feedback regulators of the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, such as <italic>Dusp4/5/6</italic>, <italic>Spry4</italic>, and <italic>Errfi1</italic>. Of note, these and other transcripts were shown to be reversely affected by BRAF inhibitors in human CRC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and their cross-validation in clinical CRC samples and prognostic relevance is presented in a literature survey in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>. Many transcripts positively associated with invasion and metastasis were upregulated in both organoid types. Interestingly, several of them displayed a more pronounced fold change in COL than in SI organoids, or were exclusively altered in COL organoids. Examples for this category are <italic>Myof</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and <italic>Fgf15</italic>, whose human orthologue FGF19 has been linked to CRC aggressiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>).

32792685	        <p id="Par16">The marked differences between SI and COL organoids in response to oncoprotein expression prompted us to compare the transcriptomes of primary intestinal crypts. As shown by the PCA in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, SI and COL crypts significantly differed in their transcriptomic ground state. Importantly, crypts from both tissues displayed unanticipated differences in the expression of ERK-pathway elements and target genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b–e</xref>). For example, KSR1, a potent RAF activator and scaffolding protein for the three core kinases of the RAF/MEK/ERK module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], was more highly expressed at the RNA and protein level in SI organoids. Commensurate with previous studies in other cell types (see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and references therein), we demonstrate a positive correlation between KSR1 expression and MEK/ERK phosphorylation for intestinal tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d, e</xref>). Of note, KSR1 expression, MEK/ERK phosphorylation, and expression of the ERK target gene DUSP6 were highest in proximal SI, the tissue usually used for organoid generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). In contrast, but as expected from previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], Cdx2 expression increased along the anterior–posterior axis. Interestingly, Spred and Sprouty (Spry), which suppress the ERK pathway at its apex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], were also more abundantly expressed in COL crypts. These observations indicate that the ERK axis is more stringently controlled in the COL, and that higher pathway activity is tolerated in the SI.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Primary small and large intestine exhibit differences in basal ERK-signaling activity (GSE132546).</title><p><bold>a</bold> PCA of RNA-Seq of freshly isolated small intestinal (SI, circles) and colonic (COL, triangles) crypts from two female (no. 1, 4) and two male (no. 2, 3) donor mice.

32792685	        <p id="Par17">Interestingly, our RNA-Seq analysis revealed that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> triggers processes linked to both ends of the functional crypt–villus axis. On the one hand, we confirm ISC niche exhaustion by the loss of Paneth cells in SI organoids (Supplementary Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2f</xref>) and the decrease of transcripts associated with intestinal stemness and Lgr5/Wnt signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>). On the other hand, induction of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> also markedly reduced intestinal differentiation markers, in particular in COL organoids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>). This is further supported by Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>, demonstrating a strong enrichment of the intestine data sets from <italic>Cdx1/Cdx2</italic> double-knockout mice (GSE24633) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] in our COL organoid transcriptomes.

Labeled RNA were hybridized onto 3D‐Gene Mouse miRNA Oligo chips (Toray, Kamakura, Japan). The annotation and oligonucleotide sequences of the probes conformed to the miRBase Release 19 database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.mirbase.org">www.mirbase.org</ext-link>). After stringent washes, the fluorescent signals were scanned with a 3D‐Gene Scanner (Toray Industries) and analyzed using the 3D‐Gene Extraction software (Toray Industries). The raw data for each spot was normalized by subtraction with the mean intensity of the background signal determined from the signal intensities of all blank spots with 95% confidence intervals. Measurements for spots with signal intensities greater than two standard deviations (SD) of the background signal intensity were considered to be valid. The relative expression level of a given miRNA was calculated by comparing the signal intensities of the valid spots throughout the microarray experiments. The normalized data were globally normalized per array, so that the median of the signal intensity was adjusted to 25.

Organoid cultures were dissociated, and 50,000 single cells were lysed and nuclei collected at 500 g for 10 minutes in lysis buffer containing 0.1% NP-40. Pelleted nuclei were tagmented with Nextera Tn5 Transposase (TDE1, Illumina FC-121-1030) for 20 minutes at 22 °C and 30 minutes at 37 °C. Transposed DNA was purified using Qiagen MinElute kit (28204) and fragments PCR amplified as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref024">24</xref>]. ATAC libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq using a 150H kit with 75 bp paired-end reads, and total reads were collated from 2 runs to obtain approximately 60 × 10<sup>6</sup> reads per sample. Sequencing runs were pooled for each replicate and sample, and adapters were trimmed with Trim Galore!

Mitochondrial and duplicate reads were removed using Picard-Tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>), and bam files were run through macs2 (doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137">10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137</ext-link>) for peak calling using these parameters: “—nomodel—shift—75—extsize 150—qvalue 0.05.” For DA analysis, bam files were loaded in SeqMonk (v1.37.1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/</ext-link>), and probes were created using a tiling approach with 150 bp windows end to end across the genome.

Two biological replicates were prepared of the basal-derived organoids and 3 biological replicates of luminal-derived. RNA-seq was carried out on an Illumina Nextseq 500 to produce 20–65 million 80 bp reads per sample. Read pairs were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using the subread aligner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref044">44</xref>] implemented in the Rsubread software package. Read counts for Entrez Genes were obtained using featureCounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref045">45</xref>] and its inbuilt mm10 annotation. Gene information was downloaded from the NCBI on 1 February 2017.

Genes with at least 0.5 read counts per million (cpm) in at least 2 samples were considered to be expressed and were kept in the analysis. Immunoglobulin receptor segments, ribosomal genes, predicted and pseudogenes, and obsolete Entrez IDs were filtered out. Trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) scale normalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref047">47</xref>] was applied, and read counts were transformed to log2-cpm with a prior count of 3. Linear models were used to test for expression differences between 4OHT treated versus untreated samples from luminal cells and from basal cells. Each organoid sample was treated as a random block, allowing for correlation between repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref048">48</xref>]. Differential expression was assessed using the Treat method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref049">49</xref>], computing empirical Bayes moderated <italic>t</italic> statistics relative to a fold change threshold of 1.5, and allowing for an abundance trend in the standard errors and for robust estimation of the Bayesian hyperparameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004986.ref050">50</xref>]. The Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to control the FDR. These data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession code GSE116431).</p>

We further confirmed these results by qRT–PCR of several of these genes in a different set of tumouroids from both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). By Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) we identified several pathways that were miss-regulated in the IKK<italic>α</italic>-deficient adenoma cells compared with the WT. This applies to the apoptosis pathway that was significantly enriched in the absence of IKK<italic>α</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D and F</xref>), involving genes such as <italic>RIPK1</italic>, <italic>TRADD</italic>, <italic>FASLG</italic>, <italic>FAS</italic> and <italic>CASP8</italic> among others. In contrast, IKK<italic>α</italic>-deficient adenomas showed a decrease in cell cycle-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). IKK<italic>α</italic> deficiency also led to a decrease in the pro-tumourigenic MYC signature, whereas it did not correlate with a general reduction in the canonical NF-<italic>κ</italic>B signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E and F</xref>), further suggesting that IKK<italic>α</italic> function in the intestinal adenoma stem cells is mainly NF-<italic>κ</italic>B independent.

31814692	        <p>Open-ended dynamic time warping (OE-DTW) analysis was used to compare the maturation state of the different retina organoid time-course stage expression data to the human fetal retina (GSE104827) and the human adult retina, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. Retina organoid time-course stages were defined as Stage 1: 25–36 days, Stage 2: 50–75 days, Stage 3: 80–90 days, Stage 4: 105–125 days, Stage 5: 145–172 days, and Stage 6: 186–205. Mean gene expression values at each stage were used for OE-DTW analysis. The gene set used for the OE-DTW analysis consisted of 118 well-known retina-centric transcription factors and cell-type markers (see Appendix 3 and Appendix 4). Co-inertia analysis was performed using MADE4 v1.52.0 package in R.</p>

32963006	        <p><bold>(i) Organoids.</bold> Microarray experiments were performed as independent dual-color dye-reversal color-swap hybridizations using two biological replicates each. Total RNA was amplified and labeled with a dual-color Quick-Amp labeling kit (Agilent Technologies). In brief, mRNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using an oligo-dT-T7 promoter primer and labeled with cyanine 3-CTP or cyanine 5-CTP. After precipitation, purification, and quantification, 0.75 μg of each labeled cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to custom whole-genome human multipack microarrays (8 × 60k; Agilent, 048908) according to the supplier’s protocol (Agilent Technologies). Scanning of microarrays was performed at 3-μm resolution using a G2565CA high-resolution laser microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies). Microarray image data were processed with Image Analysis/Feature Extraction software G2567AA vA.11.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies) using default settings and the GE2_1105_Oct12 extraction protocol. The extracted dual-color raw data .txt files were further analyzed using R and the associated BioConductor package limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>).

In brief, extracted total RNA was checked with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and labeled with Cy5 and Cy3. The labeled RNAs were hybridized onto a Human Oligo chip 25k (Toray Industries). After stringent washing, the fluorescent signals were scanned with a 3D-Gene Scanner (Toray Industries) and analyzed using the 3D-Gene Extraction software (Toray Industries). The raw data for each spot were normalized by subtraction of the mean background signal intensity determined from the signal intensities of all blank spots with 95% confidence intervals. The relative expression level was calculated by comparing the signal intensities of the valid spots throughout the microarray experiments. All data were submitted to the GEO database under the accession number GSE93908.</p>

Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was searched as a fixed modification, whereas <italic>N</italic>-acetyl protein and oxidation of methionine were searched as variable modifications. Identification was set to a false discovery rate of 1%. To achieve reliable identifications, all proteins were accepted based on the criteria that the number of forward hits in the database was at least 100-fold higher than the number of reverse database hits, thus resulting in a false discovery rate of less than 1%. A minimum of 3 peptides were quantified for each protein, and quantification performed only in the presence of 3 ratio counts.

27803115	        <p>For microarray analysis, paired first-passage EpOC and d-EpOC generated from colonic samples of 11 non-IBD controls and 8 patients with UC were used (Patient Group 1, see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S1A</xref>). The derived cRNA was hybridised to high-density oligonucleotide Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U219 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, USA). Raw data were analysed using Bioconductor tools in R (V.3.1.0). Microarray raw data (CEL files) and processed data have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession no GSE75916 (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=ehejqkoobraxxip&amp;acc=GSE75916">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=ehejqkoobraxxip&amp;acc=GSE75916</ext-link>).</p>
27803115	        <p>Next, we asked how the deregulated genes found in the organoid cultures of patients with UC were modulated during inactive and active phases of the disease. To answer this, we aligned the EpOC and d-EpOC expression profile with our previously published transcriptional signature from biopsies of non-IBD controls and patients with UC (series accession number GSE38713).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Approximately, 66% (72/109) of genes significantly upregulated or downregulated in EpOCs and/or d-EpOCs from patients with UC were found to be similarly deregulated in whole biopsies from patients with UC (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary table S2</xref>). Interestingly, expression of the EpOC-associated transcriptional signature in non-involved segments from patients with UC was comparable with that of non-IBD controls (data not shown). To further validate these results, we performed qPCR expression analysis of a selected panel of genes in colonic biopsies from non-IBD controls and patients with UC in endoscopic remission or with active disease (Patient Group 2, see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S1A</xref>). <italic>LYZ</italic>, <italic>CLDN18</italic> and <italic>HYAL1</italic> transcripts analysed in the mucosa of patients with active UC followed a pattern of upregulation similar to that observed in UC-derived organoid cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2016312609F3">figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2016312609F5">5</xref>A). Changes in the protein expression were analysed by immunohistochemical staining in colonic sections (Patient Group 3, see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S1A</xref>). Lysozyme C was barely detected in epithelial cells in control non-IBD sigmoid mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2016312609F5">figure 5</xref>B). However, it markedly accumulated in the granules of secretory epithelial cells along the crypts in samples of active UC (and in metaplastic Paneth cell clusters not observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2016312609F5">figure 5</xref>B). Additional cell sources of lysozyme, probably macrophages and activated dendritic cells,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
27803115	        <p>Thus far, our data suggest the presence of sustained changes in UC-derived EpOCs. We therefore wondered whether the global gene expression signature of organoid cultures derived from patients with UC resembled the profile of other regions of the GI tract. To this end, we aligned the expression signature of EpOCs and d-EpOCs from patients with UC to the previously published gene expression map of the healthy human GI tract (series accession number GSE10867).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Interestingly, genes perturbed in EpOCs and/or d-EpOCs from patients with UC compared with controls (n=100 genes) were able to segregate the GI samples according to their location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2016312609F7">figure 7</xref>), revealing a considerable number of genes associated with different GI regions (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary table S2</xref>). Genes overexpressed in EpOCs and/or d-EpOCs from patients with UC (left column, in purple) correlated with a gene subset highly expressed mainly in healthy antrum, jejunum and duodenum. Among them, the identified genes <italic>LYZ</italic>, <italic>CLDN18</italic>, <italic>HYAL1</italic> and <italic>ANXA10</italic> could be observed. Similarly, genes downregulated in EpOCs and/or d-EpOCs from patients with UC (left column, in orange) were transcripts predominantly expressed in healthy colon (ie, <italic>AQP8</italic>, <italic>ZG16</italic> and <italic>CLCA1</italic>). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that both lysozyme C and claudin-18 were abundantly expressed by healthy gastric epithelium (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">supplementary figure S5</xref>). As expected, lysozyme C also showed selective expression by Paneth cells in healthy small intestinal mucosa (similarly to GIIC sPLA2). In contrast, protein expression of hZG16, hCLCA1 and GIIC sPLA2 was undetectable in healthy gastric epithelium. No significant deregulation of hyal-1 expression was evident in healthy gastric epithelium compared with control or UC-affected sigmoid colon.</p>

29143738	        <p>Having established that RXRA<sup>S427F</sup> phenocopies GW0742 induced growth in the organoid growth assay, we next looked for transcriptional evidence that RXRA<sup>S427F</sup> was activating PPARD. Organoids were cultured in standard media for seven days and then treated with PPAR antagonists for an additional two days. We then determined mRNA expression levels of two PPAR target genes by RT-qPCR. Comparing vehicle-treated samples, <italic>Plin2</italic> and <italic>Fabp4</italic> were found significantly up-regulated in the mutant condition compared to the empty vector or wild-type organoids, confirming that mutant RXRA up-regulates expected PPAR targets in the organoid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Treatment of the mutant expressing organoids with either of two PPARD inverse agonists, ST247 and GSK0660, blunted up-regulation of the target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Naruhn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shearer et al., 2008</xref>).

We identified 20 transcription factors in the Lgr5<sup>low</sup>Ki67<sup>−</sup> population (<italic>Foxj2, Runx1, Prox1, Foxa3, Mxd4, Hmx2, Pou2f3, SpiB, Pax6, Nkx2-2, St18, Pax4, Neurod1, Isl1, Runx1t1, Creb3 l4, Fev, Spdef, Neurog3,</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic>) including <italic>Atoh1</italic>, a master regulator of secretory differentiation (Yang <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2001</xref>; van Es <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2005</xref>; Shroyer <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2007</xref>). Several factors implicated in secretory differentiation were in this group. <italic>Pax4, NeuroD1, Nkx2-2</italic>, and <italic>Isl1</italic> are inducers of endocrine differentiation, while <italic>Spdef</italic> is required for both the Paneth and goblet cell differentiation (Naya <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1997</xref>; Larsson <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">1998</xref>; Jenny <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2002</xref>; Desai <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2008</xref>; Gregorieff <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2009</xref>). <italic>SpiB</italic> is an important player in differentiation of M cells, which are derived from Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells, but are rare in the intact intestine (Kanaya <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2012</xref>; de Lau <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2012</xref>). As Lgr5<sup>low</sup>Ki67<sup>−</sup> cells express significantly higher levels of ChgA (7.0-fold more than Lgr5<sup>low</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> and 6.2-fold more than Lgr5<sup>high</sup>Ki67<sup>−</sup>, Supplementary Fig S2) and likely represent the +4/5 cells, we analyzed the expression of reported quiescent stem cell markers. Tert, Hopx, and Bmi1 were not significantly higher in any of the populations while Lrig1 was expressed slightly higher in Lgr5<sup>high</sup> cells excluding them as specific markers of a slow-dividing CBC population (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>B) (Montgomery <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2011</xref>; Yan <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">2012</xref>; Wong <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">2012</xref>). This confirms several recent reports on the shared expression of these markers between slow-cycling “+4” cells and Lgr5 CBC cells (Itzkovitz <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2012</xref>; Munoz <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2012</xref>; Powell <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2012</xref>; Wong <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">2012</xref>; Wang <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">2013</xref>).</p>
25092767	        <p>Lgr5 subpopulations also displayed a distinct profile of signaling pathway components. Inhibition of Notch signaling results in an upregulation of Atoh1 expression and induces secretory differentiation. Consistently, <italic>Notch1</italic> mRNA was high in stem cells and was virtually absent in Lgr5<sup>low</sup>Ki67<sup>−</sup> cells. Another Lgr5<sup>low</sup>Ki67<sup>−</sup>-enriched gene, <italic>St18</italic>, is a tumor suppressor that during pancreatic development inhibits Notch signaling (Wang <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">2007</xref>). The notion of secretory differentiation in Lgr5<sup>low</sup>Ki67<sup>−</sup> cells is supported by other factors highly enriched in this population. Enteroendocrine markers ChgA and ChgB, as well as hormones expressed by enteroendocrine subtypes (Stt, Gcg) and some of their regulators (Rfx6), are the most prominent factors (Supplementary Fig S2A). Confocal and qPCR analysis confirmed that some of the Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells express ChgA (Supplementary Fig S2B–D) as well as somatostatin (Stt) (Supplementary Fig S2D). Similarly, <italic>Kit</italic> and <italic>Muc2</italic>, Paneth and goblet cell factors, respectively, are also among the enriched genes (Supplementary Fig S2A). Taken together, the results imply that the Lgr5<sup>low</sup>Ki67<sup>−</sup> cells are in the secretory lineage.</p>

25448065	      <p>To test the ability of putative SG stem cells to differentiate into mature cell lineages, single-cell-derived spheres were plated into a 3D matrix mixture of collagen and Matrigel, supplemented with minimal medium with 10% fetal calf serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A, Differentiation). Within 1–3 weeks, the seeded spheres changed morphologically into diverse organoid-like structures. Two types of organoids, ductal and lobular, could be discerned. Ductal organoids contained a lumen (arrows) and were surrounded by cells that stained positive for CK7 and CK18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>D), which is consistently expressed in SG duct cells. The lobular organoids were devoid of tubular extensions but rather contained compact, round, lobule-like structures, which expressed the acinar cell protein aquaporin-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>E, AQP5). To confirm genome-wide signs of differentiation in the organoids, a gene expression analysis was performed (details in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4">Experimental Procedures</xref>; Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0010" ns0:href="ncbi-geo:GSE59559">GSE59559</ext-link>). Data from organoids were compared to that of primary spheres (representing a relatively undifferentiated state) using differential gene expression analysis. Results identified 302 differentially expressed probes in organoids when compared to primary spheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>A) with a stringent threshold (p &lt; 0.0001). Among these, 102 probes were upregulated (&gt;logFc2.0) in organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>B) compared to primary spheres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref> available online).

However, expression of <italic>GATA3</italic> mRNA was detected in all conditions (data not shown). As expected by the non-contractile function of luminal cells, attachment of the gels did not have any detectable effect on the morphology, as well as on the expression of <italic>ELF5</italic> and <italic>TJP1</italic>/ZO-1 in LP-derived spheres (<uri ns0:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.123554/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S4B,C</uri>).

Once branched structures had formed, gels were detached and simultaneously treated with either the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C33">Prater et al., 2014</xref>) or the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to prevent cellular contraction (<uri ns0:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.123554/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S4D,E</uri>).

However, we observed the generation of alveoli-like buds and differentiation towards the luminal lineage only in floating/compliant, but not in attached/rigid, collagen gels. Consistently, previous studies demonstrated that matrix rigidity regulates growth and morphogenesis of breast epithelial cells in 3D-culture models. Specifically, high stiffness due to collagen concentration, crosslinking, matrix attachment or interpenetrating polymer networks has been shown to disrupt normal morphogenesis, leading to multicellular structures with a malignant/invasive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C11">Chaudhuri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C22">Levental et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C32">Paszek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C35">Provenzano and Keely, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C57">Wozniak et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, we observed persistent elongation and increased formation of side branches by primary HMECs in rigid collagen gels, a process that inherently requires invasiveness and was related to a basal epithelial program in invasive breast cancer, also using collagen gels as an experimental tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C12">Cheung et al., 2013</xref>). While high matrix stiffness is observed in breast tumors and has been linked to tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C22">Levental et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C32">Paszek et al., 2005</xref>), our results suggest that responsiveness to the physical environment is a conserved feature in normal MG development. Notably, it has been suggested that tensional homeostasis of both exogenous and endogenous forces, mediated via the cytoskeleton, is crucial for normal tissue behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C31">Paszek and Weaver, 2010</xref>). Such endogenous forces may be particularly important, as MaSCs display contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C33">Prater et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although flotation of the gels was required for alveologenesis at the tips of branched structures, addition of forskolin, which raises intracellular cAMP levels, increased the generation of alveoli in floating gels. As cAMP accelerates the distribution of integrin α6 to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C28">Nedvetsky et al., 2012</xref>), forskolin probably enhanced cell adhesion to laminins. Importantly, we observed laminin staining only in structures grown in floating, but not attached, collagen gels. Together, these results suggest that the effects of both flotation and forskolin impinge on anchoring epithelial cells to the basement membrane as a prerequisite to establish basal polarity, thereby promoting alveologenesis.</p><p>Primary cells most accurately reflect cell behavior <italic>in vivo</italic>, and supposedly differences between donors, including age, parity, hormonal status and genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, heterogeneity in TDLU-like structure-forming potential among donor tissues was expected and suggests that individual differences are conserved in culture. For our limited number of tissues, TDLU-like structure formation did not correlate with age or parity of the donors, suggesting that cells with regenerative potential are maintained even after menopause and exist before pregnancy.</p><p>Importantly, the use of the metallo-endopeptidase CD10 as a cell-surface marker revealed the presence of a CD10-negative stromal component within the CD49f<sup>hi</sup>/EpCAM<sup>−</sup> population, previously labeled basal. Gene expression profiling suggested that this stromal component may contain a variety of CD31<sup>−</sup> and CD45<sup>−</sup> endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Given the relevance of interactions between HMECs and lymphendothelium during branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C7">Betterman et al., 2012</xref>) and breast cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C1">Alitalo and Detmar, 2012</xref>), future work will focus on the characterization of this distinct stromal component. For this purpose, the chemically and physically defined <italic>in vitro</italic> assay system we describe here will be particularly useful: stromal components can be added for co-culture studies and HMECs with distinct genetic backgrounds can be tested.</p><p>Luminal progenitor cells of two out of three donors gave rise to branched structures, suggesting that plasticity can occur in this compartment.

Importantly, rigorous quantification of normal or malignant regenerative capacity at the single-cell level is enabled by ELDA. Finally, for future studies, it will be important to test whether our assay can be adapted to support cells of other organs undergoing branching morphogenesis, such as lung, kidney or pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV123554C24">Lu et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Isolation and culture of human mammary epithelial cells</title><p>Mammary gland tissue was obtained from healthy women undergoing reduction mammoplasty at the Nymphenburg Clinic for Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery, in accordance with the regulations of the ethics committee of the Ludwig-Maximilian University, Munich, Germany (proposal 397-12).

27386949	        <p>Our mouse tumor data indicate that tumor PI is suppressed by sulindac treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Prolonged NSAID treatment was found to reduce both the incidence and the mortality of human cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To study the relevance of PI in NSAID treatment in humans, we first searched for public expression data of NSAID treatment in cancer cell lines. While there are several such databases, notably the Broad Institute Connectivity Map (C-Map) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], most of the data are limited to cell lines that show low PI levels before treatment and, therefore, no treatment effect is expected. Nevertheless, we observed one particular cell line with a high PI score, SCC-25, an oral cancer cell line treated with 2 mM of aspirin (GSE58162). This cell line has a high PI score, which ranks it 19th out of 634 CCLE carcinomas. We observed a sharp decrease in the expression of the PI genes in response to the treatment, and in two of the three replicates the PI gene set is significantly downregulated compared with all genes: U-test <italic>p</italic> value = 8.6e-4, 0.318, and 0.009 in the three replicates, respectively. Similarly, we found that the PI score decreased in all three replicates following aspirin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>). We further noticed that the response to aspirin is significantly enhanced when examining a large set of genes that are upregulated in correlation with the PI score; 74.0 % of the top 215 correlated genes are downregulated in response to aspirin treatment (U-test <italic>p</italic> value = 8.1e-25; Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S8).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Parainflammation decreases in response to NSAID treatment in human cell lines. <bold>a</bold> average of the differential expression (in log2 scale) of three replicates each of control and aspirin-treated SCC-25 cells for the PI genes.

30236451	      <p id="p0040">Biliary Atresia (BA) (see below) is a cholangiopathy that mostly affects the extrahepatic biliary tree. The transcription factors Pdx1, Hes1 and Sox17 are important for development of the extrahepatic biliary tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0010">2</xref>] and Sox17 expression is downregulated in experimental models for BA. It has long been established that cholangiocytes are a heterogeneous cell population, and can, for example, be subdivided into large and small cholangiocytes, which differ in terms of expression of certain markers such as the secretin receptor and CFTR (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0050">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0055">11</xref>]). The extent of cholangiocyte heterogeneity is however not well understood. Recent studies provide evidence for at least two major cholangiocyte populations but how they relate to morphologically distinguishable cholangiocyte subtypes is not clear. Cholangiocytes immunoreactive for MIC1-IC3 and expressing high levels of ST14 (suppression of tumorigenicity 14), are far more clonogenic than ST14-low cells, but express similar leves of <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Epcam</italic>, <italic>Krt19</italic> and <italic>Hnf1β</italic>.

Importantly, the MIC1-IC3 monoclonal antibody, from Novus Biologicals, is raised against nonparenchymal cells from DDC-treated mice, and is suggested to react with oval cells/hepatic proliferating duct cells, which means these experiments enrich for cells present or arising in ductular regenerative processes. The organization of possible subclasses of cholangiocytes along the biliary tree still needs to be established, and it will be interesting to learn whether there are for example hilar–peripheral zonation principles similar to the recently established portal-central zonation of hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0070">14</xref>].</p>

31142540	        <p>scRNA-seq sample preparation was performed using an adapted version of Smartseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C36">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>). cDNA was reverse transcribed using 50 U reaction SmartScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Takara ClonTech) without betaine and MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and amplified using KAPA HiFi Hotstart polymerase (Roche). Illumina Nextera XT DNA preparation kit was used to prepare libraries, and pooled libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system (single-end 50 bp reads). The quality of the reads was examined with FastQC (<uri ns1:href="www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</uri>). The reads were aligned to genome version GRCm38, with the 92 Spike-in transcript sequences added, using STAR (v2.6.0c) and Ensemble gene annotation version 93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C21">Kersey et al., 2018</xref>). Subread (v1.6.2) was used to count uniquely aligned reads using the same Ensemble annotation and to create the count matrix. Further analysis was performed using scanpy (v1.3.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C53">Wolf et al., 2018b</xref>). For quality control of cells, the following quality metrics were calculated for each cell: (1) the percentage mitochondrial transcript reads, (2) the percentage of spike-in reads, (3) the total number of reads, and (4) the log10 transformed number of genes with at least one read. Only cells with (1) less than 20% of mitochondrial reads, (2) less than 25% spike-in reads and (3) more than 100,000 reads were considered for downstream analysis. As the log10 transformed number of genes with at least one read (4) showed clear batch effects, the four different thresholds 3.6, 3.5, 3.7 and 3.5 were applied to the four different sorts and only cells exceeding these thresholds passed quality control. In total, 653 (69%) of 943 cells were considered for downstream analysis. Because an initial principal component analysis revealed batch effects between the biological replicates from experiments 1, 2 and 4 (group 1) on the one hand and experiment 3 (group 2) on the other hand, batch correction between those two groups was performed: for each group, only genes expressed in at least 3 cells were considered. The counts in each group were normalised using size factors computed with the scran (v1.8.4) function computeSumFactors [parameters: min_mean=1.0, size=seq(20, 100, 5)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C28">Lun et al., 2016</xref>). For each group, highly variable genes were detected using the scanpy function filter_genes_dispersion (parameter: max_mean=8) and the intersection of both gene sets, which contained 1766 genes, was used for further analysis. Batch effects between the two datasets were corrected by matching mutual nearest neighbours in the implementation of mnnpy (v0.1.9.3) (parameters: svd_mode=‘irlb’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C28">Lun et al., 2016</xref>). On the resulting count matrix, a principal component analysis was performed. t-SNE dimensionality reduction was performed on the first 20 principal components using the MulticoreTSNE implementation (parameters: perplexity=80, early_exageration=12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C1">Amir et al., 2013</xref>). To perform Louvain clustering, the 15 nearest-neighbours graph was computed on the first 20 principal components. Using Louvain clustering with the resolution parameter set to 0.05, three clusters were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C26">Levine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C45">Šubelj and Bajec, 2011</xref>). Differentially expressed genes were detected by performing a Wilcoxon rank-sum test on the raw counts comparing each cluster against the union of the other two clusters as implemented in scanpy's rank_genes_groups function. To define marker genes for the clusters at specific embryonic stages, the cells were grouped according to cluster and stage, and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed as described above. For the sub-clustering of the cholangiocyte-like cluster, a principal component analysis was performed on those cells and then clustering was performed as above with the resolution parameter set to 0.5. Differentially expressed genes between the two resulting sub-clusters were detected as described above. The diffusion maps were calculated using the scanpy function diffmap with the width of the Gaussian connectivity kernel being implicitly determined by the distance to the 100 nearest neighbours in the space of the 20 first principal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C11">Coifman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C16">Haghverdi et al., 2015</xref>). Diffusion pseudotime was calculated using scanpy's dpt function using the cell with minimal diffusion component 1 as root cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C17">Haghverdi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C52">Wolf et al., 2018a</xref>). Cell cycle phases were assigned using cyclone and the pre-trained mouse cycle markers contained in the scran package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV174557C41">Scialdone et al., 2015</xref>). Cells were classified as Lgr5 positive at the transcript level if they had more than 10 reads of Lgr5. The code is available on GitHub at github.com/fabianrost84/prior_et_al_2019.</p>

28489070	      <p>Senescent cells present a steady status, typically arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but metabolically and transcriptionally active, secreting a group of factors collectively termed the SASP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The composition and amounts of the SASP may vary according to the duration of senescence and mechanisms inducing senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In the present study, certain types of SASP, such as MMPs and chemokines, identified in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model also overlapped significantly with those of <italic>in vivo</italic> senescent tumour cells. These data suggested that SASP expressed at the invasive borders of PTC could at least in part originate from BRAFV600E-expressing senescent cells. Among the SASP, we focused on chemokines and observed that various chemokines were upregulated in <italic>in vitro</italic> senescent cells. We deeply considered several kinds of possible chemokines signalling in cancer invasion and metastasis using RNA-sequencing analysis. Although several chemokines were upregulated at the invasive border of PTC, the expression of their receptors were very low, except for the CXCL12 receptor. These chemokine expression patterns were also identified in <italic>in vitro</italic> model (RNA-sequencing data was deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE81144 and GSE83560). Finally, we found that the expression of <italic>CXCL12/CXCR4</italic> was significantly upregulated in both senescent cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in PTC tissues, therefore, we focused on CXCL12/CXCR4 signalling. CXCR4 activation stimulates the directed migration of cancer cells and increases their invasiveness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Migration and invasion of CXCR4-expressing tumour cells depend upon a gradient of the chemokine, CXCL12, the only known ligand for CXCR4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Interestingly, CXCL12 expression was not homogeneous across the tumour areas of PTC, but prominently increased in areas of collective invasion in PTC. Moreover, CXCL12-expressing cells were clearly correlated with senescent cells in areas of collective invasion. These data suggested that senescent cells in PTC can generate a chemotactic gradient at invasive borders through increased CXCL12 expression. Generation of a front-rear CXCL12 gradient can guide collective migration through the activation of CXCR4 signalling, and beyond guidance, chemotactic signalling can reinforce cell-cell adhesion and cell clustering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Here, we demonstrated that CXCR4-expressing PTC cells were able to follow CXCL12-expressing senescent thyrocytes, and that CXCL12-expressing senescent thyrocytes effectively attracted CXCR4-expressing cancer cells in the migration assay. In addition, 3D invasion assay showed that some senescent thyrocytes formed the route in collagen containing matrigel by expressing MMPs and subsequently led cancer cells. Interestingly, when we administered the CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) to the organoid culture, we observed marked decreases in senescent cells invasion ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16a</xref>). We also found that <italic>MMPs</italic> expression was markedly downregulated in AMD3100 treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16b</xref>), which was consistent with the results of previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Collectively, these data suggested that senescent cells work as a ‘storming party' in the collective invasion of cancer through SASP, including MMPs and CXCL12/CXCR4 signalling.</p>

29535731	        <p>RNA was submitted for whole transcriptome gene expression assessment using Illumina Hiseq (Virginia Bioinformatics Institute Core Lab Facilities). Fastq files containing 100 bp-long pair-end reads were assessed and poor quality reads (&gt;40% of bases with PHRED score &lt;10; percentage of N greater than 5%; and polyA reads) were filtered out. Remaining high quality reads were mapped to RefSeq (mm10 from <uri ns0:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/" ns0:type="simple">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</uri>) using Bowtie (version: 1.0.0) with parameters set to “-l 25-I 1-X 1000-a-m 200.” Gene expression levels were calculated using an expectation-maximum algorithm, RSEM. FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million sequenced reads) values were used as expression level measurements. The resultant dataset has been submitted to the NCBI GEO database (accession number GSE68419).</p>

33087697	        <p id="Par29">Patient-derived laparoscopic wedge biopsies, xenografts (PDX), or cell lines were lysed using Triton X-100 and cell lysates incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μg of pan-HLA-ABC specific mAb W6/32 for every 10 mg of protein. Protein A/G Ultralink resin beads were used to immunoprecipitate HLA class I molecules and HLA-bound peptides were then eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid. HLA-A,B,C isolation was confirmed by Western blot analysis, then HLA-positive elutes were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). HLA class I protein recovery was semi-quantitatively assessed by rating Western blot band intensity on a scale from 0 (not detectable) to 4 (highest intensity). Molecular weight filters were employed if tumor specimens were of sufficient size (&gt;250 mg), but sample losses precluded this technique with smaller specimens. Eluted peptides were analyzed by high-sensitivity LC-MS/MS using a Nano-Cap LC system (Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC-Nano) interfaced to a tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Fusion) using ESI. Chromatography was performed using 0.1% formic acid in water as A solvent, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as B solvent.

27811057	        <p>Having established that ELP3 promotes the expression of the DEK–LEF1 axis to support breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis, we further assessed the expression of these proteins in extracts from various breast cancer cell lines. Interestingly, we found that ELP3, DEK, and LEF1 protein levels correlated in breast cell lines, whereas no correlation was found with the transcription factor TCF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>; and not depicted). We then tested if such correlation could be highlighted in samples from human breast cancer patients. Samples were collected from different subtypes of human breast cancer (i.e., ER+, HER2+, and Triple-negative breast cancers), and protein levels of ELP3, DEK, and LEF1 were quantified. Remarkably, the expressions of ELP3, DEK, and LEF1 were significantly correlated in human breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C–E</xref>). Interestingly, this correlation was observed independently of the breast cancer subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 F</xref>), suggesting that the integrity of ELP3 is critical for the expression of the DEK–LEF1 axis as a general molecular pathway relevant in any human breast cancer. Finally, we searched in silico for breast cancer-related gene expression datasets with links to outcome.

Together, these data validate our molecular model and indicate that U34 tRNA modification supports the translational elongation of DEK and the subsequent IRES-dependent LEF1 translational initiation during metastasis.</p>

27811057	        <p>Tumor organoids were extracted from PyMT tumors of similar size, in three different mice for each experimental condition and use for the generation of unicellular suspension. The organoid pellets were then trypsinized in 2 ml Trypsin-EDTA 0.25% for 5 min, centrifuged, and resuspended in prewarmed Dispase (5 mg/ml) and 0.2 ml of DNase I (1 mg/ml; STEMCELL Technologies). The samples were then centrifuged and resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS 10% to form unicellular suspension. The EasySep Mouse Mammary Epithelial Cell Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) was used to select epithelial cells. Total RNAs from mammary epithelial tumor cells were extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA integrity was verified on the Bioanalyser 2100 with RNA 6000 Nano chips, and RIN scores were &gt;9 for all samples. The Illumina Truseq RNA Sample Preparation kit V2 was used to prepare libraries from 500 ng total RNAs. PolyA RNAs were purified with polyT-coated magnetic beads, chemically fragmented, and used as template for cDNA synthesis using random hexamers. cDNA ends were subsequently end-blunted, adenylated at 3′OH extremities, and ligated to indexed adaptors. Finally, the adapters ligated library fragments were enriched by PCR following Illumina’s protocol and purified. Libraries were validated on the Bioanalyser DNA 1000 chip and quantified by qPCR using the KAPA library quantification kit. Sequencing was performed on HiSeq2000 in paired-end 2 × 100 base protocol. For data analysis, Fastq files were not trimmed for adaptor sequences. The reads were aligned with Tophat 2.0.9 to the mouse genome mm10. Cufflinks 2.1.1 suite was used to normalize data and generate FPKM values and CuffDiff was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes.

31792136	        <p>Next, we sought to determine whether these observations might be relevant in human colitis. We investigated the expression of IL22-responsive transcriptional networks and the ER stress response in colonic tissue from CD patients with active colitis. To address this question, we interrogated transcriptomic, serological and clinical data from a large cohort of patients with active colonic CD from the UNITI study, a large phase III trial programme evaluating the efficacy of ustekinumab, a human IgG1κ mAb targeting the p40 subunit common to both IL12 and IL23.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Colonic biopsies were sampled at baseline (ie, before administration of the study drug) and longitudinally following initiation of drug. In both UNITI-1 and UNITI-2 cohorts, serum IL22 concentration was significantly increased in comparison with healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5A</xref>). We evaluated tissue transcriptomics in rectal biopsies of patients with CD from the UNITI cohort at baseline in comparison with healthy control subjects, who were not part of the UNITI trial programme but whose biopsy gene expression data were generated and analysed in parallel. Using the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform, the probe sets for cytokines, including IL22, IL17A and TNF, generally hybridised at low intensity, such that comparison of cytokine transcripts between the groups was difficult to determine (data not shown). However, we reasoned that if IL22 was biologically active in diseased colonic tissue of patients with colitis, then core IL22-responsive transcripts would be enriched in rectal biopsies of CD patients with active colitis in comparison with non-inflammatory control subjects. We defined a core IL22-responsive transcriptional programme by identifying the human homologues of the 20 most highly upregulated transcripts in IL22-treated colonoids. Strikingly, Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> demonstrated significant enrichment of the IL22-responsive transcriptional module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5B</xref>). These findings were replicated in colonic biopsies sampled from an independent cohort of IBD patients with colonic CD and active UC (GSE16879, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplementary figure 9</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> As well as demonstrating significantly higher expression levels of IL22 responsive transcripts in patients with active colonic IBD, unsupervised hierarchical clustering could fully differentiate CD and UC patients from controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplementary figure 10</xref>). In the UNITI cohort extensive phenotypic data were available, including disease activity scoring, endoscopic severity scoring and measurement of inflammatory biomarkers. Crucially, enrichment scores for IL22-responsive transcripts correlated with biomarkers of disease activity and severity, including faecal lactoferrin and calprotectin concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5C, D</xref>). Moreover, the IL22 enrichment score in rectal biopsies significantly correlated with the severity of mucosal injury scored during endoscopy, calculated using the Simple Endoscopic Score – Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD), which quantifies endoscopically assessed severity of inflammation and is arguably the most important objective marker of CD severity/activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5D</xref>). Principal component analysis demonstrated that IL22 responsive transcripts could discriminate between the presence or absence of epithelial ulceration in the rectum identified during endoscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5E</xref>). To further explore the correlation between IL22 responsive transcripts and severity of mucosal injury, we adopted a machine learning approach to evaluate the ability of IL22-responsive transcripts to predict endoscopic activity (SES-CD). Elastic Net regression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> was conducted to select genes from the IL22 signature to predict endoscopic disease severity. The rectum baseline gene expression data were used for training and those from rectum at week 8 and splenic flexure and terminal ileum at baseline and week 8 served as testing datasets. A model derived from the UNITI-1 discovery data set was predictive of the baseline SES-CD score with R2 of 0.82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5G–H</xref>). We validated the performance of this model in the testing datasets from the same study (r<sup>2</sup> range between 0.35 and 0.64), with the best performance in the week 8 rectum (r<sup>2</sup>=0.64, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5H</xref>), confirming that IL22 responsive transcripts can predict severity of SES-CD in colonic CD. Finally, we asked whether the expression of the IL22-responsive transcriptional module in biopsies sampled at baseline, prior to institution of ustekinumab, could be harnessed to predict response to treatment in the UNITI cohort. Using PCA, the IL22 responsive signature could not differentiate responders and non-responders to ustekinumab in the UNITI cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplementary figure 11</xref>).</p>

32917713	  <body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The intestinal epithelium undergoes a marked change during the neonatal period. Crypt formation occurs after birth together with the appearance of Paneth cells (PCs) and the development of adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Adult ISCs rely on niche factors such as Wnt ligands. In vivo, mesenchymal cells are important sources of Wnt to support ISC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>), whereas in vitro, it is PCs that are required to supply the necessary Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). In contrast, Wnt ligands or PCs are dispensable for fetal organoid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Thus, ISCs undergo a fetal-to-adult transition that includes a change in Wnt dependency.</p><p>Recently, the existence of bona fide fetal ISCs has been challenged by the finding that any fetal epithelial cell can be or become an adult ISC as long as the appropriate environment is supplied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). This model fits nicely with studies showing that after injury, the intestinal epithelium is temporarily reprogrammed into a fetal-like state that is needed for proper repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). This, in turn, complements work specifying that adult intestinal epithelial lineages can dedifferentiate to give rise to new ISCs to rebuild the epithelium after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). In hindsight, these high levels of cell fate reversion make sense because the intestine is a common site for chemical and mechanical challenges as well as the host for many putative pathogens. Nonetheless, it is not yet fully understood how the fetal-to-adult ISC transition, or its reversal upon injury, is mediated, and whether epithelial reprogramming can be targeted therapeutically.</p><p>Adult ISCs give rise to all intestinal epithelial subtypes, and ISCs have a strikingly similar chromatin landscape compared to enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>). In contrast, the epigenetic makeup of secretory progenitors is distinguishable from ISCs and enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>), which was reversed upon irradiation when these secretory precursors dedifferentiate into ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Three groups separately identified a crucial role for the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in maintaining crypt physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). In summary, although it is clear that there is an important role for certain epigenetic modifiers in intestinal epithelial biology, the role and importance of others remain undefined. Here, we exploit the availability of chemical probes targeting epigenetic modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>), and combine it with intestinal organoid cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>), to identify the demethylase LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) as a critical regulator of postnatal epithelial maturation including PC differentiation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of LSD1 as a regulator of PCs</title><p>The intestinal epithelium undergoes a marked change during the neonatal period including the appearance of PCs. To study PC differentiation in organoids, we developed a differentiation protocol [adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>)] using CHIR [glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor] and DAPT (γ-secretase inhibitor) to activate Wnt and block Notch signaling, respectively (fig. S1A). CHIR-DAPT (CD) treatment led to a robust enrichment of lysozyme<sup>+</sup> PCs by confocal microscopy, mRNA, and protein expression compared to standard EGF (epidermal growth factor), Noggin, and R-spondin 1 (ENR) organoid growing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig.

Next, we tested chemical probes targeting 18 methyltransferases and demethylases and identified the LSD1 inhibitor GSK-LSD1 to consistently repress PC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>; fig. S1, C and D; and table S1). In support, GSK-LSD1 similarly affected PC differentiation in organoids grown in ENR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and fig. S1E), and use of a different LSD1 inhibitor (ORY-1001) led to a similar near loss of PCs (fig. S1F). Consistent with the irreversible binding nature of GSK-LSD1 to its target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>), we found that upon withdrawal of GSK-LSD1, PCs reappeared after two organoid splitting events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and fig.

To test whether only a selection or all PC genes are down-regulated upon LSD1 inhibition, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on organoids treated with GSK-LSD1 for 24 hours, between day 1 and 2 after splitting, which we anticipate is right when PCs develop. We found a robust down-regulation of all PC-specific genes [gene set from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>).

We did observe that KO mice had “escaper” crypts still expressing LSD1, and LSD1<sup>+</sup> crypts were positive for lysozyme (fig. S1J). Thus, these mice do not completely lack PCs.

S1, M and N). In contrast, both KO and WT organoids could not sustain growth in medium lacking R-spondin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>). Thus, loss of LSD1 activity in ISCs renders them not requiring (endogenous) Wnt for growth and even leads to expansion of this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, GSK-LSD1 is not able to replace <italic>Wnt3A</italic> in the ability to form organoids from single ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>).

Unlike fetal organoids, KO organoids cannot grow without R-spondin 1. In addition, KO organoids form crypts, whereas fetal or Wnt-supplemented organoids mainly grow as spheroids.

In addition, we found very limited overlap of an ISC-unique gene set with those up-regulated in KO crypts (fig. 2SD).

These fetal genes are normally not expressed in ISCs or any other adult intestinal epithelial cell types and instead are aberrantly expressed in adult KO crypts. We conclude that up-regulation of fetal genes in our bulk RNA-seq is thus not due to the enrichment of ISCs in KO crypts.

GSK-LSD1 treatment completely abrogated PC differentiation independently of YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>).

This supports our hypothesis that KO mice have intestinal epithelium that is “stuck” at a P7 stage, lacking PCs, with reduced GC and immature enteroendocrine cells, but with crypts containing ISC-like cells. When we compared genes up-regulated in KO crypts to different developmental stages, we see overlap with both E18.5 and P7 stages compared to P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>).

We did not observe major differences in global H3K4me1/2 levels by immunohistochemistry comparing escaper LSD1<sup>+</sup> crypts in KO tissue (fig. S3A). To assess whether LSD1 mediates H3K4 demethylation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 comparing sorted WT and KO crypt cells. Analysis of ChIP-seq for H3K4me1 identified 2059 sites with associated altered methylation levels (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.01), of which the majority (1622) were enriched in KO crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). ChIP-seq of H3K4me2 revealed a very similar pattern, and the large majority of genes affected by LSD1 with gain of H3K4me2 were also significant in the analysis for H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). A previous study found that although ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) allowed a separation of enterocyte progenitors and secretory progenitors in their chromatin state, H3K4me2 levels at these sites were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). This suggests that the differences that we observed in our H3K4me1/2 ChIP-seq analysis are not due to differences in adult cell populations between WT and KO crypts. Nevertheless, most of these peaks are not in close proximity to transcriptional start sites (TSSs) (fig. S3B). The top 300 genes associated with increased H3K4me1 levels in the KO are overall enriched in the KO transcriptional profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Furthermore, using a high stringency (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.01), we combined our RNA-seq and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data to establish a core list of 228 genes that are mediated by the enzymatic activity of LSD1 (table S2). Eighty-four percent of the increased H3K4me1 peaks associated with these 228 genes are located outside the 2-kb surrounding the TSS. This suggests that LSD1 would drive enhancer-mediated regulation of these genes, which fits with a role generally associated with LSD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>). The LSD1 core signature is enriched in a transcriptional profile comparing fetal with adult organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>).

In contrast, ChIP levels that are low in E18.5 or P7 display a stepwise increase that culminates at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).

The role we find for LSD1 in suppressing fetal/neonatal genes is near opposite of what recently was found in skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). In skin epithelium, inhibition of LSD1 leads to the increase of fate-determining transcription factors and subsequent differentiation, and this enhanced differentiation led to inhibition of skin cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>).

YAP/TAZ are sensors of mechanical signals, so it is plausible that upon damage and subsequent extracellular matrix cues, YAP/TAZ are activated by control of their protein levels. We found a clear reduction of LSD1 levels after irradiation, which coincides with an increase in YAP levels. Although it is unclear how LSD1 levels are controlled after regeneration, in glioblastoma tumor cells GSK3β stabilizes LSD1 by direct phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Thus, activation of the Wnt pathway, which occurs during the regenerating phase, could lead to fast reduction of LSD1 levels by Wnt-controlled inhibition of GSK3. We further found that LSD1 represses a reparative gene expression profile, similar to that activated by YAP. However, GSK-LSD1–mediated depletion of PCs was completely independent of YAP/TAZ. In combination, after damage, reducing levels of the repressor LSD1 and inducing levels of activators YAP/TAZ can together mediate a robust reparative response.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that inhibition of LSD1 may be a viable target for the reprogramming of intestinal epithelium into a reparative state that is beneficial after injury, such as inflicted by radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animal work</title><p><italic>Lgr5</italic>-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 (stock no. 008875) mouse strain was obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Villin</italic>-Cre and <italic>Villin</italic>-CreERT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>) were a gift from S.

Crypt formation occurs after birth together with the appearance of Paneth cells (PCs) and the development of adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Adult ISCs rely on niche factors such as Wnt ligands. In vivo, mesenchymal cells are important sources of Wnt to support ISC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>), whereas in vitro, it is PCs that are required to supply the necessary Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). In contrast, Wnt ligands or PCs are dispensable for fetal organoid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Thus, ISCs undergo a fetal-to-adult transition that includes a change in Wnt dependency.</p><p>Recently, the existence of bona fide fetal ISCs has been challenged by the finding that any fetal epithelial cell can be or become an adult ISC as long as the appropriate environment is supplied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). This model fits nicely with studies showing that after injury, the intestinal epithelium is temporarily reprogrammed into a fetal-like state that is needed for proper repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). This, in turn, complements work specifying that adult intestinal epithelial lineages can dedifferentiate to give rise to new ISCs to rebuild the epithelium after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). In hindsight, these high levels of cell fate reversion make sense because the intestine is a common site for chemical and mechanical challenges as well as the host for many putative pathogens. Nonetheless, it is not yet fully understood how the fetal-to-adult ISC transition, or its reversal upon injury, is mediated, and whether epithelial reprogramming can be targeted therapeutically.</p><p>Adult ISCs give rise to all intestinal epithelial subtypes, and ISCs have a strikingly similar chromatin landscape compared to enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>). In contrast, the epigenetic makeup of secretory progenitors is distinguishable from ISCs and enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>), which was reversed upon irradiation when these secretory precursors dedifferentiate into ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Three groups separately identified a crucial role for the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in maintaining crypt physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). In summary, although it is clear that there is an important role for certain epigenetic modifiers in intestinal epithelial biology, the role and importance of others remain undefined. Here, we exploit the availability of chemical probes targeting epigenetic modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>), and combine it with intestinal organoid cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>), to identify the demethylase LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) as a critical regulator of postnatal epithelial maturation including PC differentiation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of LSD1 as a regulator of PCs</title><p>The intestinal epithelium undergoes a marked change during the neonatal period including the appearance of PCs. To study PC differentiation in organoids, we developed a differentiation protocol [adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>)] using CHIR [glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor] and DAPT (γ-secretase inhibitor) to activate Wnt and block Notch signaling, respectively (fig. S1A). CHIR-DAPT (CD) treatment led to a robust enrichment of lysozyme<sup>+</sup> PCs by confocal microscopy, mRNA, and protein expression compared to standard EGF (epidermal growth factor), Noggin, and R-spondin 1 (ENR) organoid growing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig. S1B). Next, we tested chemical probes targeting 18 methyltransferases and demethylases and identified the LSD1 inhibitor GSK-LSD1 to consistently repress PC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>; fig. S1, C and D; and table S1). In support, GSK-LSD1 similarly affected PC differentiation in organoids grown in ENR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and fig. S1E), and use of a different LSD1 inhibitor (ORY-1001) led to a similar near loss of PCs (fig. S1F). Consistent with the irreversible binding nature of GSK-LSD1 to its target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>), we found that upon withdrawal of GSK-LSD1, PCs reappeared after two organoid splitting events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and fig.

To test the role of LSD1 in ISCs, we used <italic>Lgr5</italic>–enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)–derived organoids and treated them with GSK-LSD1 in normal ENR medium. We found that GSK-LSD1 treatment resulted in a three- to fivefold increase in percentage of LGR5<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). We define LGR5<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> cells by GFP<sup>HIGH</sup>, as it was previously shown that these cells, but not GFP<sup>LOW</sup> cells, have clonal capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). To test whether only a selection or all PC genes are down-regulated upon LSD1 inhibition, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on organoids treated with GSK-LSD1 for 24 hours, between day 1 and 2 after splitting, which we anticipate is right when PCs develop. We found a robust down-regulation of all PC-specific genes [gene set from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Thus, GSK-LSD1 treatment expands the LGR5<sup>+</sup> population and renders these cells independent of PC-derived <italic>Wnt3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, I and J</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Wnt3</italic> expression, we did not observe a lack of other niche factors including Notch ligands such as <italic>Dll1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). Notch ligands are not uniquely expressed by PCs and also can be found in enteroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>). We further found that GSK-LSD1 treatment led to down-regulation of genes associated with goblet cells (GCs) but not enteroendocrine cells (fig. S1H). In addition, 24-hour GSK-LSD1 treatment did not lead to an expansion of the LGR5<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>). Thus, the expansion of LGR5<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> cells upon LSD1 inhibition does not precede or outcompete PC loss and may be a separate event. Nevertheless, using a recently described culture condition that allows PC differentiation in human organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>), we found that GSK-LSD1 also blocks PC differentiation in human organoids while simultaneously expanding the LGR5<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, L and M</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>LSD1 is required for PCs but not goblet or enteroendocrine cells in vivo</title><p>To test the role of LSD1 in vivo, we crossed <italic>Lsd1</italic><sup>f/f</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>) with <italic>Villin-</italic>Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>) mice to delete <italic>Lsd1</italic> in intestinal epithelial cells specifically [knockout (KO) mice]. Although these mice appear normal, we found that KO mice lack PCs throughout the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and fig. S1I). We did observe that KO mice had “escaper” crypts still expressing LSD1, and LSD1<sup>+</sup> crypts were positive for lysozyme (fig. S1J). Thus, these mice do not completely lack PCs. Now, two genes are known to be absolutely required for PC differentiation in vivo: <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>).

Next, we examined other intestinal secretory lineages and found a reduction of GCs, but equal numbers of enteroendocrine cells, comparing adult wild-type (WT) and KO littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). When we examined fetal and postnatal intestines of WT and KO littermates, we found that the reduction in GCs emerges after developmental stage P7, similar to when PCs start to develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>, and fig.

These results suggest that LSD1 KO epithelium maintains neonatal characteristics into adulthood, including the absence of PCs and fewer GCs.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>LSD1 is required for crypt maturation in vivo and Wnt dependency of organoids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of antibody (lysozyme and SOX9) and in situ hybridization (ISH) (<italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Wnt3</italic>) staining of WT and KO small intestinal tissue.

We found OLFM4<sup>+</sup> cells completely filling the bottom of crypts in KO mice compared to the standard PC/ISC pattern observed in WT crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref> and fig.

In contrast, <italic>Lsd1</italic> WT and KO crypts were equally able to form organoids, even in the absence of PCs in KO organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that KO organoids do not rely on endogenous Wnt. Blockage of Wnt signaling by the porcupine inhibitor IWP-2 showed that treated KO organoids sustained growth unlike WT organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>). IWP-2 distinctively reduced growth rate in KO organoids, which makes long-term expansion unfeasible; yet, after splitting, there were still surviving KO organoids under continuous IWP-2 treatment, and LSD1 inhibitor treatment greatly increased splitting efficiency (fig. S1, M and N). In contrast, both KO and WT organoids could not sustain growth in medium lacking R-spondin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>). Thus, loss of LSD1 activity in ISCs renders them not requiring (endogenous) Wnt for growth and even leads to expansion of this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, GSK-LSD1 is not able to replace <italic>Wnt3A</italic> in the ability to form organoids from single ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). Although KO organoids resemble aspects of those derived from fetal epithelium that also lack PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>), there are some key distinctions. Unlike fetal organoids, KO organoids cannot grow without R-spondin 1. In addition, KO organoids form crypts, whereas fetal or Wnt-supplemented organoids mainly grow as spheroids. It is possible that enteroendocrine progenitors that express Notch ligands such as <italic>Dll1/4</italic> are sufficient to allow crypt formation in KO organoids.</p><p>Our data thus suggest that adult KO epithelium is in between fetal and adult: KO organoids do not rely on Wnt yet are unable to grow without R-spondin 1, and KO epithelium in vivo lacks PCs and has reduced GC numbers yet with crypts that have OLFM4<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> ISCs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>LSD1 represses fetal and neonatal genes that allows PC differentiation independent of YAP/TAZ</title><p>Next, we sought to find the mechanism by which LSD1 controls intestinal epithelial biology.

Together, this suggests that inhibition of LSD1 rapidly leads to enzyme-independent derepression of GFI1-targeted enteroendocrine-progenitor markers that, in turn, can limit PC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Furthermore, these enteroendocrine progenitors may take over the role of PCs in Notch-dependent crypt formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>). However, it does not explain the expansion of ISCs, the complete loss of PCs, or the lack of expansion of mature ChgA<sup><bold>+</bold></sup> cells that we observe in KO epithelium, which thus contradict a primarily GFI1-mediated mechanism.</p><p>Over the years, there have been various different ISC and stem cell–like populations described, either using genetic markers such as <italic>Lgr5</italic> or <italic>Bmi1</italic> or by techniques such as label-retaining capacity and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>). To test whether there was enrichment for a certain stem cell type, we analyzed expression of defining genes for each population (fig. S2, B and C); however, we did not find enrichment for any stem cell subtype including the classical <italic>Lgr5</italic><sup><bold>+</bold></sup> ISC signature. In addition, we found very limited overlap of an ISC-unique gene set with those up-regulated in KO crypts (fig. 2SD). Instead, we find enrichment of two fetal gene sets in the KO transcriptional profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). These fetal genes are normally not expressed in ISCs or any other adult intestinal epithelial cell types and instead are aberrantly expressed in adult KO crypts. We conclude that up-regulation of fetal genes in our bulk RNA-seq is thus not due to the enrichment of ISCs in KO crypts. Recently, two groups elegantly identified and characterized a cellular repair state in the intestinal epithelium that is fetal-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Two repair gene signatures from these studies were also enriched in the KO transcriptional profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Yui <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>) revealed that the reparative state was mediated by YAP/TAZ. A separate YAP gene signature was enriched in our KO transcriptional profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). To test whether YAP/TAZ is required for LSD1-mediated PC differentiation, we deleted YAP/TAZ in an inducible manner (<italic>Vil-</italic>CreERT2;<italic>Yap</italic><sup>f/f</sup>;<italic>Wwtr1</italic><sup>f/f</sup> organoids). Tamoxifen treatment led to near undetectable levels of both <italic>Yap</italic> and <italic>Wwtr1</italic> (fig.

GSK-LSD1 treatment completely abrogated PC differentiation independently of YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>).

This supports our hypothesis that KO mice have intestinal epithelium that is “stuck” at a P7 stage, lacking PCs, with reduced GC and immature enteroendocrine cells, but with crypts containing ISC-like cells. When we compared genes up-regulated in KO crypts to different developmental stages, we see overlap with both E18.5 and P7 stages compared to P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). In a separate test, we found enrichment by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for our own fetal (E18vsP7) and neonatal (P7vsP21) gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>LSD1 controls H3K4me1 levels of genes associated with a fetal-like profile</title><p>LSD1 controls embryonic development by repressing enhancers to allow embryonic stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>).

Analysis of ChIP-seq for H3K4me1 identified 2059 sites with associated altered methylation levels (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.01), of which the majority (1622) were enriched in KO crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).

A previous study found that although ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) allowed a separation of enterocyte progenitors and secretory progenitors in their chromatin state, H3K4me2 levels at these sites were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). This suggests that the differences that we observed in our H3K4me1/2 ChIP-seq analysis are not due to differences in adult cell populations between WT and KO crypts. Nevertheless, most of these peaks are not in close proximity to transcriptional start sites (TSSs) (fig. S3B). The top 300 genes associated with increased H3K4me1 levels in the KO are overall enriched in the KO transcriptional profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Furthermore, using a high stringency (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.01), we combined our RNA-seq and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data to establish a core list of 228 genes that are mediated by the enzymatic activity of LSD1 (table S2). Eighty-four percent of the increased H3K4me1 peaks associated with these 228 genes are located outside the 2-kb surrounding the TSS. This suggests that LSD1 would drive enhancer-mediated regulation of these genes, which fits with a role generally associated with LSD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>). The LSD1 core signature is enriched in a transcriptional profile comparing fetal with adult organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>).

We next performed H3K4me1 ChIP-seq on FACS-sorted epithelium at different developmental stages. As an example, we find a stepwise increase of H3K4me1 levels near the ISC marker gene <italic>Olfm4</italic>, whereas another ISC marker, <italic>Lgr5</italic>, has mostly unchanged H3K4me1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). When we systemically assess differential sites, we find that there is an abrupt loss of H3K4me1 at P21 from sites that are significantly up in E18.5 and P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, ChIP levels that are low in E18.5 or P7 display a stepwise increase that culminates at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).

However, when we take these sites and display the H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data of WT versus KO crypts, we find a complete lack of regulation of sites lost at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).

The role we find for LSD1 in suppressing fetal/neonatal genes is near opposite of what recently was found in skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). In skin epithelium, inhibition of LSD1 leads to the increase of fate-determining transcription factors and subsequent differentiation, and this enhanced differentiation led to inhibition of skin cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). Similarly, in other cancer types including intestinal tumors in zebrafish, LSD1 inhibition leads to differentiation and reduced tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>). In the intestine, this would fit with our finding of the rapid increase in enteroendocrine progenitor genes <italic>Neurog3</italic> and <italic>Neurod1</italic> likely in a GFI1-mediated manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and fig.

However, unlike in GFI1KO mice, LSD1KO epithelium does not have a robust expansion of mature enteroendocrine cells, nor does it have a near loss of ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). We propose that the H3K4me1-mediated control of fetal/postnatal genes overrules the ability of enteroendocrine progenitors to mature, and it allows the expansion of ISC-like cells at the bottom of crypts and in organoids.</p><p>Intestinal epithelial repair is crucial to prevent chronic disease, and YAP/TAZ are established initiators and critical regulators of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). YAP/TAZ are sensors of mechanical signals, so it is plausible that upon damage and subsequent extracellular matrix cues, YAP/TAZ are activated by control of their protein levels. We found a clear reduction of LSD1 levels after irradiation, which coincides with an increase in YAP levels. Although it is unclear how LSD1 levels are controlled after regeneration, in glioblastoma tumor cells GSK3β stabilizes LSD1 by direct phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Thus, activation of the Wnt pathway, which occurs during the regenerating phase, could lead to fast reduction of LSD1 levels by Wnt-controlled inhibition of GSK3. We further found that LSD1 represses a reparative gene expression profile, similar to that activated by YAP. However, GSK-LSD1–mediated depletion of PCs was completely independent of YAP/TAZ. In combination, after damage, reducing levels of the repressor LSD1 and inducing levels of activators YAP/TAZ can together mediate a robust reparative response.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that inhibition of LSD1 may be a viable target for the reprogramming of intestinal epithelium into a reparative state that is beneficial after injury, such as inflicted by radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animal work</title><p><italic>Lgr5</italic>-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 (stock no. 008875) mouse strain was obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Villin</italic>-Cre and <italic>Villin</italic>-CreERT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>) were a gift from S.

33027665	          <p id="P59">Sequencing RNA libraries, passed through quality filter (cluster density, total yield, and per-cycle base quality), were then split by library barcodes using bcl2fastq (v.1.8.4) and default setting. A 6bp of cell barcodes and another 6bp UMI were in Read1 of 18bp reads. The extra bases were added to prevent misleading interrupted sequences by accident. The sequence of transcript was in Read2 of 36bp reads. We adopted CEL-seq2 pipelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://github.com/yanailab/celseq2">https://github.com/yanailab/celseq2</ext-link>) to process the single cell data. To demultiplex the data, we split Read2 into separate files based on the cell barcode from Read1 and attached UMI to Read2 metadata. Unclassified sequences were 0~20% of total reads in scRNA-seq and 0~40% of total reads from samples subjected to parallel sequencing. We then mapped the reads of each cell to a mouse reference genome (mm9) using Bowtie2 (v.2.3.4). Average mapped sequences were over 70% of total reads in scRNA-seq and over 50% in samples subjected to parallel sequencing. Finally, we identified and eliminated reads sharing the same UMI, and then generated an accurate molecule count for each gene followed by converting the number of UMIs into transcript counts. Average gene complexity was 6000 in scRNA-seq and 3000~4000 in the samples in which we sequenced both RNA and the timestamp barcode from gDNA sequencing. We used transcript counts as a digital gene expression matrix for downstream analysis. Resulting fastq files were deposited in GEO (GSE140890).</p>

24982636	      <p>Since the availability of whole genome arrays, four studies (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2006</xref>; Campos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2013</xref>; Milani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2013</xref>; Laporta and Welsh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2013</xref>) on the effects of VDR agonists [three with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, one with a synthetic VDR agonist] in breast cancer model systems have reported although only one of these datasets (Milani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2013</xref>, accession #GSE27220) is publically available on the Gene Expression Omnibus website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>). Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2006</xref>) compared the effects of 1 nM RO3582, a Gemini 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> analog, on pre-malignant (MCF10AT1) and malignant (MCF10CA1a) breast cancer cells and identified distinct gene expression profiles for each cell line. Similar to the comparison of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Swami et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2003</xref>), more significant changes in gene expression were observed in the less malignant MCF10AT1 cells than in the invasive MCF10CA1a cells (391 vs. 156, respectively, 12 h treatment; 2-fold cutoff). Despite the reduced sensitivity in the more aggressive cells, the overlap in target genes was considerable (about 55% of the genes altered in MCF10AT1 cells were similarly altered in the MCF10CA1a cells); the complete gene lists are available as supplemental data.</p>
33036232	        <p>To select a miRNA for detargeting experiments, we accessed publicly available data through NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under serial number GSE22145 that compared basal cells vs. columnar cells in nasal airway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-genes-11-01169">14</xref>] and found seven miRNAs that were consistently expressed in basal cells but not columnar cells from the nasal epithelia of three donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01169-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). To evaluate the expression of miRNA expression in our cultured human tracheobronchial basal cells expanded in SAGM-EA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-genes-11-01169">9</xref>], we used a TaqMan low-density array (TLDA; Applied Biosystems) to quantify relative expression of 377 miRNAs (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-11-01169">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). Expression of 252 miRNAs was consistently detected in basal cells at passage 3 and at passage 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01169-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Of these miRNAs, only nine changed significantly between passage 3 and 18 (FDR test with Q = 5%) and 171 miRNAs did not exceed a ± 2-fold change in expression in the passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01169-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Using a less stringent test, expression of 15 miRNAs changed significantly between passage 3 and 18 (unadjusted <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 and absolute fold change ≥ 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01169-f001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>
33036232	        <p>miR-106b, miR-25 and miR-93 belong to the miR-106b-25 cluster that is located in the 13th intron of mini-chromosome maintenance complex component 7 gene (<italic>MCM7</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-genes-11-01169">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-genes-11-01169">17</xref>]. We prepared miRNA samples from six donors and analyzed the relative expression of these miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01169-f001">Figure 1</xref>F). The expression levels were fairly consistent between the six random donor samples. Notably, although these miRNAs are in the same cistron, their expression varied over a 10-fold range in airway basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-01169-f001">Figure 1</xref>F), and the pattern of expression of each of the three miRNAs was also different than that reported for the miR-106b-25 cluster in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-genes-11-01169">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-genes-11-01169">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-genes-11-01169">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-genes-11-01169">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-genes-11-01169">22</xref>]. Although miR-93 was expressed at ~4.5-fold higher levels than miR-106b, we chose to move forward with miR-106b since miR-93 was observed to be expressed in differentiated human nasal columnar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-genes-11-01169">14</xref>] (GEO dataset: GSE22145). </p>

32365491	        <p>In Ross-Adams’ cohort (GSE70770) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48-cancers-12-01106">48</xref>], we observed no correlation between <italic>ZBTB38</italic> expression level and patient’s age (<italic>p</italic> = 0.373), extra capsular extension (<italic>p</italic> = 0.54), Gleason score (<italic>p</italic> = 0.918), clinical grade (<italic>p</italic> = 0.681), pathological grade of the tumour (<italic>p</italic> = 0.194) and PSA levels at diagnosis (<italic>p</italic> = 0.289) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="cancers-12-01106-t002">Table 2</xref>). The only correlation we observed is with surgical margin status (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0003) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="cancers-12-01106-t002">Table 2</xref>). </p>
32365491	        <p>In the cohort of Taylor et al. (GSE21034) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-cancers-12-01106">12</xref>] we noticed that tumours with low expression of <italic>ZBTB38</italic> (using the median expression value of <italic>ZBTB38</italic> in the cohort) present high level of genomic instability define by heightened copy number aberrations (<italic>p</italic> = 0.028) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="cancers-12-01106-t004">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, substantial copy number aberrations are associated with a poor clinical outcome in this cohort as described for “<italic>ZBTB38</italic>-low” tumours. </p>
32365491	        <p>Microarray datasets were collected from the GEO repository (<uri ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</uri> gds), the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics portal (<uri ns0:href="http://cbioportal.org">http://cbioportal.org</uri>) and the web-based cancer genomics resource Oncomine (<uri ns0:href="https://www.oncomine.org/">https://www.oncomine.org/</uri>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66-cancers-12-01106">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67-cancers-12-01106">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-cancers-12-01106">68</xref>]. We selected all datasets reporting high-throughput gene expression in localised and metastatic prostate tumours using normal (or benign) prostate tissues as controls, with at least five specimens in each group (benign/normal and cancerous). Twenty-six datasets met these requirements but array platforms often lack probes to monitor <italic>ZBTB38</italic> expression (e.g., GSE6099, GSE62872 and GSE6919). We eventually considered for our analysis the following datasets: GSE21032 (ZBTB38 ID: 4299) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-cancers-12-01106">12</xref>], GSE14206 (ZBTB38 ID: A_23_P212025) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50-cancers-12-01106">50</xref>], GSE55945 (ZBTB38 ID: 15558733_at) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49-cancers-12-01106">49</xref>], GSE3325 (ZBTB38 ID: 15558733_at) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47-cancers-12-01106">47</xref>], GSE3933 (ZBTB38 ID: IMAGE50920) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-cancers-12-01106">45</xref>], Oncomine dataset VanajaProstate (ZBTB38 ID:22512_at) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51-cancers-12-01106">51</xref>], GSE68545 (ZBTB38 ID:RC_AA465527) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-cancers-12-01106">46</xref>], GSE35988 (ZBTB38 ID: A_23_P380076) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-cancers-12-01106">14</xref>] and GSE70770 (ZBTB38 ID: ILMN_2248843) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48-cancers-12-01106">48</xref>]. A full description of the experimental protocols (including the number of samples, the methods to isolate RNA samples and the technology platform used for gene expression analysis) and clinical review of these datasets is available elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-cancers-12-01106">1</xref>] and in the respective GSE reports. </p>
32365491	        <p>Gene expression datasets were filtered to compare localised tumours with highest expression levels of <italic>ZBTB38</italic> (4<sup>th</sup> quartile) and tumours with lowest expression levels of <italic>ZBTB38</italic> (1<sup>st</sup> quartile). GEO2R was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the different cohorts, using <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 as cut-off. Five studies report gene expression by array for &gt;50 patients with localised tumours (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-12-01106-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). We excluded the Lapointe et al. dataset (GSE3933) because of the poor relationship between probe and gene identifiers. We eventually considered Taylor et al. (GSE21032), Grasso et al. (GSE35988), Kunderfranco et al. (GSE14206) and Ross-Adams et al. (GSE70770). The web-based g-profiler portal (<uri ns0:href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost">https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost</uri>) was used to homogenise gene names and perform subsequent overlaps between the different lists of differentially expressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69-cancers-12-01106">69</xref>]. </p>

32080178	        <p id="Par20">To investigate the role of REST in the exocrine pancreas, GSEA was performed on the gene expression profiles of normal human pancreas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues as described in the “Materials and methods” section. The REST target genes were highly enriched (i.e., upregulated in the normal pancreas with low <italic>REST</italic> expression) in both the large (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>) and small REST target gene sets (Suppl Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1A</xref>). In the GSEA that used 572 transcription factors and transcription factor binding sites as the gene set database, 57 of the 572 gene sets were upregulated in normal pancreas.

29296175	        <p>To assess global gene expression in 2D versus 3D cultures we performed Affymetrix Gene Chip analysis using total RNA isolated from HCC827 cells. Microarray data can be accessed under Gene Expression Omnibus Accession Number (GSE102722). In the present study, we focused on the expression of apoptosis-associated genes, as they might have an impact on the differential drug efficacies in the 2D and 3D cultures. Affymetrix Gene Chip data were imported into R to be further processed using oligo and limma packages of R. As depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, the expression of a large array of genes involved in apoptosis was substantially increased in the 3D spheroids of HCC827 cells. A comprehensive list of genes annotated with the GO Term apoptotic process (GO:006915) can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006915">http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006915</ext-link>. Using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software package we could identify major changes in gene expression in the <italic>TNF/FAS</italic> and growth factor signaling cascades (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The expression rate of MAP-kinases was mostly reduced, whereas the gene expression of signaling interfaces of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic program was upregulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Major players in apoptosis that were differentially expressed in the 2D and 3D cultures include <italic>TNFR1, BFL-1, BAX, BAK, DIABLO, BCL2, NFkB, CASP3 and CASP7</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p>
24875049	          <p>To find a set of best-discriminating genes, we followed a leave-one-out cross validation strategy. For each cell line we excluded both samples (0 and 48 hour time points) once and determined the 100 most significant probe sets, between the remaining strong/weak oscillator phenotypes. We used moderated t-test to select the most discriminative genes ranked by confidence (p-value). Following this procedure we obtained 6 lists. The quality of each list was evaluated as follows: 1) we generated a heatmap using expression profiles for all six cell lines using the current list of 100 discriminating probes. 2) For heatmaps which correctly cluster the excluded cell line into the expected group, results are retained. We found this procedure to be more robust than global comparison of all arrays, because outliers were filtered out through the intersection. This procedure was repeated for all six different cell lines. 3) Finally, we generated a discriminative list of 45 genes by taking the intersection between all useful discriminative gene-lists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004338.s010">Text S1</xref>). The microarray dataset was submitted to GEO with the ref: GSE46549 and will be released upon publication.</p>
31296574	        <p>ST1361 is a DLBCL patient-derived xenograft model developed using a DLBCL tumor originated in a metastatic site from a 58-year-old chemotherapy-naïve Hispanic male. ST1361 was GCB subtype transformed from an Epstein-Barr virus negative FL tumor.</p>
31296574	        <p>To further evaluate the activity of daratumumab alone or in combination with the standard-of-care therapy we used a clinically more relevant patient-derived DLBCL xenograft model (ST1361) with detectable CD38 expression by immunohistochemistry (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S6</italic>). Identical to the MCL and tFL models, all individual treatments were capable of reducing tumor volume over time (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-1051032">Figure 6A</xref>); however, daratumumab alone was strikingly efficient with an anti-tumor activity comparable to R-CHOP (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-1051032">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of daratumumab to either CHOP or R-CHOP led to full tumor regression (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-1051032">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, tumor volume negatively correlated very well with the OS of xenograft-bearing mice, regardless the treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-1051032">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, mice treated with either daratumumab alone or R-CHOP displayed identical OS and, in line with the full tumor regression achieved, daratumumab combined with either CHOP or R-CHOP resulted in 100% survival at the end of the experiment (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 after Bonferroni multiplicity correction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-1051032">Figure 6A</xref>). Remarkably, full tumor regression and 100% survival at day 60 were observed even when daratumumab treatment was ceased as early as 14 days (total of three doses) after tumor cell inoculation. Collectively, these results indicate that tumor cells were completely eliminated within a short time and that no tumor escape occurred in this DLBCL patient-derived model.</p>

29559846	        <p>To investigate the FZD7 expression level in gastric cancer, we first analyzed FZD7 mRNA expression in human gastric cancer and normal gastric tissues by querying the ONCOMINE database. GSE27342 expression dataset from 80 gastric cancer and 80 normal gastric tissue specimens, GSE13861 expression dataset from 31 gastric cancer and 19 normal gastric tissue specimens and GSE19826 expression dataset including 12 gastric cancer, 3 gastric mucosa and 12 whole gastric tissue specimens were chosen in our study. These datasets indicated that FZD7 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in gastric cancers in comparison with normal gastric tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). To identify the protein expression of FZD7 in GC samples, FZD7 was detected by IHC in 251 primary GC specimens and 60 non-neoplastic tissues. In 60 non-neoplastic tissues, FZD7 was expressed in cytoplasm and occasionally at cell membrane in epithelial cells. The negative staining was found in 20 cases, weak or moderate staining (IRS≤3) in 37 cases and strong staining (IRS&gt;4) in only 3 cases. Since the levels of FZD7 expression in most normal gastric tissues were negative or weak (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B), IRS≤3 was defined as normal expression level and IRS&gt;4 was considered as over-expression in the present study. Using this criteria, over-expression of FZD7 was observed in 100/251 (47.8%) of the gastric cancers, which was significantly higher than that in non-neoplastic tissues (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). The association of FZD7 over-expression with the clinicopathologic characteristics of the patient cohort was furtherly evaluated, which was summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

30781344	        <p>The heterogeneity of tumor cells, the lack of tissue oxygenation or increased inflammation in the TME induce modifications of the ECM protein components, resulting in increased ECM density and stiffness mainly from an increased collagen deposition, the so-called desmoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-ijms-20-00840">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-ijms-20-00840">23</xref>]. As the tumor progresses, the ECM becomes more disorganized due local modulations of the ECM within the TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-ijms-20-00840">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-ijms-20-00840">26</xref>]. The ECM composition plays important roles in tumor progression, by providing tumor cells with sustaining proliferative signals, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis and promoting invasion and metastasis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-ijms-20-00840">24</xref>]). The degree of desmoplasia is related to disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-ijms-20-00840">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-ijms-20-00840">24</xref>].

22083351	        <p id="P14">To investigate patterns of response to drug treatment in breast cancer samples placed onto microarray, drug response profiles for VPA and SAHA were created using a series of breast cancer cell lines that were sensitive to each drug. Importantly, our series of breast cancer cell lines represents a diversity of breast cancer phenotypes, including estrogen receptor positive and negative cells and HER2 positive cell lines. While other studies have profiled gene expression changes following treatment with these inhibitors, only a couple of cell lines were used, which may not represent the gene expression changes across different tumor subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Sensitivity for each cell line was determined using dose-response analysis on a panel of breast cancer cell lines listed in the Methods section. Cell lines most sensitive to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, dose-response curves highlighted in red) were then included in the generation of the profile. In order to generate the drug response profiles, we treated sensitive cell lines with an HDAC inhibitor (5 mM VPA or 1.5 μM SAHA) and collected RNA 6 hours later. Microarray analysis was performed, and the top 100 genes correlating to drug response across all cell lines were identified. Heat maps and leave-one-out cross validation curves for each profile are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>. As shown, there are distinct sets of genes that reflect response to HDAC inhibitors in common to the sensitive breast cancer cell lines. Further, leave-one-out cross validation shows the robustness and internal consistency of the drug response profiles. Next, profiles were validated by projecting them into samples from the Connectivity map treated with VPA, a public dataset of prostate cancer cells treated with SAHA (GSE9000), and a public dataset of normal ovarian theca cells treated with VPA (GSE 1615)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Results show that the VPA and SAHA response profiles generated above can accurately identify drug treatment in external datasets in which cells are treated with the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
22083351	        <p id="P15">We then projected the profiles into two large independent gene expression datasets of primary breast tumors (GSE6532 and GSE5460, 539 tumors total). Across the 539 breast tumors analyzed for drug response, there is significant correlation between VPA and SAHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A&amp;B</xref>). These results highlight the similar mechanisms of action of the two drugs, and their similar response profiles in breast tumors. When breast tumors were sorted by different clinical phenotypes (ER−/+, HER+/−, tumor size, and tumor grade), no significant interaction between HDAC inhibitor response and subtype was found, suggesting that response to HDAC inhibitors is independent of these factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).</p>

22083351	        <p>(A) Eighteen breast cancer cell lines were tested for sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors VPA and SAHA. Following treatment of cells with a range of doses, the effective concentration at which 50% of cells respond (EC50) is calculated. The cell lines with dose response curves marked in red showed a higher sensitivity to the drugs compared to cell lines insensitive to drugs (marked in blue), and thus were subsequently used to evaluate the gene expression changes resulting upon drug treatment.

31324052	      <p>To validate this hypothesis, we investigated the gene expression profiles of TNBC patients.

To link this TNBC gene set with specific biological functions, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).-The detailed analytical method can be found in the Supplementary Methods. We discovered that the gene signature of TNBC cells was remarkably similar to that of mammary stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-00965-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The up-regulated genes in mammary stem cells were also enriched in TNBC cells (Gene set ID: M2573), while the down-regulated genes were diminished (Gene set ID: M2574). Additionally, we conducted GSEA using a human breast cell line panel (GSE32474) to compare the genomic signature of TNBC cell lines (BT549, HS578T, and MDA-MB-231) with that of non-TNBC cell lines (MCF7 and T47D), and we identified a total of 653 annotated genes that were differentially expressed in TNBC (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 1E-08, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-00965">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).

Our data are supported by the findings of a previous report by Yehiely and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-cancers-11-00965">17</xref>]. They classified the molecular subtypes of breast cancer by gene expression clustering and discovered a set of TNBC-related genes that included CSC-enriched genes responsible for self-renewal activity, such as c-KIT, TGF-β, α6 integrin subunit, and prion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-cancers-11-00965">17</xref>].</p>
24921652	        <p>Using RNA-Seq, we performed a functional genomic analysis in tumor-initiating fractions of CR4 (small) cells grown adherent to type I collagen versus grown as 3D spheroids, in comparison to the bulk tumor cells (long and dychotomized cells grown under standard culture conditions). Using a HiSeq 2000, we sequenced between 40 and 50 million reads per biological sample, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099091-Vinci1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099091-Antoniou1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0099091-Streppel1">[37]</xref>. Briefly, libraries for NGS were made from 100 nanograms of total RNA. The RNA samples quality was assessed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer. All RNA samples had a RIN above 8. Sequencing libraries were created using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT kit according to manufacturer recommendations. The quality of each library was evaluated with the Agilent bioanalyzer high sensitivity assay, and quantified by qPCR (Kappa Biosystem, CT). The libraries were pooled together at 10 nM based on the qPCR results, and then the pool was quantified again by qPCR. The pooled library was sequenced in one lane of a HiSeq2000 paired end 100bp flow cell. This allowed us to detect which transcripts are differentially expressed among these types of CR4 cells, thus building a comprehensive picture of the activated or repressed signaling pathways. We have found that small CR4 cells grown either as separate holoclones adherent to type I collagen or as 3D floating spheroids possess a large number of differentially expressed genes in comparison to the bulk tumor cells grown under standard culture conditions. Thus, in adherent small CR4 cells and 3D spheroids, 357 and 365 genes, respectively, were overexpressed compared to the CR4 long (bulk) tumor cells. Among these genes, 287 were commonly upregulated, which means that both culture conditions allow for maintenance of the CR4 small cells at stemness state. In particular, both small adherent and 3D spheroids expressed up to several orders of magnitude of upregulation in the following: (i) multiple common markers of stemness, including CD44, CD24, EpCAM, ESA, Lgr5, ALDH1A1 and others; (ii) growth factors, including the epidermal (EGF), fibroblast (FGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) family members; (iii) transcription factors (TFs), including multiple homeobox (CDX1, CDX2, CEACAM6, MSX2) and pluripotency TFs (POU5F1B, Oct4, Sox-2, Sox-9; (iv) inflammatory cytokines and their receptors, including IL18, IL20, IL2RG, IL20RA and others; (v) ABC transporters; (vi) genes responsible for transfer of high energy phosphate from mitochondria (CKMT1 and CKMT1B) and the members of cytochrom P450 family, including CYP2B6, CYP2J2, CYP2S1 and others. Of interest, the tumor-initiating fraction of the CR4 cells overexpressed multiple genes controlling cell-to-cell adhesion, including cadherins (CDH 1, 3 and 17, and CDHR5); intergins (ITGB4); genes encoding tight-junction proteins (CLDN3, 4 and 6, COL17A1 and others); and keratins (KRT19, 20, 23 and KRTAP3-1). This finding supports our traditionally used approach for initial enrichment of the prostate and colon tumor-initiating cells based on their ability to adhere to type I collagen-coated surfaces within 15–20 minutes of incubation.

31530502	        <p id="p0145">To determine which proton-sensing receptor responds to the extracellular acidic tumour microenvironment, we analysed the paired CRC GEO and CRC TCGA dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>a–b). The results showed that only GPR4 was upregulated in both datasets. Further analysis of the CRC TCGA dataset suggested that GPR4 expression was positively associated with shorter overall survival time in CRC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>c). To validate these results, we first detected protein expression level of GPR4 in 3 CRC and adjacent tissue samples. Indeed, the expression of GPR4 was greatly increased in the tumour tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>d). Next, we investigated the correlation between the expression profile of GPR4 and the overall prognosis in a tissue microarray contained 317 CRC specimens; 291 of these specimens with clinical information were chosen for the prognostic analysis. Consistently, the IHC results showed that GPR4 expression was markedly increased in the CRC samples(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>e). The sample expression levels of GPR4 were scored as -, +, ++, or +++, considering the area percentage and intensity of staining (Supplementary Fig. 1). Notably, the expression of GPR4 gradually increased with colorectal cancer progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>f). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analyses were applied to evaluate the clinical correlation between GPR4 expression and the survival rate of CRC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>g). Our data reveal that patients with high GPR4 expression presented shorter survival times than those with low GPR4 expression.

32647253	        <p id="Par52">Importantly, all these different types of preclinical models capture the various facets of colon cancer heterogeneity, including CRIS and CMS subtypes, illustrated by a vast range of published repositories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref></sup>. Before we discuss patterns in therapy sensitivity and resistance that have been identified, we would like to point out that every preclinical model is associated with a certain level of bias in terms of the subgroups that it represents best (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). GEMM for colon cancer were typically driven by APC loss and these mice develop tubular adenomas and epithelial-like tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref></sup>. Novel conditional GEMM have emerged over the last years in which MMR genes are deleted to model MSI colon cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref></sup> or in which APC is not included as a driver gene. These non-canonical GEMM typically give rise to serrated-like adenomas and more invasive and aggressive colon cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref></sup>. Traditional cell lines are enriched for MSI positivity, and primary cell line and organoid cultures adhere more to the CMS2 subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup>. Other patient-derived models are likewise associated with biases: the original organoid establishment protocol is less suitable for generating serrated polyp cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref></sup>, whereas direct PDX appear to be more successfully derived from CMS1 and CMS4 tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup>. Fully individualised therapy selection based on an in vitro or in vivo model is therefore still challenging, as one cannot know up front what technique would establish a personal preclinical model for a particular patient. Studying the responses across panels of models has however yielded valuable insights.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>CMS subtypes in preclinical models.</title><p>Top: Pie charts illustrating distribution of CMS subtypes in different preclinical models compared to distribution amongst patients as reported in Guinney et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>.

32257947	      <p>Regardless of the high response rate to standard therapy, most OC patients develop recurrent chemoresistant disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). Recurrence is believed to be caused by the presence of residual tumor-propagating cells that cannot be completely eradicated by surgical and/or pharmacological regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that among these residual cancer cells some have the key stem cell-like properties such as self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). This small population of cells appears to form and to sustain the tumor bulk population, being responsible for disease recurrence after the first-line treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). In some studies, these cells have been isolated by flow cytometry and were discovered to be enriched in a side population (SP) able to efflux the Hoechst33342 dye by cell transporters using the same mechanism with which normal cells efflux toxic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). Further investigations revealed that these cells have several characteristics in common with normal tissue stem cells. In 2005, Bapat et al. were one of the first groups that characterized the presence of ovarian CSCs from patient ascites, showing tumorigenic properties of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). In addition to self-renewal and the ability to give rise to more differentiated progeny, CSCs are highly tumorigenic and display increased resistance against conventional cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>). As of today, there are still considerable controversies on the OC CSCs due to the heterogeneity of CSC phenotypes, plasticity of CSC states as well as limitations of the current research methodology for CSC characterization. Nevertheless, reliable markers of OC CSCs have been successfully validated by xenograft transplantations of the serial tumor cell dilutions (limiting dilution assay) along with serial tumor transplantation and lineage-tracing assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>). These analyses are currently “gold standard” assays to measure key CSC properties such as self-renewal and multipotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). In support of these preclinical findings, clinical significance of CSCs was recently confirmed by a number of studies demonstrated the association of CSC markers with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcomes of OC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>).</p>

31227713	        <p id="Par27">In order to translate our preclinical findings in mice to a relevant setting in humans, we hypothesized that the extent of mast cell activation might provide retrospective prediction of patient survival. Based on the mast cell activation gene expression signature derived from our in vitro mast cell stimulation with IL-33, we analyzed a publically available data set (DErrico Gastric data set; GEO: GSE13911) for differential expression of the mast cell signature comprising <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL4</italic>, <italic>IL1a</italic>, <italic>IL4</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>IL13</italic>, <italic>CSF2</italic>, and <italic>CCL7</italic>. With the exception of IL-4 and IL-13, we found that all other factors were at least 1.6-fold increase in the cancer samples (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>). We therefore assigned the differentially expressed factors (i.e., <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL4</italic>, <italic>IL1a</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>CSF2</italic>, and <italic>CCL7</italic>) to an IL-33/mast cell activation gene expression signature for a Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (KMplot.com)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Remarkably, we found a lower overall survival for intestinal-type gastric cancer patients with high expression of the entire signature (HR = 1.61; logRank <italic>P</italic> = 0.043) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b</xref>). Similar to our IL-33/mast cell activation gene expression signature, a trend for better survival probability was found for high expression of a classical mast cell marker gene signature consisting of <italic>KIT</italic>, <italic>FCER1G</italic>, and <italic>HDC</italic> (encoding Histidine Decarboxylase) (HR = 1.42; logRank <italic>P</italic> = 0.067) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>) as well as for ST2-receptor encoding gene IL1RL1 (HR = 1.57; logRank <italic>P</italic> = 0.049) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7b</xref>). In accordance with our mast cell–macrophage hierarchy model, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis for macrophages revealed a survival disadvantage for intestinal-type gastric cancer patients with high expression of an alternatively activated macrophage gene signature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8c</xref>). On the other hand, high expression of a classically activated gene signature correlates with a higher survival probability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>). Our preclinical data argue strongly for a tumor promoting role of a signaling axis emanating from IL-11-induced, tumor cell-derived IL-33 and the subsequent hierarchical activation cascade of mast cells and tumor-associated macrophages. Collectively, these innate immune cells enable the establishment of the microvasculature required for gastric tumor growth and may provide therapeutically actionable targets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8e</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Kaplan–Meier analysis for an IL-33 - mast cell activation gene expression signature. <bold>a</bold> Expression analysis of genes associated with IL-33 dependent mast cell activation derived from the DERRICO gastric data set (GEO: GSE13911, extracted from oncomine.org) and comparing normal gastric mucosa (<italic>n</italic> = 31) and gastric intestinal-type adenocarcinoma (<italic>n</italic> = 29).

The samples have 163 to 256 million pass filter reads with a base call quality of above 94% of bases with Q30 and above. Reads of the samples were trimmed for adapters and low-quality bases using Trimmomatic software before alignment with the reference genome (Human—hg19) and the annotated transcripts using STAR. The average mapping rate of all samples is 96%. Unique alignment is above 87%. There are 3.74 to 4.07% unmapped reads. The mapping statistics are calculated using Picard software. The samples have 0.59% ribosomal bases. Percent coding bases are between 67–72%. Percent UTR bases are 23–26%, and mRNA bases are between 94–96% for all the samples. Library complexity is measured in terms of unique fragments in the mapped reads using Picard’s MarkDuplicate utility. The samples have 31–52% non-duplicate reads. In addition, the gene expression quantification in raw count format was performed for all samples using STAR/RSEM tools by the annotation of Gencode v19 and normalized by size factor implemented in DESeq2 package. We calculated the fold change gene expression based on FPKM data. We identified deregulated genes with &gt;2 fold cut off and then made the overlap list between two biological repeats. RNA seq data is deposited to GEO (GEO accession number GSE120796).</p>

29765046	        <p id="Par6">Recently, genomic data analysis has been used to uncover previously unknown functions of various genes involved in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We carried out genomic analysis of publicly available gene expression data (GSE13861<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, GSE26899, GSE29272). To screen for genes differentially expressed in GC, we compared normal gastric samples to tumor samples by applying class comparison analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We identified 521 genes as being potentially cancer-associated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Of these genes, we focused on TFs for further analysis as they are the regulatory endpoints of signaling pathways and their deregulation is commonly linked to cancer development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Among the TFs in this gene panel, we selected those that could be potential drug targets. Since nuclear receptors (NRs) possess a ligand-binding pocket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that they would be good candidates in this respect. When genes were ranked according to fold changes between GC and normal gastric samples, ESRRG was one of top-ranked TFs and NRs, exhibiting a greater than 10-fold downregulation in cancer tissues (normal vs. tumor: -14.851 fold in GSE29272; -16.514 fold in GSE26899; -23.608 fold in GSE13861; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref> and b). These results were validated in independent cohorts using western blotting and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). We then focused on elucidating the function of ESRRG in GC. ESRRG is a member of the ESRR nuclear receptor family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, which also includes ESRRA and ESRRB that were found to be predominantly expressed in normal gastric tissues (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a–d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>ESRRG expression in GC patients and in a mouse model. <bold>a</bold> Venn diagram of genes showing significant differential expression between normal and cancer tissue in the three different GC patient cohorts.

29765046	        <p id="Par11">We investigated the mechanisms underlying the ESRRG-mediated suppression of tumor growth.

Since Wnt signaling contributes to oncogenic potential and it is an attractive therapeutic target being currently explored for cancer therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, we investigated the role of ESRRG in regulating the Wnt pathway. First, qRT-PCR was performed to validate the gene expression profiling data, and revealed that Wnt-associated genes such as <italic>DVL3</italic>, <italic>LEF1</italic>, <italic>LGR5</italic>, <italic>TCF7L2</italic>, <italic>AXIN2</italic>, and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> were significantly downregulated in AGS and MKN28 GC cells following ESRRG transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). We next evaluated whether the tumor suppressive properties of ESRRG were due to the suppression of Wnt signaling. Whereas cell growth was reduced by ESRRG overexpression, the ectopic expression of the TCF4/TCF7L2 and LEF1 Wnt effector genes accelerated cell growth in cells with ESRRG overexpression, suggesting that ESRRG-induced growth suppression is reversed by TCF4 and LEF1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>).

29228735	        <p>Since VP has an anti-proliferative effect regardless of YAP1 expression, we investigated other signaling molecules that may be involved in VP inhibition of GC cell proliferation. Thus, we generated gene expression profiles of VP-treated and untreated AGS and MKN-45 GC cell lines to investigate which genes are influenced by VP. Gene expression profiling revealed that expression of 947 genes was significantly altered between the control (untreated) and VP-treated groups of the two cell lines. A Venn diagram of the genes with significantly different expression is shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), which highlights that a substantial number are known downstream targets of VP.

Since FAT1 function in GC is poorly understood, we examined FAT1 expression in GC cell line, mouse model and tumor samples from GC patients. FAT1 was expressed in GC cell lines including normal gastric cell, HFE145 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Using mouse GC model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], we show that FAT1 expression, as determined by western blotting and qRT-PCR, gradually increased during tumorigenesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>), demonstrating that FAT1 has oncogenic potential. Using gene expression profile from gastric cancer patients, we performed genomic analysis. TCGA is the best well known data platform form National Cancer Institute (NCI). TCGA gastric cancer data set was composed of 271 cancer tissues and 25 normal tissues. Gene expression profile reveals that FAT1 expression was up-modulated in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Next, we performed survival analysis correlating FAT1 expression with overall survival duration. We used GEO (Gene expression omnibus) public database. GSE15459, SGE23377 and GSE14210 data set was from gastric cancer patients after surgery and found that patients with tumors highly expressing FAT1 had a worse prognosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2h</xref>).</p>

33349639	        <p id="Par42">Calibration and integration of tumor transcriptomic data: To make their expression values comparable, microarray data sets were corrected by potential sources of technical biases. For doing so, a linear model was fitted to each probeset and data set separately, in order to correct expression values by the center of origin of the sample, batch (scanning day), and probeset differences captured by PM.IQR, RMA.IQR and RNA.DEG metrics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. This correction was carried out using a mixed-effect model in which microsatellite instability (MSI) status was also included as a covariate. Scanning day was modeled as a random effect in these models. Expression intensities were summarized at the gene level (entrez) by the first principal component of the probesets mapping to the same gene. This component was centered and scaled to the weighted mean of the probesets’ means and standard deviations, where the contributions to this first component were used as weights. The sign of this score was then corrected so that it was congruent to the sign of the probeset contributing the most to the first component. TCGA RNA seq expression data were processed in an analogous way; potential biases captured by sample’s center and batch (plate) of origin were corrected using a mixed-effects model for each gene and data set separately. In such models, the center was modeled as a fixed effect while the plate identifier was included as a random effect. The R package lme was used in this procedure. Data sets were merged after quantile normalization and gene-wise standardization (median and median absolute deviation) to the GSE39582 data set according to their distribution of gender, age, site, MSI, and stage, when available. Such standardization was carried out by inverse probability weighting using logistic regression (LogReg) model. For doing so and for each data set D, a LogReg model was carried out on D and GSE39582 that included the aforementioned clinical parameters as predictors of the data set affiliation. Clinical parameters were included in the model as they were informative according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) after running a forward step-wise algorithm for variables selection. Next, conditional probabilities of belonging to data sets D and GSE39582 (Pd and Pr, respectively) were retrieved from the model; then, weights were computed as the ratio of Pd/Pr; finally, weights were truncated to value “five”, in order to avoid the overrepresentation of any sample in the standardization process. Expression values were truncated to the maximum and minimum values observed in this reference data set. Samples with unknown tumor stage information were excluded from the data. As a result, this CRC meta-cohort included a total of 2207 primary tumor samples for analyses.</p>

32291413	        <p id="Par4">To examine <italic>L1CAM</italic> (<italic>L1</italic>) expression patterns in PDAC patients, we used three microarray gene profiling datasets from GEO. GSE62165, representing pancreatic cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 118) and normal pancreas (NP) tissue (<italic>n</italic> = 13), GSE16515, representing pancreatic cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 36) and NP tissue (<italic>n</italic> = 16), and GSE15471, representing pancreatic cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 36) and matching normal pancreatic tissue samples (<italic>n</italic> = 36). In all three dataset, <italic>L1</italic> expression was downregulated in PDAC versus adjacent NP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>L1</italic> expression did not inversely correlate with tumour progression (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1A</xref>), suggesting that <italic>L1</italic> downregulation is an early event. To further analyse a potential link between L1 expression and PDAC, we next performed immunohistochemistry on TMA (tissue microarray) slides composed of 18 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and three NP tissues. L1CAM expression was evaluated in the tumour epithelial compartment. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref> shows representative immunohistochemical (IHC) images of L1 expression in NP and PDAC. L1 expression was classified as 1–4 based on the <italic>H</italic>-score for each PDAC_Grade (form 1–3) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). No association of L1 expression with age and gender was observed. Notably, the TMA also included one pancreatic islet cell tumour that showed high L1 cytoplasmic staining, thereby resembling L1 expression patterns in NP (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1C</xref>). The islet cells may represent an important source for L1 expression that needs to be taking into account when scoring PDAC tissue.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Increased L1CAM expression is associated with favourable outcome in PDAC.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Boxplots showing the differential expression of <italic>L1</italic> in PDAC samples versus normal tissue (NP) in the indicated series of transcriptomic data. *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005 compared with NP. <bold>b</bold> Immunohistochemistry for L1CAM (brown) in tissue sections from normal pancreas (P) and patients with PDAC at G1, G2 and G3 grade. <bold>c</bold>
32291413	        <p id="Par5">We also queried the Human Protein Atlas database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198910-L1CAM/pathology/pancreatic+cancer">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198910-L1CAM/pathology/pancreatic+cancer</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A total of 12 patients with PDAC were classified based on L1 immunohistochemistry for staining intensity and quantity. We observed that ten samples out of 12 showed no L1 staining, whereas the remaining two samples displayed either low or medium levels of L1; five samples presented negative intensity for L1 whereas five samples have L1 weak and two have L1 moderate; the distribution of stained cells showed five samples with 0%, six samples with &lt;25% and one sample with 25–75% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1D</xref>). These results indicated that L1 is expressed at high levels in NP, while its expression is reduced and rather heterogeneous in PDAC. Notably, while we observed in the TCGA database that <italic>L1</italic> gene expression correlated with poor prognosis in PDAC patients (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1B</xref>), differences in survival for patients with low vs. high level of L1 in other GSE dataset (i.e. GSE50827, GSE57495, GSE71727 and GSE62452, data not shown) did not reach statistical significance.</p>
32291413	        <p id="Par19">We examined the mechanism regulating L1CAM expression in PDAC cells. Previous data suggested that L1CAM is directly regulated by TGF-β1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Further analysis of the GSE62165 dataset revealed that <italic>TGF-β1</italic> is highly expressed in PDAC compared with NP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>) and its expression is inversely correlated with <italic>L1</italic> expression in both GSE62165 and GSE15471 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that in patients with poor prognosis, due to high levels of <italic>TGF-β1</italic> expression, <italic>L1CAM</italic> will be suppressed, resulting in unleashed stemness and consequently enhanced resistance to conventional chemotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we treated L3.6pl, #253 and #354 with recombinant TGF-β1 (rTGF-β1) protein in the presence or absence of the TGFβRI inhibitor A-83–01 for 7 days. By qPCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5F</xref>) and flow cytometry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5F</xref>) we demonstrate a significant downregulation of L1CAM upon treatment with rTGF-β1, which was in part rescued by co-treatment with A-83–01. We also observed by qPCR an increase of stemness genes (i.e. <italic>CD44</italic>, <italic>CD133</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic>) in rTGF-β1-treated cells, which was again rescued by A-83–01 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5G</xref>). Notably, rTGF-β1 induced p(CAGA)<sub>12</sub> in L3.6pl cells, a reporter previously shown to be specifically activated by SMAD4 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5H</xref>). In addition, rTGF-β1 induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of SMAD2 and completely abrogated by co-treatment with A-83–01 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">5I</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>PSC-derived TGF-β1 negatively regulates L1CAM expression.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Boxplots showing the differential expression of <italic>TGF-β1</italic> in PDAC samples versus normal tissue (NP) in the indicated series of transcriptomic data. ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005 compared with NP. <bold>b</bold> Inverse correlation between <italic>TGF-β1</italic> and <italic>L1</italic> in PDAC samples in the indicated series of transcriptomic data.

26844272	        <p>To assess to what extent the prognostic value of the <italic>BCL9</italic>/<italic>9L</italic>-KO signature could be attributed to biologic functions, a wide array of published gene sets relating to intestinal WNT targets, stemness, EMT, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ec0020">Table S3</xref>) was assessed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0240">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) for enrichment in the transcriptomes of <italic>BCL9</italic>/<italic>9L</italic>-KO tumors. Each gene set was assessed individually as exemplified in the two insets, given a score after normalization for the size of the relevant set, and the scores represented as a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>). Unambiguously, all examined WNT- stemness-, and EMT-related gene sets were negatively enriched, while differentiation-related sets were positively enriched within the transcriptomes of knockout tumors. Remarkably, consistent enrichment scores were observed across the three mouse CRC datasets, i.e. the new RNA sequencing sets from AOM/DSS and <italic>Apc</italic>/<italic>Kras</italic> tumors, and our previously reported Affymetrix microarray data set from DMH/DSS tumors (GSE21576) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0065">Deka et al., 2010</xref>).See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref></p>

(A) AOM/DSS tumors derived from constitutively <italic>Bcl9</italic>/<italic>9l</italic>-null as compared to wild-type gastrointestinal epithelium displayed highly reproducible gene expression changes involving genes associated with WNT signaling, stemness traits and EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0065">Deka et al., 2010</xref>). Herein, genes with the strongest down-regulation in constitutively <italic>Bcl9</italic>/<italic>9l</italic>-ablated tumors were assembled into WNT-, stemness- and EMT-core signatures (WNT/stemness/EMT reference genes) that served as a reference for quantitation by qRT-PCR.

(B) <italic>Apc</italic>/<italic>Kras</italic> tumors lacking <italic>Bcl9</italic>/<italic>9l</italic> showed a significant down-regulation of 13 out of 18 WNT/stemness/EMT reference genes, thereby largely phenocopying the gene signature shift observed in the AOM/DSS CRC model (Fig. S1A).

32415208	        <p id="Par8">We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on bulk tumors (four tumors from each group) to identify transcripts differentially expressed between doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant tumors. We used the 441 most differentially expressed genes (fold change (FC) cut-off = 1.75, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>) to create a doxorubicin resistance gene signature (DoxoR-GS). We then tested its clinical relevance using gene expression profiling datasets of chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients (for details, see “Methods” section)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients from GSE58812<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> that have high DoxoR-GS scores exhibit poor overall survival (OS) as compared to those with low DoxoR-GS scores (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). These results were further confirmed using METABRIC dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>) and in another dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE31519">GSE31519</ext-link>) where we showed that expression of DoxoR-GS is significantly higher in patients who exhibit an event, described as either relapse- or distant metastasis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>).</p>
32415208	        <p id="Par10">Based on the RNA-seq analysis of our doxorubicin-resistant models, three integrin genes, <italic>ITGA5</italic>, <italic>ITGA10</italic> and <italic>ITGB5</italic> were significantly (FC cut-off = 1.5, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) upregulated in resistant tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). We found that higher expression of only the integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5), but not that of ITGA10 or ITGB5, is associated with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) in chemotherapy-treated basal patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>, i and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1d, e</xref>). No such relationship was observed in patients with basal subtype of breast cancer who were not treated with chemotherapy or in patients with other subtypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i</xref>). As around 70% of TNBCs are basal subtype, and 76% of basal subtype are TNBCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, we classified patients also as TNBC using ERα, PR, and HER2 expression and again observed a strong association between ITGA5 expression and RFS in chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). Importantly, we also detected a significant upregulation of fibronectin (FN1), the main ligand for ITGA5, in doxorubicin-resistant tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1j</xref>) and a significant association between high FN1 expression and poorer RFS in chemotherapy-treated basal patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1k, l</xref>). These results were further validated with another TNBC patient dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58812">GSE58812</ext-link>) in which higher expression of either ITGA5 or FN1 is significantly associated with worse overall survival for the chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). Notably, when the patients are stratified based on ITGA5 and FN1 expressions in combination, a stronger separation of overall survival was achieved (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0008; HR = 5.28). Altogether, these data suggest that deregulation of FN1-ITGA5 signaling could be a major driver of chemoresistance in TNBC.</p>
32415208	        <p id="Par11">Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), encoded by the <italic>HIF1A</italic> gene, activates the transcription of several ECM-remodeling enzymes, including collagen prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases and lysyl oxidases thereby modulating ECM stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Importantly, our IPA analysis revealed a significant enrichment of HIF1A signaling in the doxorubicin-resistant tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). Given the involvement of hypoxia in ECM remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that HIF-1α could activate integrin and focal adhesion signaling. We first validated activation of the hypoxic response in chemoresistant tumors by demonstrating upregulation of the CA9 gene, which is a direct HIF-1α target gene and a well-established hypoxia marker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. CA9 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in resistant tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). The induction of hypoxia signaling in the resistant tumors was not simply a result of an increase in tumor size, as there was no enrichment of hypoxia signaling in vehicle-treated tumors that are the largest in size vs. sensitive tumors (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Furthermore, patients having high DoxoR-GS score also express high levels of hypoxia-related genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Hypoxia-induced LOX hyperactivates ITGA5/FN1/FAK/Src axis in TNBCs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Expression of a HIF-1α direct target gene, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) in sensitive (<italic>n</italic> = 3) vs. resistant (<italic>n</italic> = 3) tumors at mRNA (left) and protein (right) levels, demonstrating predominantly membranous and mild cytoplasmic staining. <bold>b</bold> Genes upregulated upon hypoxia are enriched in patients with high DoxoR-GS score from GSE58812 (<italic>n</italic> = 106). <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>. % growth inhibition upon doxorubicin treatment of MDA-MB-231 (<bold>c</bold>) (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and MDA-MB-157 (<bold>d</bold>) (<italic>n</italic> = 4) cells grown under normoxic vs. hypoxic conditions. <bold>e</bold> Expression of LOX in sensitive (<italic>n</italic> = 12) vs. resistant (<italic>n</italic> = 9) tumors at mRNA (left) and protein (right) levels, demonstrating strong cytoplasmic and weak nuclear staining. <bold>f</bold>, <bold>g</bold> Representative images of Picrosirius red staining (<bold>f</bold>) and its quantification (<bold>g</bold>) (<italic>n</italic> = 6). <bold>h</bold> Heatmap summarizing the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between <italic>HIF1A</italic> and <italic>LOX</italic>, <italic>ITGA5</italic> or <italic>FN1</italic> and between <italic>LOX</italic> and <italic>ITGA5</italic> or <italic>FN1</italic> in breast cancer patients.

32415208	        <p id="Par12">To experimentally demonstrate the acquisition of doxorubicin resistance under hypoxic conditions, we cultured MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells in normoxic vs. hypoxic conditions in the presence of increasing concentrations of doxorubicin. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, d</xref>, cells became less sensitive to growth inhibition induced by doxorubicin when grown under hypoxic conditions. Next, we performed Upstream Regulator analysis in IPA and found that 28 of 39 HIF-1α target genes had an expression direction consistent with the activation of HIF-1α (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Among the actively transcribed genes upon HIF-1α activation during chemoresistance, we identified LOX, which is known to modulate ECM stiffness via collagen cross-linking and promote metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Upregulation of LOX in doxorubicin-resistant xenografts was validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). While LOX, ITGA5, and FN1 mRNAs were upregulated between sensitive and resistant tumors under doxorubicin treatment, the fast-growing vehicle-treated tumors showed no upregulation of these genes, suggesting that their upregulation is specific to chemotherapy resistance (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrated increased fibrillar collagen in resistant tumors compared to sensitive counterparts by picrosirius red staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f, g</xref>). We then examined gene expression from 9 different breast cancer datasets and found correlation between <italic>HIF1A</italic> and <italic>LOX</italic>, <italic>ITGA5</italic>, and <italic>FN1</italic> mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h</xref>), supporting the upstream regulatory role of HIF1A in their transcription. Strikingly, the correlation of <italic>LOX</italic> with <italic>ITGA5</italic> and <italic>FN1</italic> mRNAs was the strongest among all pairs, even stronger than the correlation of these three genes with <italic>HIF1A</italic>. This suggested that hypoxia-induced LOX might specifically be regulating <italic>ITGA5</italic> and <italic>FN1</italic> expression, and the subsequent activation of intracellular downstream signaling could be contributing to doxorubicin resistance. Consistent with this, we detected a significant enrichment of hypoxia and focal adhesion signaling gene sets in tumors with high LOX expression (GSE58812<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a, b</xref>).</p>
32415208	        <p id="Par14">To determine the clinical relevance of LOX expression in chemotherapy-treated TNBCs, we performed survival analyses and observed that higher <italic>LOX</italic> mRNA expression predicts poor RFS only in chemotherapy-treated basal breast cancer patients, but not in other breast cancer subtypes or in untreated cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2o</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). Furthermore, in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE31519">GSE31519</ext-link> dataset we observed that more than half of the patients that exhibit event, described as either a relapse or distant metastasis, express higher LOX levels (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.012) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>). Similarly, in another dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE25066">GSE25066</ext-link>), we observed that a significantly higher proportion of chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients with residual disease (RD) express higher levels of LOX (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.011) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>). Furthermore, TNBC patients with RD express significantly higher levels of LOX, ITGA5 and FN1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5c–e</xref>). Importantly, we stained for LOX protein expression in tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2p</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). In 77 TNBC patients treated with chemotherapy, we showed that higher LOX protein levels were significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS) (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.019, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2q</xref>). Although other LOX family members (LOXL1-4) have also been reported to be regulated by HIF-1α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, none of them were significantly altered in doxorubicin-resistant xenografts (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>). Altogether, these data are consistent with a model in which hypoxia-induced LOX activates integrin signaling by upregulating ITGA5 and FN1, leading to poor survival and chemoresistance in TNBC patients.</p>
32415208	        <p id="Par23">To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of the coordinated activation of the HIF1A/LOX/ITGA5 axis under hypoxia, we sought for a common modulator. As miRNAs tend to function in a pathway-centric manner by targeting multiple genes in the same cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, we searched for a potential miRNA modulator of HIF1A/LOX/ITGA5-mediated chemotherapy resistance. We examined all conserved miRNAs targeting <italic>HIF1A</italic>, <italic>LOX</italic>, and <italic>ITGA5</italic> and found eight common miRNAs having binding sites in the 3′-UTRs of these three genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). Out of these eight miRNAs, only two miRNAs, miR-142-3p, and miR-128-3p, showed an inverse correlation with HIF1A signature, and LOX and ITGA5 expression in basal subtype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">12a–c</xref>). One of these two miRNAs, miR-142-3p, showed a significant association with OS specifically in chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">12d</xref>). Furthermore, miR-142-3p was significantly downregulated in doxorubicin-resistant xenografts that we developed in vivo as compared to sensitive ones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>). Importantly, induction of hypoxia inhibited the expression of miR-142-3p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7f</xref>), while silencing HIF1A upregulated miR-142-3p expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7g</xref>), suggesting that hypoxia-mediated downregulation of miR-142-3p potentially involves HIF1A.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>miR-142-3p regulates HIF1A/LOX/ITGA5 axis to confer chemosensitization in TNBC.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Venn diagram of combinatorial target prediction analysis.

Through amplicon mapping, we identified the smallest amplified region to be 97.5–103.3 Mb on chromosome 8 containing 28 annotated genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="path5274-fig-0001">1</xref>B; see supplementary material, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="path5274-supitem-0004">S2</xref>). In addition to some RNA‐processing genes, <italic>YWHAZ</italic> was revealed to be the most cancer‐related gene in the 8q22.3 amplicon. Dual‐color FISH confirmed the existence of <italic>YWHAZ</italic> gain or amplification in UCUBs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="path5274-fig-0001">1</xref>C), especially advanced‐stage cancers (T2–T4) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) with lymph node invasion (<italic>p</italic> = 0.027) and higher mitotic activity (HPF ≥ 10) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="path5274-tbl-0001">1</xref>). SNP array data of the study cohort from Dana‐Faber Cancer Institute (GSE39282) containing 16 NMIBCs and 98 MIBCs were utilized to validate our data, and it confirmed a tendency toward <italic>YWHAZ</italic> genetic gain/amplification in MIBCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="path5274-fig-0001">1</xref>D, <italic>p</italic> = 0.047).

30945298	<italic>YWHAZ</italic> amplification/genetic gain is more frequently detected in MIBC. (A) Genetic alterations in 60 UCUB samples (20 at stage Ta‐T1, 10 at stage T2, 17 at stage T3, and 13 at stage T4) and 2 cell lines were determined using 250K SNP arrays. The SNP values on chromosome 8 were normalized to the average data from 10 samples of normal urothelium and are shown in a heatmap alone with genetic loci on the chromosome. (B) The minimal 8q22.3 amplicon was mapped to 97.5–103.3 Mb by overlapping amplified regions (with copy numbers &gt;2.5) in UCUBs. (C) Dual‐color FISH was performed on UCUB tissue blocks. Red signals (RP11‐102K7) indicate the 8q22.3 amplicon region, while green signals (RP11‐327O12) indicate the control region on chromosome 8, with genetic copy numbers near 2.0.

For the Lin dataset, one new NEPC PDX microarray data (LTL545) was added to increase statistical power. SCLC cell lines from CCLE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home">https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home</ext-link>) were used as NE type and NSCLC cell lines as non-NE type lung cancers. Neuroblastoma cell lines from CCLE were used as NE type and glioma as non-NE type nervous system tumors. RNA-Seq data of corresponding cell lines were retrieved from CCLE to identify genes up-regulated in NE-type compared with non-NE type cancers. Wilcoxon test was used to calculate p-value in every comparison and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was conducted to assess the false discovery rates (FDR) of multiple comparisons. Genes co-up-regulated (fold change &gt;2 and FDR &lt; 0.05) in NE vs. non-NE comparisons of all the four data sets were subjected to the following network analysis. For the network analysis, Pearson correlations were calculated between the co-up-regulated 9 TFs and 84 non-TF genes using their expression data in CCLE SCLC, CCEL neuroblastoma and Beltran NEPC data sets. Pearson correlations between the 10 TFs were also added to the network. Correlation count was defined by <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.5 in one dataset.

31350286	        <p>Tumours were extracted and immediately flash-frozen. RNA from xenograft tissue was harvested using the RNeasy Plus Universal Kit (Cat# 73404, Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was sent to the Princess Margaret Genomics Centre and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500 for an average of 40 M reads per xenograft growth. Fastq files were filtered using Xenome in order to filter out mouse contamination. Only reads mapping exclusively to the mouse reference were filtered out. The remaining reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) and read counts estimated using STAR. Expressed genes were defined as requiring at least 10 reads in at least two samples. Read counts were upper quantile normalised. Finally, EBSeq was used to test for differential expression between experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DMM038083C15">Leng et al., 2013</xref>). Genes were determined to be differentially expressed given a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.05.

33205026	        <p id="p0085">Several studies have revealed that, in patient tumors, the ECM has a unique composition and in accordance with the “seed and soil hypothesis” emphasized the tumor microenvironment, including ECM composition, as a main contributor to tumor progression and drug response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Naba et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Romero-López et al. highlighted the importance of recapitulating ECM composition as a vital aspect of tissue physiology by comparing ECM from normal human colon and colon tumor that had metastasized to liver; they found significant differences in protein composition, stiffness, and vascular network formation between normal and metastatic colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Romero-Lopez et al., 2017</xref>). Recent introduction of the tissue de-cellularization technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ott et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crapo et al., 2011</xref>), by which cells are removed while retaining the ECM structure and composition, is a substantial step forward in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The advantage of this model compared with the other natural and synthetic 3D matrices is that the native structural proteins and soluble factors are largely preserved in the decellularized scaffold, resulting in a more comprehensive tissue recapitulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pinto et al., 2017</xref>). Piccoli et al. developed a technique to decellularize colorectal cancer tissue biopsies and generate a 3D “bioactive” model while maintaining the ultrastructural environment and biological activity of the native tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Piccoli et al., 2018</xref>). In another study, patient-derived tissue-specific decellularized ECM was introduced as a 3D culture system that recapitulated colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) to study CRLM progression and response to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">D'Angelo et al., 2020b</xref>). Overall, the best model to recapitulate human CRC metastases remains patient-derived scaffolds. Our team has previously used decellularized human colonic tissue to model the process of intravasation and has discovered that, during intravasation, gene signatures emerge that are unique to the

GEO Dataset GSE3744 contains expression data using the Affymetrix U133+2.0 for clinical samples classified as basal-like and non-basal-like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0115">[23]</xref>. This dataset was analyzed using the NCBI curated dataset browser tool. The TCGA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0120">[24]</xref> dataset was accessed <italic>via</italic> cBioPortal and analyzed using R.</p>
25622905	        <p id="p0080">To expand our findings beyond our <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems we sought to further examine the regulation of EGFR and Mig6 in clinical BC samples. Therefore, we analyzed the TCGA BC dataset for the expression relationship between EGFR and Mig6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0120">[24]</xref>. Consistent with our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0020">Figure 4</xref>, there was a significant direct correlation between EGFR and Mig6 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figure 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). Next, we analyzed the GEO data set GSE3744 in which patient BCs are classified as basal like and non-basal like as characterized by microarray analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0115">[23]</xref>. Consistent with EGFR being a major defining factor of basal-like BC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0135">[27]</xref> and there being a direct correlation between EGFR and Mig6, Mig6 expression was significantly higher in this more aggressive subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figure 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). Finally, we analyzed the cell line encyclopedia (CCLE) to establish the ratio of Mig6 to EGFR across the 58 available BC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figure 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). This analysis indicated that similar to the clinical datasets there is a robust direct relationship between Mig6 and EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figure 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). Two basal-like cell lines, the MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) and the EGFR-amplified MDA-MB-468 (MDA-468) cells expressed the second highest and lowest Mig6/EGFR expression ratio, respectively. In contrast to the MDA-231 cells, EGF stimulation of the MDA-468 cells is known to induce apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0070">[14]</xref>. Along these lines, EGF stimulation results in a progressive decrease in [<sup>3</sup>H]Thymidine incorporation in the MDA-468 cells, but not in the MDA-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figure 5</xref><italic>D</italic>). In an attempt to manipulate the Mig6/EGFR ratio in the MDA-231 cells we overexpressed EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figure 5</xref><italic>E</italic>). However, consistent with all of the correlative data above, recombinant overexpression of EGFR in the MDA-231 cells lead to a concomitant increase in Mig6 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figure 5</xref><italic>E</italic>). These data support our conclusion that there is a direct relationship between expression levels of EGFR and Mig6 in metastatic BC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figure 5</xref><italic>E</italic>). Finally, outgrowth of the MDA-231 cells under 3D pulmonary organotypic conditions confirmed an antitumorigenic effect of EGF in these metastatic BC cells, a result that was significantly enhanced upon overexpression of EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figure 5</xref><italic>F</italic>).<fig id="f0025"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Expression of Mig6 and EGFR are directly related and required at a balanced ratio for basal-like BC survival in response to EGF.

31432603	        <p>Total RNA of PDX and SRT was extracted using Nucleo Spin RNA kits (Takara Bio). Each total RNA sample (0.5 μg), extracted from six paired samples of PDX and SRT, was converted into a RNA‐seq library of template molecules suitable for subsequent cluster generation using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v. 2 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The first step was purifying the poly‐A‐containing mRNA molecules using poly‐T oligo‐attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA was fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations at elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments were copied into first‐strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. This was followed by second‐strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase I and RNase H. These cDNA fragments then go through an end repair process, the addition of a single ‘A’ base, and then ligation of the adapters. Next, the products are purified and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA library. The result of the fragmentation step is an RNA‐seq library that includes inserts that range in peak size from 368 bp to 405 bp. The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina). Sequencing of TruSeq RNA libraries (paired‐end 2 × 101 bp reads) generated approximately 50 000 000 (47 467 804‐56 123 818) reads for each sample.

33323965	      <p id="Par9">Subsequently, we explored the functional role of G9a HMTase activity in CCSC populations from patient-derived tumor samples (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">4A</xref>). Using a serial organoid formation assay, we tested the potential of G9a inhibition to affect the tumor-initiating capacity of primary CCSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>). CCSC populations were enriched through formation spheroids in suspension, as marked by the large proportion of CD133<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>+</sup> cells, comparable to the CSC-like HT29 cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This was supported by the enrichment of LGR5 expression in patient-derived spheroids vs. bulk 3D organoids resulting from single-cell seeding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. By opposition to spheroids, 3D organoids were described as mini tumors maintaining primary patient tumor heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed reduced levels of the differentiation marker DPP4, along with a clear enrichment of G9a expression in patient-derived spheroids vs. bulk organoids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). G9a inhibition in a primary series of patient-derived 3D organoids resulted in a significant decrease of organoid size and frequency compared to vehicle-treated groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D</xref> and Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">4B, C</xref>). Residual primary organoids were dissociated and re-seeded in a secondary series. Importantly, no further drug treatments were performed on this secondary series of patient-derived 3D organoids, enabling bona fide assessment of persisting tumor-initiating cell populations in samples previously treated with a G9a inhibitor (vs. vehicle control) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>). Thus, BIX and UNC0642-treated primary organoids had lower tumor-initiating capacity when plated in a secondary assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4E</xref>, and Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">4C, D</xref>). Induction of H3K9me2 deposition in HIEC cells was insufficient to confer them with organoid formation capacity (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">4C</xref>). Mechanistically, we searched for potential pathways involved in G9a-mediated maintenance of CSCs in CRC patient samples. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) data set revealed that G9a and H3K9me2 are significantly co-enriched at 1392 genomic regions (1 kb) in patient-derived CCSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4F</xref>, Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">4E</xref>, and Table-S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A majority of the 968 annotated co-enriched sites were mapped in introns (422) and distal intergenic regions (680) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4F</xref>, Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">4F</xref>, and Table-S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">4</xref>). This is consistent with our MeDIP observations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2E</xref>, and Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">2E</xref>), considering that LINE1 elements are observed at a high frequency within intronic and intergenic space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, we performed an integrative analysis of transcriptionally silenced genes in CSC-like HT29 cells vs. normal HIECs (RNA-seq, Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">4G</xref>) that are simultaneously enriched/co-occupied with G9a and H3K9me2 in patient-derived CCSCs (ChIP-seq) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4F</xref>). We identified a list of 183 annotated entities presenting those criteria, which we used to perform gene ontology analysis (Table-S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">5</xref> and S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM11">6</xref>). Genes putatively silenced by G9a in CCSCs were associated with processes such as regulation of development and cell differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4G</xref>, Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">4H</xref>, Table-S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">7</xref>). Moreover, multiple genes involved in negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling (GO:0030178), repression of epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (Onder E-cadherin targets up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and extracellular matrix organization (GO:0031012) were silenced in CRC (vs. normal) and co-enriched with G9a and H3K9me2 in patient-derived CCSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4H</xref>, Table-S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">7</xref> and S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">8</xref>).

30211160	        <p>Earlier studies in a rat PaC model unraveled a striking decrease in MET, HAS3, HGF, HSP1, and MMP9 and a significant decrease in uPAR, CD104, PGK1 and thrombospondin (TSP) in CD44v6kd-TEX (Jung et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B132">2011</xref>). While decreased recovery of MET, HGF, MMP9, uPAR and CD104 corresponds to the reduced recovery in CD44v6kd cells and likely is due to the association of these molecules with CD44v6 and/or the engagement of CD44v6 in transcription or stabilization, some non-TEM proteins, e.g., AnnII, HSP1, Monooxygenase activating protein and PGK1, are also affected, which pointed toward an engagement of CD44v6 in vesicle loading. Repeating the experiment with human CIC-TEX and CD44v6kd TEX evaluating exclusively proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with CD44s or CD44v6 confirmed these results and provided evidence for an unexpectedly high number of CD44v6-coimmunoprecipitating molecules engaged in RNA splicing, processing, transport as well as of Dicer and PRKRA (protein activator of interferon induced protein kinase EIF2AK2) engaged in mRNA silencing (deposited: Functional Proteome Analysis, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany, File: ZW2612) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), strengthening the hypothesis on the CD44v6 engagement in mRNA processing. The finding is in line with Exo harboring the mRNA processing machinery and the recovery of miRNA and mRNA processing complexes in TEX (Melo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B200">2014</xref>; Geis-Asteggiante et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">2018</xref>). Notably, loading of the vesicles with mRNA processing proteins was CD44v6-specific, not being seen, e.g., in CIC-TEX selected according to Tspan8 expression (ENA database, accession No: PRJEB25446). The mechanism accounting for the selective CD44v6-dependent recruitment remains to be explored.</p>
30211160	        <p>Besides loading with proteins, the recruitment of miRNA and lncRNA has been extensively explored and is well-summarized in recent reviews (Hewson and Morris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">2016</xref>; Bortoluzzi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2017</xref>; Fan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2018</xref>; Salehi and Sharifi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B268">2018</xref>), some miRNA being preferentially recruited via CD44v6 (accession No: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE34739">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE34739</ext-link>, ENA database, accession No: PRJEB25446). Thus, non-stochastic miRNA-loading into tetraspanin-positive ILV proceeds preferentially via a ceramide-dependent pathway. Oncogenes such as Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog also promote selective miRNA packaging into ILV. The transfer of selectively recruited lncRNA, adds to tumor progression and EMT induction. Of particular interest for CD44 could be MALAT1 that modifies RNA alternate splicing (rev. in Hewson and Morris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">2016</xref>).</p>

31097715	        <p id="Par9">Compared to the individual treatments, the Combi treatment reinforced the downregulation of NGFR, NPM1, HIST13H, JUN, and PLA2G4C in a possible additive manner (Suppl. Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Considering the upregulated genes in Combi, we found a remarkable higher frequency of potentially synergistic effects detectable for SPP1, EGF, SPRY1, and IGFBP3. In case of the FGF signaling antagonist SPRY1 and the metastasis suppressor gene IGFBP3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, it seems to be an inhibition of an oncogenic pathway whereas the upregulation of the two secreted factors SPP1 and EGF seems to be an undesired side effect of treatment reinforcing the PI3K signaling. Nevertheless, we identified a specific gene target panel whose expression was altered by Combi treatment including genes, such as FST, PLA2G10, NGF, PAK7 DNMT1, and BIRC3. Although many genes were deregulated in same direction as observed for the single treatments, we provide evidence that the combination treatment also targets a characteristic gene profile (Suppl. Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Next, in a scatter plot, we confirmed dissimilarities among SARB and Combi-treated samples, especially in the downregulated genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Gene expression profiling identifies WNT/ß-Catenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways as the major targets of SARB hybrid treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plot of the whole NanoString gene set of HCT116 cells after 24 h of treatment with Combi and SARB hybrid.

31097715	        <p id="Par17">We next used the public GEO database (GSE34053<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>) to extract specific gene expression profiles of CD133+ and CD133− colorectal tumor cells. When matching the gene panel of GSE34053 with our NanoString panel, we could acquire 77 genes that were included in both setups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4F</xref>). We hypothesized that the gene signature after SARB treatment might resemble the gene signature of the CD133− population. From the 77 common genes, 27 genes were overlapping with the downregulated genes in the CD133− population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4G</xref>). Four of these 27 genes were significantly downregulated also in SARB and included the oncogene KRAS, the membranous protein kinase PRKAR2B, which is known to regulate the MAP2 kinase, the receptor for fibronectin ITGB8 and PROM1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4J</xref>). From this panel, only two genes were significantly downregulated in Combi. A similar result was achieved when comparing upregulated genes in CD133− and HCT116 cells under SARB exposure with four genes, including inhibitor of angiogenesis THBS1 and PDGFD, which plays an important role in wound healing by macrophage recruitment, calcium channel protein CACNB2, and SOCS3, an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4j</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the two combination modalities, Combi and SARB treatments, might provide a selective advantage against CD133-enriched tumor populations. To study this, we analyzed CD133-enriched HCT116 clones derived from spheroids by single cell dilution strategy as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4H</xref>).

To explore a direct role for AR in the regulation of these genes, we assessed their response to AR activation by DHT and AR inhibition by ENZA treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a, b</xref>). <italic>HECTD4</italic> and <italic>TRIM49</italic> did not behave as AR target genes, while <italic>MYCBP2</italic> behaved like an AR stimulated target gene. Hence, these results did not recapitulate the expression profile seen upon EPZ treatment. We next examined the role of MYC in regulating the E3 ligases, including in the context of AR inhibition. Remarkably, depletion of MYC by siRNA in LNCaP cells resulted in upregulation of <italic>HECTD4</italic> and <italic>MYCBP2</italic> both in the presence and absence of AR inhibitor ENZA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). <italic>TRIM49</italic> was upregulated upon MYC knockdown but suppressed in the presence of ENZA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6c</xref>). The expression changes in <italic>HECTD4, MYCBP2</italic>, and <italic>TRIM49</italic> observed upon concomitant MYC and AR inhibition in these experiments are remarkably similar to the changes seen after EPZ treatment. In AR-negative PC3 cells, MYC knockdown led to upregulation of <italic>HECTD4</italic> and <italic>MYCBP2</italic> and downregulation of <italic>TRIM49</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6d</xref>). Hence, <italic>HECTD4</italic> and <italic>MYCBP2</italic> are potential MYC repressed targets. We assessed if <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>DOT1L</italic> expression were correlated with the expression of <italic>MYCBP2</italic> and <italic>HECTD4</italic> in clinical datasets. However, we were unable to determine significant trends possibly due to the effects of other E3 ligase targets and the indirect nature of the regulation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6e</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>MYC loss induces expression of <italic>HECTD4</italic> and <italic>MYCBP2</italic>.</title><p><bold>a</bold> mRNA expression of <italic>HECTD4, MYCBP2</italic> in LNCaP cells transfected with Control or MYC targeting siRNA (2 days) followed by treatment with Vehicle or 20 μM ENZA (2 days). <bold>b</bold> mRNA expression of <italic>HECTD4, MYCBP2</italic> and <italic>TRIM49</italic> in PC3 cells transfected with Control or MYC targeting siRNA for 2 days. <bold>c</bold> MYC ChIP followed by qPCR in LNCaP cells at the promoters of the indicated genes. <bold>d</bold> MYC ChIP-seq plots in LNCaP cells (GSE73994) at the indicated genes.

On the following day, the cells were transferred to a 24-well plate preloaded with cover glasses. On the third day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 5 μM HaloTag TMR Ligand at 37℃ for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS 3 times and incubated in 150 nM MitoTracker™ Green FM (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Cells were then washed again with PBS 3 times and incubated in 5μg/ml Hoechst33342 dye for 15 min with final 3 washes with PBS. The cover glasses were taken out and observed under a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). To detect the sub-localization of ANKRD22 in organoid-cultured cells, SW620 and RKO cells overexpressing Halo-ANKRD22 fusion protein were cultured in Matrigel matrix for 7 days.

29694894	        <p id="P7">Considering the importance of miRNAs in intestinal carcinogenesis, we explored whether the loss of PKCζ may lead to changes in the miRNA expression profile of CRC cells. To this effect, SW480 human CRC cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing short hairpin non-targeting (shNT) or shRNA selective for PKCζ (shPKCζ), and microarrays were used to create global gene-expression profiles of both mRNAs and miRNAs (GEO: GSE42186; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). From this analysis, we found a list of 74 miRNAs that significantly changed in shPKCζ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In parallel, we also analyzed the mRNA expression levels of shNT and shPKCζ cells and performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the “C3 miRNA target motifs” gene set compilation to predict which miRNAs were active/inactive based on 3<sup>′</sup> UTR miRNA-binding motifs present in mRNAs that were differentially expressed in shPKCζ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1A</xref>). To select the most biologically relevant miRNAs altered by PKCζ loss, we crossed these data with a profile of human miRNAs that were significantly changed in CRC patients with low <italic>PRKCZ</italic> mRNA expression as compared to those with high <italic>PRKCZ</italic> levels. To do that, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas network colon adenocarcinoma dataset (TCGA-COAD) and selected patients in the top and bottom 25% of <italic>PRKCZ</italic> mRNA expression levels. We then identified the miRNAs and mRNAs that were significantly altered in both groups and subjected them to GSEA using the “C3 miRNA target motifs” gene matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S1A</xref>). Finally, we crossed the results from the analysis of the miRNA profile in shPKCζ cells with those of the human TCGA-COAD, which converged in the identification of miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-429 as the most relevant miRNAs significantly downregulated under conditions of PKCζ deficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1B</xref>). The miRNAs identified in our unbiased approach are part of the miR-200 family, which consists of five evolutionarily conserved miRNAs (miR-200b, miR-200a, miR-429, miR-200c, and miR-141) that are localized in two polycistronic clusters: <italic>miR-200b/200a/429</italic> on chromosome 1, and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> on chromosome 12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1C</xref>). They share a high degree of sequence homology, with a difference of only 1 nt in their seed sequence: miR-141/200a (seed AACACUG) and miR-200b/200c/429 (seed AAUACUG). Importantly, the miR-200 family members have been described as key players in mediating stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that reportedly facilitate tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Wellner et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, we focused our efforts on this subset of miRNAs.</p>

Biologically speaking, <italic>P2rX7</italic> gene and <italic>Nt5e</italic> gene expressions could change the character of cells in AKTP organoids. If they enhance cell proliferation, cell number in each organoid should be increased. On the other hand, if <italic>P2rX7</italic> and <italic>Nt5e</italic> expressions affect cell–cell adhesion, such as induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) etc., the cell number in each organoid could be decreased. Basically, this experiment aimed to test the cell count differences between AKTP-P2rX7 organoids and AKTP organoids, and AKTP-Nt5e organoids and AKTP organoids using microscopic images generated from these three conditions. To do this, the AKTP organoids were cultured from the small intestine of a <italic>APC∆716/KRasG12D/TgfbrII KO/p53R270H</italic> colorectal cancer mouse model according to the standard protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-cells-08-01019">21</xref>]. To overexpress <italic>P2rx7</italic> and <italic>Nt5e</italic>, we cloned mouse <italic>P2rx7</italic> or <italic>Nt5e</italic> genes into a mammalian expression vector which has a constitutive active promoter. We then introduced those plasmids into AKTP organoids and established two sets of organoids, making three different groups defined as AKTP, AKTP-P2rX7, and AKTP-Nt5e. To image them, these three groups of organoids were collected from Matrigel with cell recovery solution (Corning, NY, USA) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich, 158127) for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclei were then stained with Hoechst33342 (ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) for 10 min at room temperature. The stained organoids were placed onto glass slides and cover slipped using a mounting medium (Vectashield Laboratories (Burlingame, CA, USA. H-1000). To make the 3D organoids become 2D, we pressed the cover slip carefully before sealing it. After all the preparation processing, the slides were flatbed and scanned using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzler, Germany). The view fields were digitized at 20× magnification (20× objective) and images were processed using Leica Application Suite X software (Leica Microsystems). To reduce noise, an average image was taken from two images. We did not take Z-stacks, as organoids were 2D on the glass slides. Therefore, each image contained all nuclei in an organoid. In total, we gathered 164 images for the AKTP group, 107 images for the AKTP-P2rX7 group, and 114 images for the AKTP-Nt5e group from the experiment. These images had a resolution of 512 × 512, so we resized them to the resolution of 256 × 256 to make them the same resolution as the datasets used in the training models.</p>

Survival analysis in this dataset revealed that high BCL-3 expression was linked to significantly reduced survival when adjusted for tumour stage. To examine the role of BCL-3 in Wnt/β-catenin signalling, we first screened a panel of human adenoma- and carcinoma-derived cell lines for expression of BCL-3 and β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DMM037697F1">Fig. 1</xref>B). Results show that both adenoma- and carcinoma-derived cell lines express β-catenin and BCL-3 protein, although there is an apparent inverse correlation between β-catenin and BCL-3 protein levels (those cells with lowest β-catenin generally having higher levels of BCL-3). To determine whether BCL-3 is regulated by β-catenin expression, LS174T cells with a doxycycline-inducible shRNA targeted towards β-catenin (sh-β-catenin; a kind gift from Professor Hans Clevers, Hubrecht Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands) were used to suppress β-catenin expression. LS174T/R1 control cells were transfected with an otherwise identical plasmid, which expressed a non-targeting shRNA upon doxycycline addition. Protein levels of β-catenin and BCL-3 were analysed by western blot following 72 h of doxycycline treatment. Results are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DMM037697F1">Fig. 1</xref>C. Doxycycline addition in the LS174T/sh-β-catenin cells resulted in efficient suppression of total and active β-catenin from 48 h, with expression even further reduced by 72 h. No reduction in β-catenin protein was detected in sh-β-catenin cells without doxycycline treatment. Interestingly, BCL-3 expression was strongly induced following β-catenin suppression at the 48 and 72 h time points following doxycycline addition, suggesting that BCL-3 expression is repressed by Wnt/β-catenin signalling.

30775443	  <body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Approximately 70% of breast tumors express estrogen receptor α (ERα), most showing hormone dependence and responding to adjuvant endocrine therapies. These therapeutic regimens target estrogen signaling in cancer cells either with synthetic ER ligands, acting as partial receptor antagonists [selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)], such as 4OH-tamoxifen (TAM), and pure antagonists [selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs)], such as ICI 182,780 (ICI; fulvestrant), or by preventing peripheral androgen conversion to estrogen with aromatase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Although ERα blockade is effective in the majority of cases, intrinsic or de novo resistance to endocrine therapy of receptor-positive tumors, manifesting as disease relapse or progression to a metastatic setting, represents a key problem in the clinical management of patients with breast cancer (BC). Several mechanisms have been proposed to be responsible for endocrine therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>), including oncogenic activation of signaling pathways causing constitutive, ligand-independent activation of the receptor and genetic alterations of the ERα gene (<italic>ESR1</italic>). These include point mutations within the protein-coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>), in genetic elements controlling its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>) or causing functional alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ER pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>), that affect the ERα expression and/or protein conformation and thereby its basal- or ligand-induced activities. More recently, recurrent chromosomal aberrations causing synthesis of abnormally active ER fusion proteins have also been characterized in endocrine therapy–resistant BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). In all these cases, it has been demonstrated that ERα signaling remains active also in the absence of estrogen and/or the presence of antiestrogens, driving gene transcription, cell proliferation, and other key cellular functions required for cell survival and tumor progression. This suggests that in these cases, down-regulation of receptor expression, or disruption of its ability to control gene transcription in cancer cells, can be more effective than estrogen deprivation. On the basis of this assumption, the molecular partners of ERα involved in the multiprotein complexes it requires for its activity on transcription, and including epigenetic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>), represent potentially exploitable targets for new therapies against ER-positive, antiestrogen-resistant tumors.</p><p>By interaction proteomics, we identified the histone methyltransferase DOT1L (disruptor of telomeric silencing-1-like) as a component of these multiprotein complexes that assemble with ERα in BC cell nuclei after estrogen or antiestrogen treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). DOT1L catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine-79 (H3K79me), a marker of transcriptionally active genes, and is involved in transcription elongation, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). This enzyme associates with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins, exerting a key role in the transcriptional mechanisms sustaining leukemogenesis, and for this reason, its inhibitors have been proposed and are being clinically tested as therapeutic targets for MLL fusion leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Recent studies showed the potential therapeutic usefulness of DOT1L inhibition also in neuroblastoma and ovarian and prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). Direct involvement of this enzyme in promoting the aggressive phenotype of triple-negative BC by enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and a stem cell–like phenotype associating with transcriptional active c-Myc/p300 complexes has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>).</p><p>The role and functional significance of DOT1L association with ERα in hormone-responsive, luminal-like BC cell nuclei were investigated here in detail. Results demonstrate corecruitment of both factors, in combination with other epigenetic transcriptional regulators, in a sizeable fraction of ERα cistromes of MCF-7 cell chromatin, thereby influencing transcription of genes involved in key cellular functions, including <italic>ESR1</italic> (encoding ERα), <italic>FOXA1</italic>, and those of other ERα coregulators. DOT1L blockade with different selective chemical inhibitors, including pinometostat, currently tested in clinical trials for MLL-rearranged leukemia therapy, or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) interfered with estrogen effects on gene expression and caused growth inhibition by cell cycle arrest in G<sub>1</sub>, followed by massive apoptotic cell death, in hormone-responsive BC cell models, including also TAM- or ICI-resistant cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo, in a xenograft mouse model. These results demonstrate that DOT1L represents a novel molecular target for epigenetic therapies against hormone-responsive and ERα-positive, endocrine therapy–resistant breast tumors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>DOT1L is corecruited with ERα in BC cell chromatin</title><p>DOT1L was found to physically associate with ligand-bound ERα in MCF-7 cell nuclei, a result that led us to suggest a role of this enzyme in receptor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). This possibility is supported by the fact that both proteins are often coexpressed in breast tumors. Considering the ERα<sup>+</sup> BC gene expression datasets available in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, 80% of the cases showed <italic>DOT1L</italic> mRNA levels with <italic>Z</italic> score values above the first quartile (fig. S1A, upper panel), with ERα<sup>+</sup> tumors with higher DOT1L expression showing worse overall and relapse-free survival compared with the low expressing ones (fig. S1A, lower panels). For this reason, we set forth to investigate in detail the nature and function of the association between these two regulatory factors in BC cell nuclei. As shown in fig. S1 (B to E), the interaction involves a ligand-activated receptor, being observed only in the presence of 17β-estradiol (E2, 10<sup>−8</sup> M; fig. S1B). DOT1L associates within the C-terminal region of ERα that comprises the ligand-binding and transactivation function 2 (AF-2) domains of the protein (fig. S1C). DOT1L does not interact with ERβ (fig. S1D), the receptor subtype exerting opposite effects with respect to ERα in BC cells, where it activates antiproliferative and oncosuppressive circuities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>). This result suggests that this enzyme might play a specific role in the ERα-mediated regulation of gene transcription linked to the mitogenic actions of estrogen. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to protein identification and label-free quantitation by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) was then applied to identify additional components and cofactors of the DOT1L-ERα complex in MCF-7 cells. For this, in vivo cross-linked chromatin was fragmented and immunoprecipitated with anti-ERα, anti-DOT1L, or control antibodies and subjected to MS analysis, and the proteins copurified with each of the two factors in the genome were identified, as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> (left), ERα immunoprecipitates contain also DOT1L and the receptor is present in DOT1L samples, indicating that both proteins associate together with chromatin, a result confirmed in soluble protein extracts (fig. S1E). Overall, MS analysis identified 614 nuclear proteins copurified with ERα and 570 with DOT1L, the large majority (515) in common between the two factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and table S1). As shown in fig. S2A, these protein sets comprise 94 known interactors of ERα, 45 of DOT1L and 20 of both factors. Functional annotation analysis of the 515 proteins in common between the ERα and DOT1L indicates that these are involved in multiple biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), reflecting known effects of estrogen in BC, such as cell death and survival, gene expression, cellular growth and proliferation, DNA replication, and cell cycle, as well as those of DOT1L in leukemia and other cancers. This list includes known transcriptional coregulators of ERα, such as GREB1, NRIP1, and SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>), the bromodomain proteins BRD2 and BRD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>), KMT2A (MLL1/MLL), and KMT2D (MLL4), known to physically and functionally associate with both ERα and DOT1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Mapping ERα and DOT1L binding to MCF-7 cell genome by ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) confirmed colocalization of the two proteins in a sizeable number of chromatin sites. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, by comparing the positioning of the 33,492 ERα and 14,799 DOT1L binding sites identified, three main clusters emerged, representing ERα-only (red), DOT1L-only (blue), and ERα + DOT1L (green) binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and table S2, A to C). As reported in fig. S2B, the binding regions center in all three cases on transcription start sites (upper panels), with a larger number of ERα-only and ERα + DOT1L sites located in introns and DOT1L-only sites mainly found in intergenic regions (lower panels). ERα + DOT1L binds more often within enhancer and promoter regions, compared with ERα or DOT1L alone. A search for overrepresented transcription factor binding motifs in the binding sites identified revealed a prevalence of ERE (estrogen response element) or ERE-like sequences in ERα-only and ERα + DOT1L sites, and of FOXP1 binding matrices in DOT1L-only sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, right). Of note, FOXP1 is among the proteins found to be associated with DOT1L by ChIP-MS (table S1E). When considering that DOT1L does not bind DNA, these results suggest that its association with ERα could drive this enzyme to regulatory sites, such as enhancers and promoters, where the two proteins cooperate to regulate gene activity.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Functional analysis and physical mapping of DOT1L association with ERα in MCF-7 cell chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: ChIP–Western blot showing DOT1L/ERα corecruitment on chromatin.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>) in MLL cells under comparable experimental conditions. As H3K79 methylation by DOT1L is coupled with gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>), H3K79me2 ChIP-seq was then performed before and after DOT1L blockade with 6.4 μM EPZ for 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Results highlight the presence of H3K79me2 only in actively transcribed genes, detected by Nascent-seq (see below), more evident in those harboring DOT1L-alone or ERα-DOT1L binding sites within or near the transcription unit (TU; central panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Methylated histones are positioned prevalently toward the 5′ of the TUs and decrease substantially after EPZ treatment. To evaluate the relationships between transcriptional gene regulation by ERα and H3K79 methylation, MCF-7 cells were treated for 3 days with the pure antiestrogen ICI, inducing ERα down-regulation, and the effects on gene transcription rate were measured by Nascent-seq and compared with those relative to the amount of methylated H3K79 present within transcription units (TUs). As expected, blockade of ERα activity caused significant changes of transcription rate in a large number of genes (table S3C). Compared with activated ones, genes inhibited by ICI contain on average significantly higher levels of H3K79me2 that reduced upon ER blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, right panel). Since H3K79me2 levels on ICI-activated genes are not affected by antiestrogen treatment, these results suggest a link between transcriptional gene activation by estrogen (represented by ICI-inhibited genes) and H3K79 methylation by DOT1L. This was explored in more detail by measuring changes in gene transcription rates by Nascent-seq after EPZ or ICI treatment. DOT1L inhibition by EPZ changed the transcription rate of ca. 2500 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and table S3, A and B), including many known to be regulated directly by ERα in BC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). On the other hand, the gene response to ICI was greater and more extended than that to EPZ (fig. S2 B and C, and table S3C). However, about one-third of the genes affected by DOT1L inhibition responded similarly to ERα blockade (709 up- and 402 down-regulated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). TUs whose transcription is silenced by the two inhibitors are significantly enriched for ERα + DOT1L sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), further supporting the existence of a cooperation between the two proteins in estrogen-mediated transcriptional regulation in BC cells. This was confirmed also by functional evaluation of whole transcriptome changes induced in these cells by EPZ, which showed, among the pathways most affected by DOT1L blockade, inhibition of estrogen signaling, cell cycle, and DNA replication and activation of p53, transforming growth factor–β, PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)–AKT, and apoptosis signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and table S4, A and B).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>DOT1L inhibition affects ERα-dependent gene transcription in MCF-7 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Immunoblot analysis of global H3K79me1, H3K79me2, and H3K79me3 levels in MCF-7 cells following 3 or 6 days of treatment with EPZ at the indicated concentrations.

The effects of EPZ on MCF-7 cell proliferation was thus evaluated in detail, and results showed that it causes a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth that, at concentrations between 6.4 and 12.8 μM, was comparable to that caused by TAM or ICI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This effect results from a block of cell cycle progression in G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and massive induction of apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, D to F</xref>), similar to what was induced by ICI, although with slower kinetics. Growth and survival of these luminal-like BC cell lines are strictly dependent on estrogen, as confirmed here by the growth arrest and cell death caused by the inhibition of estrogen signaling with TAM or ICI (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The growth inhibitory effects of EPZ could thus be the consequence of an interference with estrogen actions in these cells. To investigate this possibility, the effects of EPZ were tested also in hormone-starved cells stimulated with a mitogenic dose of E2. Results showed that the drug was highly effective also in this experimental setting, where at a concentration of 6.4 μM, it caused inhibition of estrogen-induced cell proliferation by G<sub>1</sub> arrest and apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). These results suggest a link between ERα and DOT1L activities, which was further suggested by the finding that EPZ interfered to a similar extent with the transactivating functions of ERα on an ERE-luc reporter gene stably integrated in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>) and that inhibition of cell proliferation was observed also in other ERα<sup>+</sup>, estrogen-responsive BC cell lines (BT-474, T47-D, ZR-75.1, and ZR-75.30) under both the experimental conditions described above (fig. S3). Under the same experimental conditions, no significant response was observed, instead, in ERα-, hormone-unresponsive MDA-MB-231, although in the presence of H3K79me inhibition (fig. S4A), nor in HCC 1806, Hs 578T, and MDA-MB-468 cells (fig. S4B). The results obtained here in MDA-MB-231 cells are in contrast with what was reported by Zhang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>), where an effect of DOT1L inhibitors on the proliferation of these cells was observed instead, which may be due to differences in experimental settings, since DOT1L blockade has been shown to have an effect on BC stem cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>), which may ultimately result also in the reduction in cell number.</p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures embedded in the extracellular matrix better recapitulate the complex architecture of human tumors, with respect to 2D cultures, promoting formation of organotypic acinar structures or spheroids (organoids) with physiologically relevant cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, epithelial polarization, and differentiation, recapitulating human cancer histology in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>). The effects of EPZ on cell morphology, polarization, and growth were thus evaluated also in 3D MCF-7 cell cultures, as described in Materials and Methods. EPZ induced significant effects in key morphofunctional parameters of MCF-7 cell organoids (fig. S5, A to C), including blockade of growth (area), more pronounced at day 9 of treatment, matched by increased cell death (density red) and accompanied by structural changes, represented by loss of their original shape (roundness) and characteristic of epithelial or acinar differentiation, and decrease in the length of “appendages” (max appendage), protrusions from the organoid mimicking invasiveness. The same effects were observed in ZR75.1, but not in MDA-MB-468 cells (fig. S5, D and E), confirming what was obtained in 2D cultures (fig. S5B). Together, these results demonstrate that DOT1L blockade affects ER<sup>+</sup> BC cell proliferation, survival, and, possibly, aggressiveness, confirming the results obtained in 2D culture models and further supporting the existence of a functional link between ERα and DOT1L to control key phenotypes of hormone-responsive BC cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DOT1L activity is required for efficient estrogen signaling in BC cells</title><p>The overlap between the effects of DOT1L blockade on gene transcription with those elicited by antiestrogens indicates that this enzyme is involved in the control of key steps of the estrogen pathway in MCF-7 cells. Searching for one or more genomic targets of DOT1L endowed with a “master” role in estrogenic signaling, we implemented the IPA Upstream Regulator analysis. This method exploits the known effects of master upstream regulatory factors (URs) on their target genes to pinpoint key regulators responsible for the global gene expression changes detected in response to a given stimulus or condition. It takes into account the number of transcripts encoded by known target genes of transcriptional regulators and, for each of these, the direction of change with respect to the control (i.e., increase or decrease). This method was implemented on transcriptomics data from MCF-7 cells treated with EPZ, TAM, or ICI [tables S3 (A and B), S4 (A and B), and S5A] and ZR-75.1 cells treated with EPZ (table S5B), searching for evidence of URs whose activity was similarly affected by the two antiestrogens and EPZ. Results highlighted 45 factors affected in the same way (activation or inhibition) in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). ESR1 was the top hit among inhibited URs, together with its pioneering factor FOXA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>) and coregulators GATA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>) and CTR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>). This result was confirmed experimentally, since EPZ treatment decreased ERα mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner (&gt;80% after 6 to 8 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). ChIP-seq data provided mechanistic evidence to explain the effects of the drug on <italic>ESR1</italic> silencing, as DOT1L was found to be associated with key regulatory sites of the gene, in the promoter region and an upstream enhancer, tethered to ERα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Both EPZ and ICI caused complete loss of ERα and DOT1L binding to these sites, accompanied by notable reduction in H3K79me2 levels along the TU, accumulation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 and decrease in H3K4me3 on the promoter (fig. S6A), epigenetic marks of gene repression in the former and activation in the latter, and <italic>ESR1</italic> transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Several other known estrogen-responsive genes, including in particular <italic>FOXA1</italic> and <italic>TFF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), showed a similar response to the inhibitors. The upstream <italic>ESR1</italic> enhancer is of particular interest, as it is known to physically interact with the promoter to regulate its activity and includes the single-nucleotide variant rs9383590, which has been shown to promote sustained ESR1 expression in BC and to be associated with enhanced BC risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Enhancer regions often transcribe small noncoding RNA, named “enhancer RNAs” (eRNAs), involved in enhancer-promoter looping and thereby regulation of the target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>). Changes in enhancer activity are often accompanied by changes in the expression of their eRNAs, whose levels are therefore markers of enhancer activity. EPZ treatment affected eRNAs of 372 enhancers in MCF-7 cells (table S6) and, among these, decreased <italic>ESR1</italic> enhancer eRNAs (fig. S6), demonstrating reduced activity of this genetic element upon DOT1L blockade. These results were further supported by the fact that ERα reduction induced by either EPZ or ICI results in a mirroring reduction in DOT1L on the common chromatin binding sites (fig. S6B), including in particular both enhancer and promoter sites located upstream of the ESR1 gene (fig. S6C). Effects comparable to those of EPZ were observed with other small-molecule DOT1L inhibitors, in particular EPZ-5676 (pinometostat) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>), currently in clinical trials for use against MLL-rearranged acute leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>), and the EPZ-brominated analog SGC0946 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Both these compounds were highly effective in reducing H3K79me1, H3K79me2, and H3K79me3 and ERα mRNA and protein levels in MCF-7 cells (fig. S7A), and in strongly inhibiting MCF-7 and ZR-75.1, but again, not MDA-MB-231, cell proliferation (fig. S7B). The effects of the three different DOT1L inhibitors on ERα expression and MCF-7 cell proliferation were mimicked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the enzyme (fig.

This evidence suggests that this enzyme could represent an ideal drug target to silence the ERα pathway in endocrine therapy–resistant breast tumors that maintain hormone responsiveness and express mutated and/or constitutively active receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>).

Global analysis of gene expression in response to TAM confirmed lack of significant gene responses in LCC2 (fig. S9, A and B, and table S7A). The association between ERα and DOT1L was detectable also in this cell line by coimmunoprecipitation, despite the lower ERα protein level (fig. S10A). Upon exposure to EPZ, these cells showed, instead, a marked inhibition of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), H3K79 methylation (fig.

To this aim, orthotopic xenograft models were established by injecting luciferase-expressing MCF-7–Luc or LCC2-Luc cells in the mammary fat pad of nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, and tumor size was monitored by weekly measurement of bioluminescence signals. At 21 to 28 days from cell inoculation, when tumor sizes reached 50 to 150 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomized into treatment and control groups (eight per group) and implanted with mini-osmotic pumps loaded with EPZ (50 mg/ml) or vehicle alone, as described in Materials and Methods. This dose has been shown sufficient to achieve average EPZ circulating levels of 0.55 ± 0.12 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>), lower than the concentration causing maximum inhibitory effects in BC cells in vitro but sufficient to achieve a partial response to this drug in MLL cells in vivo, under comparable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Tumor growth was then monitored at 7, 14, and 21 days, when all animals were euthanized and tumors were harvested and analyzed for H3K79me2 and ERα levels.

Despite its proven efficacy, intrinsic and acquired resistance, manifesting clinically as a relapse or progression of the disease, occurs in ca. one-third of the cases and represents a limit to its usefulness. Among the multiple mechanisms proposed as responsible for endocrine resistance in BCs, deregulation or mutations of key components of the estrogen signaling pathway, including ERα itself, that makes it constitutive or unresponsive to hormonal antagonists have been shown to be responsible for a large fraction of these cases. For this reason, the possibility of silencing ERα expression and/or activity in cancer cells is considered an effective approach to overcome resistance in these cases. Much attention is thus being currently given to the existence of molecular components of the ER effector pathway, in particular epigenetic effectors of its nuclear pathway that can be used as novel drug targets to this end. The molecular mechanisms by which ERα promotes BC growth and progression involve formation in the cell nucleus of multiprotein complexes endowed with key functional regulatory roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>). These include the coordinated assembly on chromatin of transcriptional regulatory complexes, catalyzed and targeted to specific sites by the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>), that are responsible for conveying hormonal signaling to the genome. Several proteins that serve as epigenetic modifiers are known to be part of these complexes, and their recruitment allows the chromatin modification/remodeling steps essential to allow ERα-dependent gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). We demonstrate here that the epigenetic “writer” DOT1L is guided to several regulatory sites on the genome by tethering to the receptor, including elements that control the activity of the gene encoding ERα itself and key components of its signaling pathway. The ability of DOT1L to promote transcription elongation, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression via H3K79 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>) is essential to allow estrogen-induced promotion of BC cell proliferation and survival mediated by ERα. Inhibition of this enzyme induces a specific reprogramming of the hormone-responsive BC cell transcriptome, determining severe functional consequences in the cell, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death. Investigating the composition of chromatin-bound ERα-DOT1L interactome revealed that several of its components are already known to affect key processes in BC cells, including cell cycle progression, cell survival, and transcription, further supporting the relevance of the molecular machinery discovered here for BC cell regulation. These include, among others, known ERα interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>) as well as epigenetic regulators such as KMT2A, KMT2D, BRD2, and BRD4, and transcription regulators such as ASH2L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>), NRIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>), and YBX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>), all known to be involved in the control of gene regulation by estrogen in these cells by acting in concert with ERα. The finding that an ERα-DOT1L complex binds in regulatory sites and thereby controls transcription of genes essential for hormonal signaling, including not only ERα itself but also, among others, the pioneering factor FOXA1, a key player in estrogen regulation of genome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>), revealed that this complex belongs to a positive regulatory loop maintaining optimal cellular levels of receptor and several of its functional partners. As a consequence, inhibiting the activity of this epienzyme disrupts estrogen signaling not only directly, by interference with trans-acting functions of the receptor and other transcription factors participating to the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>), whose consensus matrices are overrepresented in the DOT1L binding sites mapped here, but also indirectly, by reducing the cellular levels of ERα and other key components of its pathway. We show here that ERα and DOT1L colocalize within the promoter and enhancer regions of the ESR1 gene and that DOT1L and the H3K79 dimethylation it catalyzes are required for ESR1 transcription. Together with FOXA1 and the other known ER interactors cited above, TRIM24, a “reader” of dual histone marks acting on estrogen-dependent genes associated with cellular proliferation and tumor development and linked to poor prognosis of BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><italic>43</italic></xref>), the progesterone receptor, recently shown to modulate ERα actions in hormone-responsive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44"><italic>44</italic></xref>), and GPER1, mediating nongenomic actions of estrogen and considered an initiator of TAM resistance in BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45"><italic>45</italic></xref>), are worth mentioning.</p><p>As a consequence of the positive role of DOT1L in estrogen signaling and maintenance of cellular ERα levels, its inhibition mimics the effects of antiestrogens (both SERMs and SERDs) on the cell transcriptome and behavior, in particular proliferation and ability to survive, and this might occur also by affecting BC stem cell–like properties, as demonstrated by Cho <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). These results suggested that DOT1L inhibition could be exploited to induce “antiestrogen-like” responses in tumor cells that acquired resistance to these drugs during hormonal therapies. By analyzing data relative to ERα<sup>+</sup> tumors present in TCGA, we observed that aggressive tumors, with a worse prognosis that almost invariably reflects in these cases resistance to endocrine therapy, show higher DOT1L expression, further supporting the clinical relevance and usefulness of targeting this enzyme in such tumors. This possibility was challenged here on several antiestrogen (both TAM and ICI)–resistant human BC cell models, and the results obtained both in vitro and in vivo confirm that targeting DOT1L to achieve inhibition of estrogen signaling, growth inhibition, and cell death represents an actionable option against ab initio or acquired endocrine therapy resistance in BCs. Razavi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>) recently showed in a large cohort of ERα<sup>+</sup> BC samples that hormone resistance arising after hormonal therapy is characterized by accumulation of mutations of <italic>ESR1</italic> or other genes of the receptor pathway in the tumor in ca. 20% of the cases and that mutations in these genes are significantly more common in metastases compared with primary tumors. Enrichment in these mutations was found mutually exclusive with regard to MAPK pathway genes (22% of the cases). Since the large majority of these ESR1 mutations affect receptor activity and responsiveness to ligands and the MAPK pathway activation is well known to cause phosphorylation of ERα, which thereby becomes constitutively active and insensitive to antiestrogens, it is not unexpected that in all cases, the patient fails to respond to endocrine therapy. The presence of a receptor abnormally active as a result of a structural variation caused by a mutation, or of posttranslational modifications induced by a deregulated signaling pathway, drives tumor progression with the same molecular mechanisms normally set in motion by estrogen, but insensitive to either agonist (estrogen hormones) or antagonist (TAM, ICI, etc.) ligands. In all these cases, representing a large fraction of endocrine therapy–resistant tumors, the possibility of silencing the ESR1 gene, clearing ERα from the cell, is a rational approach worth considering. DOT1L is particularly suitable to this aim, since several effective inhibitors of this enzyme are being actively investigated as potential anticancer drugs. A phase 1 clinical trial with the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ5676 used here in patients with MLL fusion gene–driven leukemia, for example, has recently ended, and the results confirmed the therapeutic potential of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>), although its efficacy as a single agent was modest. In this respect, we observed that cotreatment of MCF-7 cells with TAM and EPZ led to an additive effect of the two drugs (data not shown), a result not surprising in view of the common downstream target of both drugs, i.e., ERα, but of interest in view of the possibility to combine DOT1L inhibitors with endocrine therapy in such cases where a more effective blockade of estrogen signaling may be beneficial. If these studies yield positive results, repositioning DOT1L inhibitors for BC therapy could benefit from a substantial reduction in the time and costs necessary to evaluate their actual efficacy against these tumors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>MCF-7 (HTB-22), ZR-75.1 (CRL-1500), ZR-75.30 (CRL-150), T-47D (HTB-13), BT-474 (HTB-20), MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26), MDA-MB-468 (HTB-132), Hs 578T (HTB-126), HCC 1806 (CRL-2335), and MCF-10A (CRL-10317) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.

30775443	  <body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Approximately 70% of breast tumors express estrogen receptor α (ERα), most showing hormone dependence and responding to adjuvant endocrine therapies. These therapeutic regimens target estrogen signaling in cancer cells either with synthetic ER ligands, acting as partial receptor antagonists [selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)], such as 4OH-tamoxifen (TAM), and pure antagonists [selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs)], such as ICI 182,780 (ICI; fulvestrant), or by preventing peripheral androgen conversion to estrogen with aromatase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Although ERα blockade is effective in the majority of cases, intrinsic or de novo resistance to endocrine therapy of receptor-positive tumors, manifesting as disease relapse or progression to a metastatic setting, represents a key problem in the clinical management of patients with breast cancer (BC). Several mechanisms have been proposed to be responsible for endocrine therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>), including oncogenic activation of signaling pathways causing constitutive, ligand-independent activation of the receptor and genetic alterations of the ERα gene (<italic>ESR1</italic>). These include point mutations within the protein-coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>), in genetic elements controlling its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>) or causing functional alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ER pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>), that affect the ERα expression and/or protein conformation and thereby its basal- or ligand-induced activities. More recently, recurrent chromosomal aberrations causing synthesis of abnormally active ER fusion proteins have also been characterized in endocrine therapy–resistant BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). In all these cases, it has been demonstrated that ERα signaling remains active also in the absence of estrogen and/or the presence of antiestrogens, driving gene transcription, cell proliferation, and other key cellular functions required for cell survival and tumor progression. This suggests that in these cases, down-regulation of receptor expression, or disruption of its ability to control gene transcription in cancer cells, can be more effective than estrogen deprivation. On the basis of this assumption, the molecular partners of ERα involved in the multiprotein complexes it requires for its activity on transcription, and including epigenetic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>), represent potentially exploitable targets for new therapies against ER-positive, antiestrogen-resistant tumors.</p><p>By interaction proteomics, we identified the histone methyltransferase DOT1L (disruptor of telomeric silencing-1-like) as a component of these multiprotein complexes that assemble with ERα in BC cell nuclei after estrogen or antiestrogen treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). DOT1L catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine-79 (H3K79me), a marker of transcriptionally active genes, and is involved in transcription elongation, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). This enzyme associates with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion proteins, exerting a key role in the transcriptional mechanisms sustaining leukemogenesis, and for this reason, its inhibitors have been proposed and are being clinically tested as therapeutic targets for MLL fusion leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Recent studies showed the potential therapeutic usefulness of DOT1L inhibition also in neuroblastoma and ovarian and prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). Direct involvement of this enzyme in promoting the aggressive phenotype of triple-negative BC by enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and a stem cell–like phenotype associating with transcriptional active c-Myc/p300 complexes has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>).</p><p>The role and functional significance of DOT1L association with ERα in hormone-responsive, luminal-like BC cell nuclei were investigated here in detail. Results demonstrate corecruitment of both factors, in combination with other epigenetic transcriptional regulators, in a sizeable fraction of ERα cistromes of MCF-7 cell chromatin, thereby influencing transcription of genes involved in key cellular functions, including <italic>ESR1</italic> (encoding ERα), <italic>FOXA1</italic>, and those of other ERα coregulators. DOT1L blockade with different selective chemical inhibitors, including pinometostat, currently tested in clinical trials for MLL-rearranged leukemia therapy, or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) interfered with estrogen effects on gene expression and caused growth inhibition by cell cycle arrest in G<sub>1</sub>, followed by massive apoptotic cell death, in hormone-responsive BC cell models, including also TAM- or ICI-resistant cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo, in a xenograft mouse model. These results demonstrate that DOT1L represents a novel molecular target for epigenetic therapies against hormone-responsive and ERα-positive, endocrine therapy–resistant breast tumors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>DOT1L is corecruited with ERα in BC cell chromatin</title><p>DOT1L was found to physically associate with ligand-bound ERα in MCF-7 cell nuclei, a result that led us to suggest a role of this enzyme in receptor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). This possibility is supported by the fact that both proteins are often coexpressed in breast tumors. Considering the ERα<sup>+</sup> BC gene expression datasets available in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, 80% of the cases showed <italic>DOT1L</italic> mRNA levels with <italic>Z</italic> score values above the first quartile (fig. S1A, upper panel), with ERα<sup>+</sup> tumors with higher DOT1L expression showing worse overall and relapse-free survival compared with the low expressing ones (fig. S1A, lower panels). For this reason, we set forth to investigate in detail the nature and function of the association between these two regulatory factors in BC cell nuclei. As shown in fig. S1 (B to E), the interaction involves a ligand-activated receptor, being observed only in the presence of 17β-estradiol (E2, 10<sup>−8</sup> M; fig. S1B). DOT1L associates within the C-terminal region of ERα that comprises the ligand-binding and transactivation function 2 (AF-2) domains of the protein (fig. S1C). DOT1L does not interact with ERβ (fig. S1D), the receptor subtype exerting opposite effects with respect to ERα in BC cells, where it activates antiproliferative and oncosuppressive circuities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>). This result suggests that this enzyme might play a specific role in the ERα-mediated regulation of gene transcription linked to the mitogenic actions of estrogen. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to protein identification and label-free quantitation by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) was then applied to identify additional components and cofactors of the DOT1L-ERα complex in MCF-7 cells. For this, in vivo cross-linked chromatin was fragmented and immunoprecipitated with anti-ERα, anti-DOT1L, or control antibodies and subjected to MS analysis, and the proteins copurified with each of the two factors in the genome were identified, as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> (left), ERα immunoprecipitates contain also DOT1L and the receptor is present in DOT1L samples, indicating that both proteins associate together with chromatin, a result confirmed in soluble protein extracts (fig. S1E). Overall, MS analysis identified 614 nuclear proteins copurified with ERα and 570 with DOT1L, the large majority (515) in common between the two factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and table S1). As shown in fig. S2A, these protein sets comprise 94 known interactors of ERα, 45 of DOT1L and 20 of both factors. Functional annotation analysis of the 515 proteins in common between the ERα and DOT1L indicates that these are involved in multiple biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), reflecting known effects of estrogen in BC, such as cell death and survival, gene expression, cellular growth and proliferation, DNA replication, and cell cycle, as well as those of DOT1L in leukemia and other cancers. This list includes known transcriptional coregulators of ERα, such as GREB1, NRIP1, and SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>), the bromodomain proteins BRD2 and BRD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>), KMT2A (MLL1/MLL), and KMT2D (MLL4), known to physically and functionally associate with both ERα and DOT1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Mapping ERα and DOT1L binding to MCF-7 cell genome by ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) confirmed colocalization of the two proteins in a sizeable number of chromatin sites. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, by comparing the positioning of the 33,492 ERα and 14,799 DOT1L binding sites identified, three main clusters emerged, representing ERα-only (red), DOT1L-only (blue), and ERα + DOT1L (green) binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and table S2, A to C). As reported in fig. S2B, the binding regions center in all three cases on transcription start sites (upper panels), with a larger number of ERα-only and ERα + DOT1L sites located in introns and DOT1L-only sites mainly found in intergenic regions (lower panels). ERα + DOT1L binds more often within enhancer and promoter regions, compared with ERα or DOT1L alone. A search for overrepresented transcription factor binding motifs in the binding sites identified revealed a prevalence of ERE (estrogen response element) or ERE-like sequences in ERα-only and ERα + DOT1L sites, and of FOXP1 binding matrices in DOT1L-only sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, right). Of note, FOXP1 is among the proteins found to be associated with DOT1L by ChIP-MS (table S1E). When considering that DOT1L does not bind DNA, these results suggest that its association with ERα could drive this enzyme to regulatory sites, such as enhancers and promoters, where the two proteins cooperate to regulate gene activity.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Functional analysis and physical mapping of DOT1L association with ERα in MCF-7 cell chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: ChIP–Western blot showing DOT1L/ERα corecruitment on chromatin.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> (left), EPZ causes a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in global mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K79 levels in MCF-7 cell chromatin, more pronounced for the dimethylated form (H3K79me2), which after 3 days decreased by &gt;70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, right), showing a response comparable to what was observed by Daigle <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>) in MLL cells under comparable experimental conditions. As H3K79 methylation by DOT1L is coupled with gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>), H3K79me2 ChIP-seq was then performed before and after DOT1L blockade with 6.4 μM EPZ for 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Results highlight the presence of H3K79me2 only in actively transcribed genes, detected by Nascent-seq (see below), more evident in those harboring DOT1L-alone or ERα-DOT1L binding sites within or near the transcription unit (TU; central panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Methylated histones are positioned prevalently toward the 5′ of the TUs and decrease substantially after EPZ treatment. To evaluate the relationships between transcriptional gene regulation by ERα and H3K79 methylation, MCF-7 cells were treated for 3 days with the pure antiestrogen ICI, inducing ERα down-regulation, and the effects on gene transcription rate were measured by Nascent-seq and compared with those relative to the amount of methylated H3K79 present within transcription units (TUs). As expected, blockade of ERα activity caused significant changes of transcription rate in a large number of genes (table S3C). Compared with activated ones, genes inhibited by ICI contain on average significantly higher levels of H3K79me2 that reduced upon ER blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, right panel). Since H3K79me2 levels on ICI-activated genes are not affected by antiestrogen treatment, these results suggest a link between transcriptional gene activation by estrogen (represented by ICI-inhibited genes) and H3K79 methylation by DOT1L. This was explored in more detail by measuring changes in gene transcription rates by Nascent-seq after EPZ or ICI treatment. DOT1L inhibition by EPZ changed the transcription rate of ca. 2500 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and table S3, A and B), including many known to be regulated directly by ERα in BC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). On the other hand, the gene response to ICI was greater and more extended than that to EPZ (fig. S2 B and C, and table S3C). However, about one-third of the genes affected by DOT1L inhibition responded similarly to ERα blockade (709 up- and 402 down-regulated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). TUs whose transcription is silenced by the two inhibitors are significantly enriched for ERα + DOT1L sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), further supporting the existence of a cooperation between the two proteins in estrogen-mediated transcriptional regulation in BC cells. This was confirmed also by functional evaluation of whole transcriptome changes induced in these cells by EPZ, which showed, among the pathways most affected by DOT1L blockade, inhibition of estrogen signaling, cell cycle, and DNA replication and activation of p53, transforming growth factor–β, PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)–AKT, and apoptosis signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and table S4, A and B).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>DOT1L inhibition affects ERα-dependent gene transcription in MCF-7 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Immunoblot analysis of global H3K79me1, H3K79me2, and H3K79me3 levels in MCF-7 cells following 3 or 6 days of treatment with EPZ at the indicated concentrations.

The effects of EPZ on MCF-7 cell proliferation was thus evaluated in detail, and results showed that it causes a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth that, at concentrations between 6.4 and 12.8 μM, was comparable to that caused by TAM or ICI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This effect results from a block of cell cycle progression in G<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and massive induction of apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, D to F</xref>), similar to what was induced by ICI, although with slower kinetics. Growth and survival of these luminal-like BC cell lines are strictly dependent on estrogen, as confirmed here by the growth arrest and cell death caused by the inhibition of estrogen signaling with TAM or ICI (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The growth inhibitory effects of EPZ could thus be the consequence of an interference with estrogen actions in these cells. To investigate this possibility, the effects of EPZ were tested also in hormone-starved cells stimulated with a mitogenic dose of E2. Results showed that the drug was highly effective also in this experimental setting, where at a concentration of 6.4 μM, it caused inhibition of estrogen-induced cell proliferation by G<sub>1</sub> arrest and apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). These results suggest a link between ERα and DOT1L activities, which was further suggested by the finding that EPZ interfered to a similar extent with the transactivating functions of ERα on an ERE-luc reporter gene stably integrated in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>) and that inhibition of cell proliferation was observed also in other ERα<sup>+</sup>, estrogen-responsive BC cell lines (BT-474, T47-D, ZR-75.1, and ZR-75.30) under both the experimental conditions described above (fig. S3). Under the same experimental conditions, no significant response was observed, instead, in ERα-, hormone-unresponsive MDA-MB-231, although in the presence of H3K79me inhibition (fig. S4A), nor in HCC 1806, Hs 578T, and MDA-MB-468 cells (fig. S4B). The results obtained here in MDA-MB-231 cells are in contrast with what was reported by Zhang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>), where an effect of DOT1L inhibitors on the proliferation of these cells was observed instead, which may be due to differences in experimental settings, since DOT1L blockade has been shown to have an effect on BC stem cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>), which may ultimately result also in the reduction in cell number.</p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures embedded in the extracellular matrix better recapitulate the complex architecture of human tumors, with respect to 2D cultures, promoting formation of organotypic acinar structures or spheroids (organoids) with physiologically relevant cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, epithelial polarization, and differentiation, recapitulating human cancer histology in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>). The effects of EPZ on cell morphology, polarization, and growth were thus evaluated also in 3D MCF-7 cell cultures, as described in Materials and Methods. EPZ induced significant effects in key morphofunctional parameters of MCF-7 cell organoids (fig. S5, A to C), including blockade of growth (area), more pronounced at day 9 of treatment, matched by increased cell death (density red) and accompanied by structural changes, represented by loss of their original shape (roundness) and characteristic of epithelial or acinar differentiation, and decrease in the length of “appendages” (max appendage), protrusions from the organoid mimicking invasiveness. The same effects were observed in ZR75.1, but not in MDA-MB-468 cells (fig. S5, D and E), confirming what was obtained in 2D cultures (fig. S5B). Together, these results demonstrate that DOT1L blockade affects ER<sup>+</sup> BC cell proliferation, survival, and, possibly, aggressiveness, confirming the results obtained in 2D culture models and further supporting the existence of a functional link between ERα and DOT1L to control key phenotypes of hormone-responsive BC cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DOT1L activity is required for efficient estrogen signaling in BC cells</title><p>The overlap between the effects of DOT1L blockade on gene transcription with those elicited by antiestrogens indicates that this enzyme is involved in the control of key steps of the estrogen pathway in MCF-7 cells. Searching for one or more genomic targets of DOT1L endowed with a “master” role in estrogenic signaling, we implemented the IPA Upstream Regulator analysis. This method exploits the known effects of master upstream regulatory factors (URs) on their target genes to pinpoint key regulators responsible for the global gene expression changes detected in response to a given stimulus or condition. It takes into account the number of transcripts encoded by known target genes of transcriptional regulators and, for each of these, the direction of change with respect to the control (i.e., increase or decrease). This method was implemented on transcriptomics data from MCF-7 cells treated with EPZ, TAM, or ICI [tables S3 (A and B), S4 (A and B), and S5A] and ZR-75.1 cells treated with EPZ (table S5B), searching for evidence of URs whose activity was similarly affected by the two antiestrogens and EPZ. Results highlighted 45 factors affected in the same way (activation or inhibition) in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). ESR1 was the top hit among inhibited URs, together with its pioneering factor FOXA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>) and coregulators GATA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>) and CTR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>). This result was confirmed experimentally, since EPZ treatment decreased ERα mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner (&gt;80% after 6 to 8 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). ChIP-seq data provided mechanistic evidence to explain the effects of the drug on <italic>ESR1</italic> silencing, as DOT1L was found to be associated with key regulatory sites of the gene, in the promoter region and an upstream enhancer, tethered to ERα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Both EPZ and ICI caused complete loss of ERα and DOT1L binding to these sites, accompanied by notable reduction in H3K79me2 levels along the TU, accumulation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 and decrease in H3K4me3 on the promoter (fig. S6A), epigenetic marks of gene repression in the former and activation in the latter, and <italic>ESR1</italic> transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Several other known estrogen-responsive genes, including in particular <italic>FOXA1</italic> and <italic>TFF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), showed a similar response to the inhibitors. The upstream <italic>ESR1</italic> enhancer is of particular interest, as it is known to physically interact with the promoter to regulate its activity and includes the single-nucleotide variant rs9383590, which has been shown to promote sustained ESR1 expression in BC and to be associated with enhanced BC risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Enhancer regions often transcribe small noncoding RNA, named “enhancer RNAs” (eRNAs), involved in enhancer-promoter looping and thereby regulation of the target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>). Changes in enhancer activity are often accompanied by changes in the expression of their eRNAs, whose levels are therefore markers of enhancer activity. EPZ treatment affected eRNAs of 372 enhancers in MCF-7 cells (table S6) and, among these, decreased <italic>ESR1</italic> enhancer eRNAs (fig. S6), demonstrating reduced activity of this genetic element upon DOT1L blockade. These results were further supported by the fact that ERα reduction induced by either EPZ or ICI results in a mirroring reduction in DOT1L on the common chromatin binding sites (fig. S6B), including in particular both enhancer and promoter sites located upstream of the ESR1 gene (fig. S6C). Effects comparable to those of EPZ were observed with other small-molecule DOT1L inhibitors, in particular EPZ-5676 (pinometostat) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>), currently in clinical trials for use against MLL-rearranged acute leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>), and the EPZ-brominated analog SGC0946 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Both these compounds were highly effective in reducing H3K79me1, H3K79me2, and H3K79me3 and ERα mRNA and protein levels in MCF-7 cells (fig. S7A), and in strongly inhibiting MCF-7 and ZR-75.1, but again, not MDA-MB-231, cell proliferation (fig. S7B).

Global analysis of gene expression in response to TAM confirmed lack of significant gene responses in LCC2 (fig. S9, A and B, and table S7A). The association between ERα and DOT1L was detectable also in this cell line by coimmunoprecipitation, despite the lower ERα protein level (fig. S10A). Upon exposure to EPZ, these cells showed, instead, a marked inhibition of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>), H3K79 methylation (fig.

S10E), consequent to G<sub>1</sub> arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, I to L</xref>, and fig. S10, G and I). These results indicate that blockade by DOT1L inhibition of ERα expression and, as a consequence, activity causes growth arrest, accompanied by massive apoptotic cell death, and interferes with the hormonal pathway in antiestrogen-resistant, ERα<sup>+</sup> BC cells independently from the cellular background and the molecular mechanism responsible for resistance to the drug.</p><p>Given the practical implications of these findings for cancer therapy, they were challenged in an animal model of TAM-resistant ERα<sup>+</sup> BC to assess whether EPZ was capable of inhibiting tumor growth also in vivo. To this aim, orthotopic xenograft models were established by injecting luciferase-expressing MCF-7–Luc or LCC2-Luc cells in the mammary fat pad of nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, and tumor size was monitored by weekly measurement of bioluminescence signals. At 21 to 28 days from cell inoculation, when tumor sizes reached 50 to 150 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were randomized into treatment and control groups (eight per group) and implanted with mini-osmotic pumps loaded with EPZ (50 mg/ml) or vehicle alone, as described in Materials and Methods. This dose has been shown sufficient to achieve average EPZ circulating levels of 0.55 ± 0.12 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>), lower than the concentration causing maximum inhibitory effects in BC cells in vitro but sufficient to achieve a partial response to this drug in MLL cells in vivo, under comparable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Tumor growth was then monitored at 7, 14, and 21 days, when all animals were euthanized and tumors were harvested and analyzed for H3K79me2 and ERα levels. MCF-7 and LCC2 tumors in mice treated with EPZ showed five- and threefold reduction in bioluminescence activity, respectively, compared with control (vehicle) animals, a result confirmed by measuring their weight postmortem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>, upper panels). Immunoblot analysis of global H3K79me2 levels showed a marked reduction in EPZ versus vehicle tumors in both cases, parallel to a decrease in ERα protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>, lower panels). These data are all consistent with those described above for EPZ-treated MCF-7 cells in 2D or 3D cell models and further suggest that this enzyme represents a new, readily exploitable therapeutic target against hormone-responsive and endocrine therapy–resistant cancers.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>DOT1L pharmacological targeting affects antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant BC cell tumor progression in vivo.</title><p>Top: Mice carrying tumors obtained by orthotopical injections of MCF-7–luciferase (<bold>A</bold>) or MCF-7/LCC2–luciferase (<bold>B</bold>) cells in the mammary fat pad were implanted with pumps containing either a solution of EPZ (50 mg/ml) or vehicle (DMSO).

Despite its proven efficacy, intrinsic and acquired resistance, manifesting clinically as a relapse or progression of the disease, occurs in ca. one-third of the cases and represents a limit to its usefulness. Among the multiple mechanisms proposed as responsible for endocrine resistance in BCs, deregulation or mutations of key components of the estrogen signaling pathway, including ERα itself, that makes it constitutive or unresponsive to hormonal antagonists have been shown to be responsible for a large fraction of these cases. For this reason, the possibility of silencing ERα expression and/or activity in cancer cells is considered an effective approach to overcome resistance in these cases. Much attention is thus being currently given to the existence of molecular components of the ER effector pathway, in particular epigenetic effectors of its nuclear pathway that can be used as novel drug targets to this end. The molecular mechanisms by which ERα promotes BC growth and progression involve formation in the cell nucleus of multiprotein complexes endowed with key functional regulatory roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>). These include the coordinated assembly on chromatin of transcriptional regulatory complexes, catalyzed and targeted to specific sites by the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>), that are responsible for conveying hormonal signaling to the genome. Several proteins that serve as epigenetic modifiers are known to be part of these complexes, and their recruitment allows the chromatin modification/remodeling steps essential to allow ERα-dependent gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). We demonstrate here that the epigenetic “writer” DOT1L is guided to several regulatory sites on the genome by tethering to the receptor, including elements that control the activity of the gene encoding ERα itself and key components of its signaling pathway. The ability of DOT1L to promote transcription elongation, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression via H3K79 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>) is essential to allow estrogen-induced promotion of BC cell proliferation and survival mediated by ERα. Inhibition of this enzyme induces a specific reprogramming of the hormone-responsive BC cell transcriptome, determining severe functional consequences in the cell, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death. Investigating the composition of chromatin-bound ERα-DOT1L interactome revealed that several of its components are already known to affect key processes in BC cells, including cell cycle progression, cell survival, and transcription, further supporting the relevance of the molecular machinery discovered here for BC cell regulation. These include, among others, known ERα interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>) as well as epigenetic regulators such as KMT2A, KMT2D, BRD2, and BRD4, and transcription regulators such as ASH2L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>), NRIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>), and YBX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>), all known to be involved in the control of gene regulation by estrogen in these cells by acting in concert with ERα. The finding that an ERα-DOT1L complex binds in regulatory sites and thereby controls transcription of genes essential for hormonal signaling, including not only ERα itself but also, among others, the pioneering factor FOXA1, a key player in estrogen regulation of genome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>), revealed that this complex belongs to a positive regulatory loop maintaining optimal cellular levels of receptor and several of its functional partners. As a consequence, inhibiting the activity of this epienzyme disrupts estrogen signaling not only directly, by interference with trans-acting functions of the receptor and other transcription factors participating to the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>), whose consensus matrices are overrepresented in the DOT1L binding sites mapped here, but also indirectly, by reducing the cellular levels of ERα and other key components of its pathway. We show here that ERα and DOT1L colocalize within the promoter and enhancer regions of the ESR1 gene and that DOT1L and the H3K79 dimethylation it catalyzes are required for ESR1 transcription. Together with FOXA1 and the other known ER interactors cited above, TRIM24, a “reader” of dual histone marks acting on estrogen-dependent genes associated with cellular proliferation and tumor development and linked to poor prognosis of BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><italic>43</italic></xref>), the progesterone receptor, recently shown to modulate ERα actions in hormone-responsive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44"><italic>44</italic></xref>), and GPER1, mediating nongenomic actions of estrogen and considered an initiator of TAM resistance in BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45"><italic>45</italic></xref>), are worth mentioning.</p><p>As a consequence of the positive role of DOT1L in estrogen signaling and maintenance of cellular ERα levels, its inhibition mimics the effects of antiestrogens (both SERMs and SERDs) on the cell transcriptome and behavior, in particular proliferation and ability to survive, and this might occur also by affecting BC stem cell–like properties, as demonstrated by Cho <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). These results suggested that DOT1L inhibition could be exploited to induce “antiestrogen-like” responses in tumor cells that acquired resistance to these drugs during hormonal therapies. By analyzing data relative to ERα<sup>+</sup> tumors present in TCGA, we observed that aggressive tumors, with a worse prognosis that almost invariably reflects in these cases resistance to endocrine therapy, show higher DOT1L expression, further supporting the clinical relevance and usefulness of targeting this enzyme in such tumors. This possibility was challenged here on several antiestrogen (both TAM and ICI)–resistant human BC cell models, and the results obtained both in vitro and in vivo confirm that targeting DOT1L to achieve inhibition of estrogen signaling, growth inhibition, and cell death represents an actionable option against ab initio or acquired endocrine therapy resistance in BCs. Razavi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>) recently showed in a large cohort of ERα<sup>+</sup> BC samples that hormone resistance arising after hormonal therapy is characterized by accumulation of mutations of <italic>ESR1</italic> or other genes of the receptor pathway in the tumor in ca. 20% of the cases and that mutations in these genes are significantly more common in metastases compared with primary tumors. Enrichment in these mutations was found mutually exclusive with regard to MAPK pathway genes (22% of the cases). Since the large majority of these ESR1 mutations affect receptor activity and responsiveness to ligands and the MAPK pathway activation is well known to cause phosphorylation of ERα, which thereby becomes constitutively active and insensitive to antiestrogens, it is not unexpected that in all cases, the patient fails to respond to endocrine therapy. The presence of a receptor abnormally active as a result of a structural variation caused by a mutation, or of posttranslational modifications induced by a deregulated signaling pathway, drives tumor progression with the same molecular mechanisms normally set in motion by estrogen, but insensitive to either agonist (estrogen hormones) or antagonist (TAM, ICI, etc.) ligands. In all these cases, representing a large fraction of endocrine therapy–resistant tumors, the possibility of silencing the ESR1 gene, clearing ERα from the cell, is a rational approach worth considering. DOT1L is particularly suitable to this aim, since several effective inhibitors of this enzyme are being actively investigated as potential anticancer drugs. A phase 1 clinical trial with the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ5676 used here in patients with MLL fusion gene–driven leukemia, for example, has recently ended, and the results confirmed the therapeutic potential of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>), although its efficacy as a single agent was modest. In this respect, we observed that cotreatment of MCF-7 cells with TAM and EPZ led to an additive effect of the two drugs (data not shown), a result not surprising in view of the common downstream target of both drugs, i.e., ERα, but of interest in view of the possibility to combine DOT1L inhibitors with endocrine therapy in such cases where a more effective blockade of estrogen signaling may be beneficial. If these studies yield positive results, repositioning DOT1L inhibitors for BC therapy could benefit from a substantial reduction in the time and costs necessary to evaluate their actual efficacy against these tumors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>MCF-7 (HTB-22), ZR-75.1 (CRL-1500), ZR-75.30 (CRL-150), T-47D (HTB-13), BT-474 (HTB-20), MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26), MDA-MB-468 (HTB-132), Hs 578T (HTB-126), HCC 1806 (CRL-2335), and MCF-10A (CRL-10317) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.

32042268	      <p id="Par69">LncRNAs were originally thought to be the “noise background” of transcription. As a deeper understanding of transcripts improved our knowledge of RNAs, an increasing number of cancer-related experiments have demonstrated that lncRNAs are important regulators with different mechanisms in PC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). However, there are still contradictory results for specific RNAs, which may be due to inconsistent models or different downstream targets and specific mechanisms to maintain the same phenotypes (listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>). In addition, the current study designs are mostly relatively simple, while comprehensive networks are much more difficult to fully investigate. Although significant effects have been observed at the cellular and organismal levels, many important issues regarding the complexity of lncRNAs remain to be resolved. Given their biological versatility, it is important to know whether lncRNAs are activated or silenced in any given tissue and how they perform their respective functions. Although we have begun to understand some of the effects of lncRNAs, new features remain unexplored, such as the positive and negative feedback regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA expression. Our current level of knowledge is still greatly limited by methodology, and additional progress is needed to develop appropriate approaches to enable researchers to study the structure and characterize the spatial and developmental specificity of lncRNAs. Other obstacles are based on the in vivo suppression or activation of lncRNAs. The lack of specific organ targets, susceptibility to degradation in cells and low efficiency of delivery are obstacles that still need to be overcome.<fig

We confirmed that green, Cre<sup>+</sup> cells stained negative for E-cad protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and E′</xref>) and that loss of E-cad was accompanied by loss of β-catenin from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, F and F′</xref>). In these genetic mosaic organoids, E-cad<sup>−</sup> cells were observed both basally at the cell–ECM interface and in interior positions apical to polarized E-cad<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D–F</xref>). The basally positioned E-cad<sup>−</sup> cells were frequently observed past the cell-derived basement membrane (laminin 332 immunofluorescence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, G and G′</xref>). E-cad<sup>+</sup> cells within the same organoid localized β-catenin to points of cell–cell contact and were inside the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E–G</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to identify adhesion systems that could allow epithelial cells to remain adherent despite loss of E-cad and membrane-localized β-catenin. Desmosomes represent a major class of intercellular junctions in mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bissell and Bilder, 2003</xref>). However, E-cad inhibition can induce reductions in both desmosomes and tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gumbiner et al., 1988</xref>). We therefore used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to quantify the effect of E-cad loss on intercellular junctions in organoids from <italic>E-cad<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>E-cad<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> littermates. We induced recombination with Adeno-Cre and focused our analysis on basally positioned cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). E-cad<sup>−</sup> cells typically lacked both punctate ZO-1 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) and ultrastructurally identifiable tight junctions. Compared with normal E-cad<sup>+</sup> epithelium, E-cad<sup>−</sup> epithelium also had a statistically significant, almost eightfold reduction in desmosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). However, we still detected small desmosomes connecting E-cad<sup>−</sup> cells, even within single file migration columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, J and J′</xref>). Collectively, our data reveal that loss of E-cad results in loss of simple epithelial architecture, reductions in multiple classes of cell–cell junctions, and both apical and basal exclusion of E-cad<sup>−</sup> cells from E-cad<sup>+</sup> simple epithelium. However, E-cad loss was not sufficient for robust single cell dissemination into the 3D ECM.</p></sec><sec><title>E-cad is required for branching morphogenesis in 3D culture</title><p>Normal mammary branching morphogenesis begins with a transition from simple to multilayered architecture and a concurrent reduction in apicobasal polarity and intercellular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ewald et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2012</xref>).

Specifically, they initiated and elongated numerous mammary buds and maintained a smooth border with the ECM. In contrast, E-cad<sup>−</sup> organoids did not undergo branching morphogenesis and instead rapidly developed a disorganized and uneven basal epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>; and Video 2). Cells at the basal ECM border were rounded and displayed extensive, uncoordinated motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C′</xref>).

Accordingly, we predicted that, in vivo, genetic mosaic <italic>E-cad</italic> deletion would result in exclusion of E-cad<sup>−</sup> cells from regions of active branching morphogenesis and accumulation of disorganized E-cad<sup>−</sup> cell groups both apically and basally.

We used genetic techniques to contrast deletion of the cell adhesion gene <italic>E-cad</italic> with expression of the EMT transcription factor <italic>Twist1</italic>. We focused on <italic>E-cad</italic> as it is frequently mutated in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berx et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirohashi, 1998</xref>), and loss of E-cad can synergize with loss of p53 to promote metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Derksen et al., 2006</xref>). In our experiments, <italic>E-cad</italic> deletion throughout the mammary epithelium resulted in loss of most intercellular junctions, loss of simple epithelial architecture, and inhibition of branching morphogenesis. However, E-cad<sup>+</sup> cells within genetic mosaic epithelium were able to initiate and elongate normal mammary buds in 3D culture and in vivo. The associated E-cad<sup>−</sup> cells were viable and remained adherent to each other but did not contribute to polarized luminal ducts. Therefore, mammary epithelial cells must be able to maintain contact through alternate adhesion systems such as desmosomal cadherins or protocadherins. We conclude that E-cad is required for normal mammary development but that its loss alone is not sufficient for robust dissemination.</p><p>We next evaluated the consequences of <italic>Twist1</italic> expression as Twist1 can regulate multiple aspects of metastasis and is thought to function primarily through <italic>E-cad</italic> repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peinado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vesuna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Our data reveal that <italic>Twist1</italic> expression is sufficient to induce normal epithelial cells to disseminate out of an epithelium, migrate through the ECM, and establish secondary epithelial sites. Surprisingly, the disseminating cells retained cytokeratin expression, and many displayed membrane-localized E-cad and β-catenin. Transcriptional profiling revealed essentially no changes in the RNA expression of epithelial-specific cadherins, catenins, or keratins. Instead, Twist1 regulated many genes that mediate cell–matrix adhesion or modify the extracellular compartment. Because Twist1 regulates distinct targets depending on its bHLH dimer partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes and Firulli, 2009</xref>), it is likely that its regulated genes vary in different experiments. However, because our experimental induction of <italic>Twist1</italic> was sufficient to induce dissemination, our 183 DE genes are likely particularly important in regulating the transition from adherent to motile epithelial cell phenotypes.</p><p>The conceptual framework for EMT was developed in response to classic experiments by Hay and co-workers in which definitive epithelial tissues lost polarity and disseminated as single cells into collagen I gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenburg and Hay, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hay and Zuk, 1995</xref>). The appearance of these cells was most similar to that of embryonic mesenchymal cells, leading to the concept of an EMT. We are observing a similar migration of cells out of an epithelial tissue and into the surrounding ECM. However, we do not observe a loss of epithelial-specific gene expression, and the migratory cells are readily able to reestablish epithelial organization, both spontaneously and after cessation of <italic>Twist1</italic> expression. Interestingly, we observed reductions in protein but not RNA levels of E-cad, β-catenin, and αE-catenin, suggesting posttranslational regulation of adherens junction components after <italic>Twist1</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reynolds, 2007</xref>). However, we demonstrated that complete KD of <italic>E-cad</italic> dramatically inhibited Twist1-induced single cell dissemination. We speculate that the exact protein levels of E-cad may critically regulate whether <italic>Twist1</italic> expression results in single cell dissemination or collective cell migration.</p><p>Accordingly, our data support the concept of a Twist1-dependent epithelial migratory program rather than a transition to mesenchymal cell fate or gene expression. Consistent with this framework, Twist1 regulates genes important for interactions with the stromal ECM environment. Our concept of an epithelial migratory program also finds support in breast cancer. Human breast tumors can express <italic>E-cad</italic> in both the primary tumor and in distant metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kowalski et al., 2003</xref>), and primary breast tumor cells positive for the EMT transcription factor Slug can express high levels of E-cad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Côme et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Most cancer therapies target the increased proliferation of cancer cells relative to normal tissues and not the cell behaviors driving invasion, dissemination, and metastasis. Few of these drugs have proven clinical benefit in metastatic breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carey, 2010</xref>). <italic>Twist1</italic> is overexpressed in multiple metastatic human cancers and appears to specifically regulate metastatic cell behaviors in multiple experimental cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Twist1 therefore represents an attractive conceptual target for developing anti-metastatic therapies. However, it is very difficult to target a transcription factor with small molecule therapeutics. Our observation that Twist1 regulates many proteins in the extracellular compartment suggests that there may be essential, druggable effectors downstream of Twist1 whose repression could inhibit dissemination. Our inducible mouse model revealed that disseminated single cells rapidly cease migration after loss of <italic>Twist1</italic> expression, suggesting that interfering with the Twist1 program could be an effective anticancer strategy. We envision our Twist1-induced dissemination assay as a rapid, reproducible, and scalable platform to build a new molecular model for effectors of Twist1 and to identify novel therapeutic compounds to antagonize cancer invasion and dissemination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mouse strains</title><p>The <italic>R26::Cre-ER</italic> mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badea et al., 2003</xref>) was a gift from J.

Organoids were embedded in 3D Matrigel (354230; BD) at 2–3 organoids/µl and plated as 100-µl suspensions in 24-well coverslip-bottomed plates (662892; Greiner Bio-One) over a 37°C heating block. Gels were allowed to polymerize for 30 min at 37°C and then cultured in organoid medium: DMEM with 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium (51500–056; Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P4333; Sigma-Aldrich). Basal organoid medium was used to induce cyst formation, whereas addition of 2.5 nM FGF2 (F0291; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to induce branching morphogenesis. Branching was scored as organoids with three or more elongated buds. Cysts were scored as unbranched organoids with lumens detectable by light microscopy. Dissemination was scored as organoids with one or more adjacent single cells that were clearly separated from the epithelial group.</p></sec><sec><title>Tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated deletion in 3D culture</title><p>Cre activity was induced in <italic>Cre-ER;E-cad<sup>fl/fl</sup>;mT/mG</italic> epithelium by culturing organoids overnight with 50 nM tamoxifen once embedded in Matrigel. To wash out tamoxifen, samples were rinsed with PBS, incubated in organoid medium for 20 min at 37°C, and then cultured in fresh organoid medium. The tamoxifen-inducible system resulted in Cre activity in almost all cells and did not affect branching morphogenesis in control organoids (e.g., <italic>Cre-ER;E-cad<sup>fl/+</sup>;mT/mG</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Adenoviral delivery of Cre recombinase</title><p>Before embedding in Matrigel, mammary organoids were infected with Adeno-Cre (1045; Vector Laboratories) at a ratio of ∼10<sup>7</sup> PFU per 1,000 organoids.

For all experiments, organoids were incubated at 37°C overnight in organoid medium with 2.5 nM FGF2 in HydroCell 96-well microplates (174907; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For Twist1 experiments, organoid medium was supplemented with 5 µg/ml doxycycline. The next day, organoids were resuspended in a 50% DMEM/50% Matrigel solution at a density of 20–40 organoids/µl and stored on ice. We conducted orthotopic transplantation into 3-wk-old NOD/SCID mice in a sterile hood. In brief, mice were anesthetized with 2–2.5% isoflurane and immobilized, and the surgical site was cleaned with ethanol. A 1-cm incision was made at the midline and a 0.5-cm incision was made from the midline to one hip. The skin was retracted to expose the no. 4 mammary gland. The no. 5 mammary fat pad and the region of the no. 4 mammary fat pad proximal to the lymph node were removed. The organoid suspension was loaded into a syringe (702RN [7636–01]; Hamilton; custom 1-in needles, 26 gauge), and 10–20 µl were injected into the cleared no. 4 fat pad. The skin was then locally infiltrated with 5–10 µl of 0.25% bupivacaine. The same procedure was repeated for the contralateral mammary gland. For each mouse, we transplanted control organoids (e.g., <italic>mT/mG</italic>) in one gland and experimental organoids (<italic>E-cad<sup>fl/fl</sup>;mT/mG</italic>, <italic>Cre-ER;E-cad<sup>fl/fl</sup>;mT/mG</italic>, or <italic>R26::LSL-rtTA;TRE-Twist1;mT/mG</italic>) in the other. The surface of the peritoneum was wet with PBS (without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and wounds were closed with 9-mm autoclips. Triple antibiotic ointment was applied to the incision site as needed. For Twist1 experiments, i.p. injections of 100 µg doxycycline in PBS (without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) were also performed at the time of surgery. <italic>Twist1</italic> activation in vivo was maintained with doxycycline feed (TD.01306; Harlan Laboratories). For deletion of <italic>E-cad</italic> in mature ductal networks, <italic>Cre-ER;E-cad<sup>fl/fl</sup>;mT/mG</italic> organoids were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice and allowed to grow for 6 wk. To induce <italic>E-cad</italic> deletion, we injected tamoxifen i.p. every other day for 5 d (three total injections) using a 1-ml syringe and a 30G1/2 needle (305106; BD). Each injection consisted of 100 µl of 10 mg/ml tamoxifen dissolved in sunflower seed oil. Glands were harvested 2–6 wk after injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy</title><p>Time-lapse imaging of mammary organoids was conducted using an LD Plan-Neofluar 20×/0.4 Korr Ph2 objective lens and a Cell Observer system with an AxioObserver Z1 and an AxioCam MRM camera (Carl Zeiss).

An LD C-Apochromat 40×/1.1 W Korr objective lens (Carl Zeiss) was used for high magnification single and time-lapse image acquisition, with water and oil used as the imaging mediums, respectively. Acquisition of both fixed and time-lapse images was performed using a combination of μManager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>) and Piper (Stanford Photonics, Inc.). For time-lapse imaging, images were collected at 20-min intervals for 2–4 d, and temperature was maintained at 37°C and CO<sub>2</sub> at 5%.

For antibody staining, samples were thawed at room temperature, rinsed twice in PBS for 10 min to remove OCT, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and rinsed twice in PBS for 10 min. Samples were blocked for 1–3 h with 10% FBS/1% BSA, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in 1% FBS/1% BSA, and rinsed three times in 1% FBS/1% BSA for 15 min. Incubation with secondary antibodies was conducted in 1% FBS/1% BSA overnight at 4°C or for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were rinsed three times in PBS for 10 min, mounted with Fluoromount (F4680; Sigma-Aldrich), and sealed with coverslips. F-Actin was stained with Alexa Fluor Phalloidin (1:100; Invitrogen), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:1,000; D3571; Invitrogen).

Immediately before use, lysis buffer was supplemented with 0.1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 3 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1.5 mM NaVO<sub>4</sub>, Aprotinin (A6279; Sigma-Aldrich), and a mini protease inhibitor tablet (11836153001; Roche). Organoids embedded in 3D Matrigel were collected using freshly made PBS/EDTA buffer (5 mM, 1 mM NaVO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM NaF, and 1 mM PMSF in PBS). Medium was aspirated from 3D culture wells, and all wells were rinsed once quickly with 1 ml of cold PBS. Approximately 1 ml of cold PBS/EDTA buffer was used to dissolve two 100-µl gels. Solutions were transferred to centrifuge tubes and mixed well by pipetting. Tubes were left on a 4°C shaker for 1 h to dissolve the Matrigel and then centrifuged at 400 rcf for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatants were removed and, if necessary, pellets were washed with additional PBS/EDTA to remove residual Matrigel. After another 5-min spin, pellets were resuspended in 100 µl of RIPA lysis buffer, vortexed, and left on ice for 30–40 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 18,400 rcf at 4°C and supernatants transferred to new centrifuge tubes and stored at −80°C. For lentivirus experiments, organoids were collected after 3-d puromycin selection, washed once with cold PBS to remove trace medium, and resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer as described.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Whole cell protein lysates were thawed on ice for 20 min, vortexed, and centrifuged for 5 min at 18,400 rcf at 4°C. Samples in Laemmli sample buffer (161–0747; Bio-Rad Laboratories) and β-mercaptoethanol were heated at 70°C for 10 min and loaded for equal protein based on bicinchoninic acid (BCA) analysis (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast gels (456–1084; Bio-Rad Laboratories). SDS-PAGE was performed at 40 V for 30 min and 80 V for ∼90 min until the dye front ran off the gels. Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (45-000-948; GE Healthcare) at 100 V for 1 h at 4°C. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST (03-500-537; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were prepared in blocking buffer and added overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies used were rat anti–E-cad (1:1,000; 13-1900; Invitrogen), rabbit anti–β-catenin (1:2,000; C2206; Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti–αE-catenin (1:1,000; ALX-804-101; Enzo Life Sciences), rabbit anti–N-cad (1:1,000; ab18203; Abcam), mouse anti-Twist1 (1:500; sc-81417; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and mouse anti–β-actin (1:1,000; A2228; Sigma-Aldrich). The N-cad antibody detected protein by Western blotting but not by immunofluorescence. Membranes were washed three times with TBST for 5 min and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000; Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were detected with ECL reagents (34075 or 34095; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and membranes were imaged using an imager and software (Alpha-InnoTec). Band intensities acquired under autoexposure were quantified using Fiji. To probe for more than one protein, membranes were incubated with stripping buffer (21059; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 37°C, washed three times with TBST for 5 min, and reblocked.

Lentiviral transduction particles were thawed on ice: (1) MISSION pLKO.1-puro <italic>Luciferase</italic> shRNA (10<sup>6</sup> TU/ml; SHC007V; Sigma-Aldrich); (2) MISSION pLKO.1-puro <italic>Cdh1</italic> shRNA #1 (10<sup>6</sup> TU/ml; TRCN0000042578; Sigma-Aldrich); (3) MISSION pLKO.1-puro <italic>Cdh1</italic> shRNA #2 (10<sup>6</sup> TU/ml; TRCN0000042581; Sigma-Aldrich). In separate centrifuge tubes, 3 µl of ViroMag R/L nanoparticles (RL40200; OZ Biosciences) were mixed with 47 µl of lentivirus and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. In three of the organoid wells, 150 µl of medium were carefully removed, and 50 µl of the ViroMag/lentivirus mix were added. Suspensions were mixed well to disperse the organoids and prevent aggregation. The fourth organoid well served as a no-virus, puromycin control to evaluate killing efficiency. The 96-well plate was incubated on top of a magnetic plate (MF10000; OZ Biosciences) at 37°C for 1.5 h and then taken off the magnet and incubated overnight at 37°C. On day 2, ∼70 µl of medium were removed from each well with virus, 200 µl of fresh organoid medium were added, and the suspensions were mixed well to redisperse the organoids. On day 3, ∼200 µl of medium were removed from all wells, and 200 µl of organoid medium with 2.5 nM FGF2 and 4 µg/ml puromycin were added. Selection was performed for 3 d, and the surviving virus-treated organoids were collected for 3D culture and imaged by DIC time-lapse microscopy. In parallel, <italic>TRE-Twist1</italic> (rtTA<sup>−</sup>) organoids from littermate controls were treated with lentiviruses and, after selection, used for protein extraction to evaluate <italic>E-cad</italic> KD efficiency. Time-lapse movies were used to track and count cells that had disseminated by 100 h of <italic>Twist1</italic> induction in each of the three treatment groups. A cell was considered disseminated if it had a clear space between itself and the main organoid (visible ECM) and was observed to be migrating away persistently.

These are then augmented to 4,722 curated gene sets by including gene lists from published studies, the L2L gene sets from mammalian microarray studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Newman and Weiner, 2005</xref>), the MYC Target Gene Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zeller et al., 2003</xref>), and other public resources. For each gene, including genes not differentially expressed at genome-wide significance, the p-value from DESeq was converted to the equivalent <italic>z</italic>-score for a two-sided test, with <italic>z</italic> &gt; 0 for Twist1 &gt; Control and <italic>z</italic> &lt; 0 for Twist1 &lt; Control. Each pathway was tested using a one-sided Student’s <italic>t</italic> test of |<italic>z</italic>| within pathway &gt; |<italic>z</italic>| outside pathway, corresponding to an increased number of DE genes without regard to direction (up or down in Twist1 versus Control). Significance thresholds for 0.05 family-wise error rates at the pathway level were estimated using 500 permutations of gene <italic>z</italic>-scores, recording the best p-value from each permutation, and taking the 25th-best p-value as the 0.05 FWER threshold. The resulting thresholds were 1.44 × 10<sup>−13</sup> for canonical gene sets and 5.31 × 10<sup>−19</sup> for curated gene sets. These thresholds are more stringent than a standard Bonferroni correction.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows that <italic>E-cad</italic> deletion results in complete loss of E-cad protein and reduced levels of other adherens junction components in 3D culture and in vivo.

Protein SYTL4 expression was similar to its mRNA expression pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>B). In tumors, the SYTL4 mRNA level was significantly lower in the basal-like subtype than luminal-like ones within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort.

31959826	        <p id="Par7">Since an inverse association between <italic>SPINK1</italic> expression and AR signaling was observed in three independent PCa cohorts (TCGA-PRAD, MSKCC and ours) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), we examined role of AR signaling in the regulation of SPINK1 using PCa cell lines, 22RV1 (endogenously SPINK1-positive) and androgen responsive VCaP cells (<italic>TMPRSS2-ERG</italic> fusion positive) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a, b</xref>). Stimulating 22RV1 cells with synthetic androgen, R1881 (10 nM), results in a significant decrease in expression of SPINK1 with a concomitant increase in the expression of AR target gene, <italic>KLK3</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a–c</xref>). A panel of SPINK1 positive and negative cancer cell lines were used to confirm the specificity of the SPINK1 antibody by immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>). To further investigate whether similar effect on SPINK1 expression could be rendered by sub-physiological concentration of androgen, 22RV1 cells were stimulated with much lower concentrations of R1881 (0.01 and 0.1 nM), and interestingly both ~0.1 nM and 1 nM of R1881 were equally efficacious in repressing the expression of <italic>SPINK1</italic> transcript (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). Similarly, VCaP cells stimulated with R1881 (10 nM) show a significant decline in the expression of SPINK1 both at transcript and protein levels, while an increase in the expression of <italic>KLK3</italic> was noticed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d–f</xref>). A remarkable decrease in the <italic>SPINK1</italic> expression was also noted even at sub-physiological concentration of androgen in VCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2e</xref>).

Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of these cells revealed a significant decrease in the expression of genes associated with androgen-signaling and positive enrichment of the pathways associated with neuron markers and axon guidance (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>), thus, emphasizing the probable role of SPINK1 in cellular plasticity and NE-like morphology.

Three separate microarray hybridizations were performed, using 22RV1-shSPINK1 cells against control 22RV1-shSCRM cells. For the microarray data Lowess (locally weighted regression) normalization was performed. The gene expression pattern for differentially regulated genes was identified using hierarchical clustering implemented Pearson coefficient correlation algorithm. Benjamini and Hochberg procedure was used to calculate FDR-corrected <italic>P</italic>-values (with FDR &lt; 0.05) to identify differentially expressed genes. Our analysis revealed 697 genes downregulated in 22RV1-shSPINK1 cells (log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt; 0.5 or &lt; −0.5, 90% confidence interval), which were further analyzed for enriched pathways (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery).

32403323	        <p>Our hypothesis predicts that the transcriptome in tumor tissue would be sufficiently distinct from the one in control normal tissue as a prerequisite for our intended meta-analysis. A principal component analysis of the selected datasets (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-11-00538">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) therefore served as an additional quality control confirming separation of the transcriptome between tumor sample and normal control in all selected individual studies. The data from Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-genes-11-00538">31</xref>] showed a somewhat less distinct separation of tumor versus normal transcriptome, but a clear enough difference to retain this study in our meta-analysis. Another study, GSE46905 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-genes-11-00538">32</xref>], which we had originally considered, was not taken forward because we could not find sufficiently clear separation between tumor and normal transcriptome (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-11-00538">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). </p>
32403323	        <p>We combined the transcriptomics data from these different studies in a meta-analysis, which provided an even clearer picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00538-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, we only carried out this meta-analysis with data sets from five of the six selected studies (having removed the data set with only a few patients and missing <italic>LEF1</italic> values, GSE46622 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-genes-11-00538">30</xref>]). This meta-analysis allowed us to tease out more clearly differences between tumor and normal tissue; with correlations between transcripts among these eight genes being mostly much stronger and clearer in normal control tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00538-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) and generally much weaker in tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00538-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,D). Positive correlations linking <italic>TCF7</italic> with <italic>LEF1</italic> and with <italic>LGR5</italic> in normal tissue are reduced in tumor tissue, and the negative correlation between <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>TCF7L1</italic> in normal tissue is also reduced in tumor tissue. The exception to this rule is a strengthened correlation between <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>TCF7</italic> expression in tumor tissue. Remarkably, our analysis also reveals that <italic>FZD7</italic> expression is strongly positively correlated with <italic>TCF7L1</italic> expression. Even more remarkably, this correlation is absent or much reduced in tumor tissue, and in the one study that has relevant information on kRAS mutant status in samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-genes-11-00538">27</xref>], it suggests that this correlation between <italic>TCF7L1</italic> and <italic>FZD7</italic> is particularly strong in KRAS-mutant normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00538-f002">Figure 2</xref>C), and is strongly reduced in KRAS mutant tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00538-f002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p>

The corresponding values are written in the column on the right: weight of the individual study in percent as part of the meta-analysis; standardized mean difference; and in square brackets confidence interval.

Values to the left of the midline indicated higher expression in the control relative to the tumor sample, e.g., see <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>LGR5</italic>. Individual studies with small sample size (i.e., few patients) as expected often have larger confidence intervals (therefore less reliability, e.g., see <italic>TCF7</italic> and <italic>LEF1</italic> data for GSE46622 study), but in the meta-analysis (in red) much tighter confidence intervals (therefore higher reliability).

Missing values in GSE46622 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-genes-11-00538">30</xref>] is due to low value data for <italic>LEF1</italic> in this study.

In contrast, the correlation between <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>TCF7</italic> expression is clearly more robust in tumor compared to normal tissue. Interestingly, the unearthed correlation between <italic>TCF7L1</italic> and <italic>FZD7</italic> expression appears to be dependent on wild-type <italic>kRAS</italic> in the tumor (compare <bold>D</bold> with <bold>F</bold>, yet not in normal control <bold>C</bold>).</p>

32143715	      <p id="Par19">In this study, we analyzed the genomic expression profiles of stem-like subtypes of CRC patient tissues possessing CSC characteristics using two gene expression data set (GSE13294; <italic>N</italic> = 125, GSE14333; <italic>N</italic> = 246) derived from resected primary CRC tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that the expression levels of the Wnt/β-catenin and RAS/MAPK signaling pathways target genes are highly increased in stem-like subtype of CRC patient tissues compared with other differentiated subtypes of CRC patients. In addition, both β-catenin and RAS protein, as well as the GTP-bound active RAS levels were also highly elevated in the CSC-like populations possessing stem cell characteristics compared with non-CSC like populations of CRC cell lines classified by fluorescent activating cell sorting (FACS). KYA1797K, a small molecule that destabilize both β-catenin and RAS by activating GSK3β via binding with Axin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], effectively suppressed the stemness of CRC spheroids with their growth inhibition.</p>

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using two differential gene expression profiles from CRC patient data sets (GSE13294; <italic>N</italic> = 125 and GSE14333; <italic>N</italic> = 246) showed that genes involved in the Wnt/β-catenin and RAS pathways are simultaneously elevated in stem-like subtype of CRC patient tumors that highly express stem cell-related gene signatures (GSE13294; <italic>N</italic> = 20 and GSE14333; <italic>N</italic> = 55) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] compared with other differentiated CRC patient tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>).

In addition, the CSC characteristic of CSC-like population was confirmed by their higher spheroid forming ability compared with non-CSC-population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1). β-catenin and RAS levels were highly elevated with activations of RAS downstream ERK and AKT kinases in CSC-like populations of CRC cell lines with various genetic backgrounds as shown by immunoblot analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>c). Moreover, significant increases in the GTP-RAS, the active form of RAS, were observed in the CSC-like populations (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S2), showing that the enriched RAS proteins in the CSC-like populations are active. These results suggest that β-catenin and RAS proteins would be effective molecular targets for suppressing the colorectal CSCs.

32203164	        <p id="Par11">To provide a mechanistic framework for the migration/invasion-related phenotypic alterations of <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-deficient cells we integrated our RNA-seq results with a query of the string database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This identified a molecular network that linked <italic>TCF7L2</italic> among others to the <italic>KLF4</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> transcription factor genes, the laminin subunit <italic>LAMB3</italic>, and the integrin genes <italic>ITGA3</italic>, <italic>ITGB7</italic>, and <italic>ITGBL1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). KLF4 suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], whereas RUNX2 and its target gene <italic>ITGBL1</italic> are pro-migratory and pro-metastatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Similarly, overexpression of <italic>ITGA3</italic> and <italic>ITGB7</italic> augments migration, matrix adhesion, and metastasis formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. ITGA3 additionally mediates collagen adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Interestingly, ITGA3 marks numerous cell protrusions in HCT116 <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells, which are not detected in <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>WT</sup> cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S13</xref>). We additionally confirmed that <italic>KLF4</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> were down- and upregulated, respectively, in HCT116 and HT29 <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>KO</sup> and <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>KOΔE6</sup> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b, c</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S14</xref>–<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S17</xref>). Furthermore, compared with <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>WT</sup> cells, expression of <italic>LAMB3</italic>, <italic>ITGBL1</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic>, and <italic>ITGB7</italic> was elevated in <italic>TCF7L2</italic>-deficient cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b, c</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S17</xref>), except for <italic>ITGBL1</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic>, and <italic>ITGB7</italic> whose transcript levels were largely unchanged in HT29 <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>KOΔE6</sup> cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S17</xref>). Possibly, TCF7L2 affects these genes only indirectly through intermediate regulatory steps which appear to be subject to clonal variation. We therefore focused on the robustly deregulated transcription factor genes <italic>KLF4</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic>, and investigated whether TCF7L2 directly regulates them. To identify potential TCF7L2-binding sites at the <italic>KLF4</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> loci, we explored existing TCF7L2 ChIP-seq datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which suggested the presence of one promoter-proximal and two intragenic TCF7L2-binding regions at the <italic>KLF4</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> loci, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S18</xref>). By ChIP-qPCR, however, we did not detect specific occupancy of the <italic>KLF4</italic> promoter region by TCF7L2 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S18a</xref>). In contrast, TCF7L2 associated with both <italic>RUNX2</italic> intragenic elements in <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>WT</sup> cells but not in <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S18b</xref>), thereby identifying <italic>RUNX2</italic> as a direct target gene that is repressed by TCF7L2 in HCT116 and HT29 CRC cells.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title><italic>TCF7L2</italic> deficiency disturbs a molecular network connected to migration and adhesion.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The string database was used to detect a regulatory network comprising several transcription factors and cell adhesion molecules.

For transcriptome analyses, extracted RNA was paired-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 at the Genome and Proteome Core Facility of the German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. Paired-end reads were filtered using Trimmomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Selected reads were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37. Read counts per gene were quantified with STAR aligner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. After excluding genes with low expression levels, 23,209 and 23,030 genes were considered for further processing for HCT116 and HT29 cells, respectively. For HT29, the two replicates for each of the five clones were integrated by averaging the corresponding number of counts. The differential expression analysis is based on a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution (DESeq2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. For each cell line, <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells were compared with <italic>TCF7L2</italic><sup>WT/Het</sup> cells.

From these sets of genes we determined the intersection of the significantly DEGs across the two cell lines.

For this, the stats R package was employed using a related set of background genes and the GO term collection “Biological Processes” as annotation. For the cell line-specific analyses, the 23,209 (HCT116 cells) and the 23,030 (HT29 cells) genes identified by applying the DESeq2 package, were taken as the background. For the overlapping gene set, the union of the top DEGs in both cell lines (i.e., 4602 genes) was taken as background. We calculated enriched GO terms for up- and downregulated genes separately, and retained GO terms with a significant adjusted <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.05 for both the cell line-specific calculations and the overlapped genes.

RNA-Seq library construction and sequencing was performed at Otogenetics Corporation (Atlanta, USA) according to standard protocols.

21772261	        <p>While VPA is attractive to study because of the need for identification of a target population for ongoing clinical trials, we also wanted to validate MATCH using a drug with a well-defined target population. Gene expression analysis on a data set of sensitive melanoma cells treated with a B-RAF inhibitor, PLX4032 (GSE20051) enabled generation of a genomic signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Joseph et al, 2010</xref>). Importantly, we use PLX4032 to validate the ability of our genomic approach to identify responsive cancers, as we know from clinical trials that PLX4032 has an 80% response rate in melanoma with mutant B-RAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Flaherty et al, 2010</xref>). A drug response signature was developed from treated and untreated cells using the approach detailed above. The signature for PLX4032 yielded a signature with 200 probes representing 157 unique genes. The heatmap and LOOCV graph for the B-RAF inhibitor signature are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref>. We then validated the ability of the B-RAF inhibitor signature to predict sensitivity in cancer cell lines, and show significant response in tumor cells with activating B-RAF mutations versus those without mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>).</p>
21772261	        <p>The VPA response signature was defined using the Connectivity Map build 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Lamb et al, 2006</xref>). The PLX4032 signature was defined using samples from GSE20051 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Joseph et al, 2010</xref>). A detailed description of the signature generation methods can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://io.genetics.utah.edu/files/bildres">http://io.genetics.utah.edu/files/bildres</ext-link>. In brief, Mas5 normalized gene expression data from the Connectivity Map website were log normalized and then used as the training set in the analysis. Each data set was also Mas5 normalized and then log transformed. Following normalization, signature and data sets were quantile normalized, and 25% of probes on the microarrays with the lowest expression and lowest variability were prefiltered from the analysis. Distance weighted discrimination standardization was used to correct for batch effects between data sets. A Bayesian binary regression algorithm was then used on the training set to generate a list of probes and weights relative to the first principle component for calculating a metagene score that is then converted to a probability. The probability output from the binary regression model was subtracted from one, so that probabilities closer to one indicated higher probability of sensitivity to the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bild et al, 2006</xref>). Parameters were optimized to minimize the <italic>P</italic>-value for a <italic>t</italic>-test comparing the predictions of the treated and untreated samples in the training set in the LOOCV analysis. To compare independently collected and processed data sets, we log normalized and then linearly transformed the binary regression output for each data set and for each signature to span from 0 to 1.

All data were mas5 normalized, and samples with a ratio &gt;3 between probes at the 3′ and 5′ end of GAPDH were considered potentially degraded and excluded from further analysis. We excluded sarcomas and hematopoietic malignancies from our analysis as our signatures are generated with epithelial cells. VPA sensitivity predictions were then generated as described above. For duplicate and triplicate samples in the GSK panel, final predictions were averaged.</p>
21772261	        <p>Breast cancer samples from 11 microarray studies were employed in this analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Duplicate samples from GEO data sets gse6532, gse7390, and gse3494 and cell line and normal samples from gse7904 were removed. As not all public data sets had clinical annotations, intrinsic breast cancer subtypes were assigned as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Sorlie et al, 2001</xref>). Briefly, a training set of 259 samples representing the five subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-overexpressing, basal-like, and normal-like) and 306 genes were used to build a corresponding set of five centroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Hu et al, 2006</xref>). Features were assigned using Entrez Gene identifiers and duplicate identifiers were collapsed to the mean. Each test case was then compared with the five standardized centroids using Spearman's rank correlation and assigned the subtype of the nearest centroid.</p>

32694827	          <p id="P61">Data from real tumor samples available via the CBioPortal Database (most updated TCGA data for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma patients) reflects the genomic and transcriptomic profile of a mixed population of cells in the TME. In order to compare the transcriptomic signatures of cancer cells and stromal cells (cancer-associated fibroblasts, CAFs) in the TCGA data we developed a method to classify tumor samples as stromal-dominant and epithelial-dominant to represent CAFs and cancer cells. We used putative stromal and epithelial markers to cluster stromal- and epithelial-dominant samples. We performed k-means clustering using gene expression of 7 epithelial markers (CDH1, EPCAM, KRT7/8/10/18/19) and 46 myofibroblast markers (ACTA2, IL1R1, FAP, CCN2, ACTN1, CSF2RA, COL5A1, ITGB2, ITGAV, TIMP2, ADAM12, COL6A3, MMP9, FN1, PDGFC, COL1A2, COL6A2, FBN1, MMP2, MMP14, PLAU, PECAM1, CD93, CXCL12, SPRY1, ERG, ROBO4, TNXB, ACAN, CHI3L1, COL4A2, COMP, EFEMP2, FBLN1, FBLN2, FBN1, FBN2, IMPG2, ANOS1, LAMA4, LAMB1, LAMC1, MATN3, MFAP5, MGP, PRELP) to cluster samples into three or four clusters. The clustering on the tumor gene expression was performed to identify tumor samples that showed a dominant epithelial signature to represent cancer cell populations, and a dominant fibroblast signature to represent CAF cell populations. Since patient tumor samples are heterogeneous, containing cells other than malignant and CAF cells, we employ unsupervised k-means clustering based on epithelial and stromal markers alone. We account for “mixed” clusters, which represent samples that do not fall into either of the epithelial or stromal clusters. We tune the number of clusters, “k”, for the algorithm to pick out patient samples with distinct epithelial and CAF signatures. Performance of the k-means clustering is verified by assessing the distribution of samples with respect to their average stromal gene expression and average epithelial gene expression. Finally, expression of genes involved in branched-chain amino acid metabolism (BCAT1/2, BCKDHA/B, DBT and DLD) were compared across the clustered samples using a two-tailed t-test. ROBO1 expression was also compared across the clusters to independently validate the performance of clustering, since the ROBO1 gene is known to be highly expressed in stromal cells. The same methodology is employed for microarray data for PDAC tumor samples available from GSE21501, GSE36924 and GSE62165 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, as well as RNASeq for healthy tissue (GTEx Analysis v8) from the GTEx Portal accessed on 08/29/2019.

These processes are spatially and temporally regulated to preserve the homoeostasis of tissues and involve the interplay of different cell types. Aberrations in ECM remodelling play a profound role in the development and progression of cancer. Due to their expression in specific pathologies, these ECM alterations can be used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets, for example, by using nanobody technology, which can selectively detect these alterations in vivo and guide therapeutics to the specific location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">246</xref></sup>.

Different immune cells significantly contribute to changes in the ECM and are also functionally affected by these changes.

31772275	        <p id="Par7">To identify potential deregulated genes in CRC tumorigenesis, we examined the microarray gene expression profile of colorectal cancer tissues from patients with newly diagnosed CRC versus adjacent normal tissues. A comparison of the gene expression changes in CRC patients indicated that ILF3 was among the top 50 genes upregulated in tumor cells when compared with adjacent normal cells from CRC patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a–c</xref>). Further analysis of 34 paired samples of colon cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa again and various cell lines revealed that CRC exhibits high ILF3 levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>; Supplementary information, Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). In addition, analysis of the mRNA expression data from the colon cancer set GSE9348 and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrated that the ILF3 expression level was higher in cancer tissue than in normal tissue (Supplementary information, Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b and c</xref>). Notably, ILF3 expression is also elevated in many types of human tumors in addition to CRC (Supplementary information, Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1d</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining of ILF3 in tissue microarrays (<italic>n</italic> = 79) revealed that ILF3 expression in CRC is higher than normal tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>, f). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that high ILF3 levels were correlated with poor overall survival in three independent cohorts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g–i</xref>). The testing cohort included paired CRC and normal colon tissue samples from 79 patients. The validation cohorts included CRC samples from 270 patients and 134 patients, respectively. High ILF3 expression was positively correlated with advanced clinical stage (Supplementary information, Table S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">1</xref>). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that ILF3 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival (Supplementary information, Table S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Identification of ILF3 as a poor prognosis marker in CRC. <bold>a</bold> Principal component analysis of microarrays from three paired CRC and normal tissue samples.

31772275	        <p id="Par9">To further identify the roles of ILF3 in colorectal cancer, we performed transcriptomic analysis in ILF3-knockdown (KD) DLD1 cells. Notably, gene ontology analysis data indicated that there are significant differences between the ILF3-KD cells and control cells in multiple metabolism-related pathways, including networks that connect glycolytic intermediates to serine–glycine one-carbon cycle (SGOC) metabolism (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> For example, folate metabolism and the serine–glycine pathway scored high among the induced pathways. We then performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to figure out the association between expression of ILF3 and signaling pathways in two sets of colon cancer GSE5206 and GSE17538. We found that ILF3 was positively correlated with KEGG one-carbon folate pathway (Supplementary information, Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3a and b</xref>). Furthermore, there was an enrichment of a 64-gene signature defining the entire SGOC network in the presence of high ILF3 in GSEA of the colon cancer set GSE29621, indicating coordinated activation of the network by ILF3 (Supplementary information, Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3c</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Activation of de novo serine biosynthesis in ILF3-dependent CRC. <bold>a</bold> Gene categories significantly (<italic>P</italic> <italic>≤</italic> 0.05) enriched for genes deregulated in metabolism, owing to knockdown of ILF3 in the CRC cell line DLD1. <bold>b</bold> Gene abundance of the serine biosynthesis pathway after knockdown of ILF3 using shRNA.

33050144	      <p>One of the most detailed kinetic models of GSH metabolism was presented by Reed et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B168-biomolecules-10-01429">168</xref>]. This model provides mathematical representation of one-carbon metabolism, the trans-sulfuration pathway, and GSH synthesis, transport, and breakdown and takes into consideration three compartments—blood, cytosol, and mitochondria with kinetic of reactions as well as transport between compartments. Reed’s model does not include all reactions in GSH metabolism and for several reactions fits parameters to experimental data available at the time, making the model context specific. However, with links between 10 metabolites in 13 reactions simulated using detailed kinetic equations, Reed’s model (available at Biomodels: BIOMD0000000268) is an excellent basis for further development of computer simulations of GSH metabolism for different applications. An interesting example of an extension to Reed’s GSH metabolism model has been presented by Kelly et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169-biomolecules-10-01429">169</xref>] with the addition of quinone redox metabolism to the GSH model. With this addition, glutathione’s role in mitigating toxicity from quinone-derivatives is combined with its overall kinetics providing a link between glutathione depletion in different compartments with quinone redox. Doxorubicin, one of the most important chemotherapy drugs that functions by blocking topo-isomerase 2 is a quinone containing compound. Doxorubicin causes significant dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, possibly due to futile redox cycling. Cellular GSH is a major defense against the redox cycling-derived oxidative stress and therefore a detailed model of glutathione-quinone interplay is of great interest to cancer treatment and analysis of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B169-biomolecules-10-01429">169</xref>].</p>

23925389	<bold>Method:</bold> Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using the HDAC 1–6 antibodies on 50 chordoma samples (34 primary tumours, 16 recurrences) from 44 patients (27 male, 17 female). Pan-HDAC inhibitors Vorinostat (SAHA), Panobinostat (LBH-589), and Belinostat (PXD101) were tested for their efficacy in the chordoma cell line MUG-Chor1 via Western Blot, cell cycle analysis, caspase 3/7 activity, caspase-3, and PARP cleavage. <italic>P</italic>-values below 0.05 were considered significant.</p>

27553392	<bold>Objective:</bold> Oncogenesis is a multistep process, resulting from the accumulations of multiple mutations. Of these mutations, disruption of cell growth regulation is the first episode. Nonetheless, the genes associated with cell growth dysregulation have seldom been systematically evaluated in either urothelial carcinomas of upper urinary tract (UTUC) or of urinary baldder (UBUC). By data mining a published transcriptomic dataset of UBUCs (GSE31684), we identified NDN as one of the most significantly upregulated gene associated with advanced tumour status and metastatic disease among those associated with the regulation of cell growth (GO:0001558).</p>
27553392	<bold>Objective:</bold> By subjecting a documented transcriptome dataset of urothelial carcinoma of bladder (GSE31684) to data mining and focusing on genes linked to peptidase activity (GO:0008233), we recognized C1S as the most significantly upregulated gene related to more aggressive disease. We subsequently analyzed the association of both C1S mRNA and protein expression with the clinical and pathological significance.</p>
27553392	<bold>Objective:</bold> Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a type of tumour, especially of the urinary bladder, that affects people worldwide. Clarification of its detailed tumour biology and discovery of potential targets for developing treatment strategies are imperative because of frequent recurrences and poor prognosis of advanced UCs. By data mining a published dataset of UC of bladder (UCB) transcriptome (GSE31684) from Gene Expression Omnibus, we identified that THBS2 was the most significantly upregulated gene among those related to structural molecule activity (GO:0005198).</p>

In contrast, high expression of the Wnt-receptor signature predicted poor outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>), an association that was further validated in an independent cohort (<ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" ns1:href="GSE39582">GSE39582</ext-link>; 265 cases) for both relapse-free and overall survival (Fig. S5, A–D). We then studied published signatures for CMS2 and CMS4 tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linnekamp et al., 2018</xref>) and found a similar, mutually exclusive association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>; and Fig. S5, E–H). To determine the overlap between these expression-based classifications, we correlated the assignment of tumors to high and low expression groups. This analysis revealed that <italic>APC</italic>-KO and Wnt-receptor signatures indeed mark two sets of patients that correlate with CMS2 and CMS4 tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). This notion was further supported by GSEA of CMS2 and CMS4 gene signatures that displayed highly significant enrichment for the intrinsic and extrinsic responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, F and G</xref>). Together, our results reveal that oncogenic and physiological Wnt responses represent two independent and opposing prognostic determinants in CRC.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>The Wnt-receptor signature is associated with poor prognosis and overlaps with CMS4 tumors.

Here, we report the first comprehensive profiling that stratifies between Wnt responses in normal human colon and adenoma cells. The usage of isogenic organoid pairs has allowed us to normalize for donor-specific heterogeneity and to identify novel tumor and putative stem cell markers that were validated in human tissues. The described strategy permits to better differentiate the signaling activities in human CRC and link them to distinct tumor and prognostic subtypes.</p><p>Organoids provide an accessible model to dissect signals induced by the extrinsic culture environment or intrinsic activation after genetic manipulation. By comparing normal and <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells in the presence of Wnt-containing medium, we could normalize the physiological stimulation to obtain an oncogene-specific signature. Importantly, we report that constitutive signaling induces distinct responses compared with receptor-mediated activation. Because <italic>APC</italic> is lost in the majority of CRC cases, proteins identified and validated in this study could represent a set of sensitive new biomarkers (Table S4). Among this list, several proteins have enzymatic activity and could serve as therapeutic targets, which should be addressed in further studies. We suggest that a similar profiling strategy in organoids could allow identification of tumor-specific traits for other oncogenic deregulations that commonly hijack signaling pathways critical for normal cell physiology (e.g., KRAS, PI3K, NOTCH).</p><p>Another important finding is the considerable heterogeneity between normal organoids from different donors that was observed both on the transcriptome and proteome level. Previous studies have shown separate clustering of normal/adenoma and carcinoma organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van de Wetering et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cristobal et al., 2017</xref>). However, this dissimilarity might lead to an underestimation of the actual variation among normal organoids that largely exceeded the effect of Wnt stimulation or <italic>APC</italic> loss. Genetic differences such as expression quantitative trait loci might account for this individual variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kilpinen et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, preserved expression of gut region-specific genes might be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Middendorp et al., 2014</xref>), although our analysis suggests to a minor extent (Fig. S2 A). Irrespective of the source of this individual variation, we conclude that bulk comparisons of tumor and normal samples have limited power to identify single gene/mutation effects. Paired analysis of engineered organoids can circumvent this problem and provide a sensitive approach to extract pathway or mutational signatures that are valid across a heterogeneous population.</p><p>We report two mutually exclusive Wnt signatures in normal and <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells, a distinction that was not feasible using previous signatures derived from either stem cells or primary adenomas. The most likely explanation for this lack of definition is the close association between Wnt signaling, stemness and tumorigenesis: mouse adenomatous crypts show increased β-catenin expression and consequently expand their stem cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schepers et al., 2012</xref>). A tumor-normal comparison, thus, always includes direct and indirect effects. Likewise, differential comparison of stem cells and daughter cells detects alterations in other pathways (e.g., NOTCH), as well as the induction of differentiation genes. We aimed to normalize these confounding effects by extrinsic stimulation in order to extract the tumor-specific signaling component. The identified signatures were preserved after variation of the level of extrinsic and intrinsic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), indicating that the divergent responses are caused by qualitative rather than quantitative changes in Wnt signaling. In support, our signatures were differentially enriched in <italic>RNF43</italic> and <italic>APC</italic> mutant CRC (Fig. S2, G and H), which are driven by upstream and downstream pathway activity. Alternatively, ligand-dependent activation may not activate the pathway to the same extent as truncation of <italic>APC</italic>. Remarkably, we could observe only limited gene expression changes in <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells after Wnt/R-spondin stimulation (Fig. S2 C), indicating that canonical responses are saturated and that noncanonical transcriptional Wnt responses are negligible in our experimental system. In addition, the multiple layers of negative feedback regulation (e.g., by AXIN2, NKD1, RNF43, DKKs) could cause the limited response in <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells. On the proteomic level, the changes in <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells were more prominent (Fig. S3 B), indicating that posttranslational regulation, e.g., protein stabilization by Wnt-STOP signaling, could be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acebron et al., 2014</xref>) that is independent of nuclear CTNNB1 function. Differential phospho-proteomic analyses could provide further mechanistic insights in future. In our analyses, we have only found a few genes that were shared between intrinsic and extrinsic responses. Interestingly, these genes were enriched for known stem cell markers such as <italic>LGR5</italic> and <italic>ASCL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). As an in vivo correlate, we have identified adenoma-induced proteins AMACR and PPIP5K2 that also showed highly crypt bottom-specific expression in the normal colon. We conclude that stem cell markers are either characterized by a particular dose sensitivity to Wnt, or dependent on additional signals that are induced in a secondary manner both upon Wnt stimulation and in adenomas.</p><p>CRC subtypes with high Wnt-activity have been previously associated with a favorable prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Sousa E Melo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Sousa E Melo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>). It is plausible that this indicates resemblance to benign adenomas that are driven by <italic>APC</italic> loss and that more malignant carcinomas gradually lose Wnt profiles. In contrast, other reports have associated intestinal stem cell profiles with high risk of relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marisa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sadanandam et al., 2013</xref>), where presence of Wnt-active tumor stem cells could reflect increased invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brabletz et al., 2001</xref>) and therapy resistance. These two opposing concepts emphasize a need to better understand the biology that underlies the consensus CRC subtypes. We postulate that rather than Wnt activity per se, stratification of specific downstream responses is more informative on the tumor status. Association of our <italic>APC</italic>-KO signature with good prognosis and the canonical subtype (CMS2) is fully consistent with the dominant role of <italic>APC</italic> mutations in these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>). However, we found that increased receptor-mediated signaling is linked to poor prognosis in CMS4 tumors that are also rich in mesenchymal stroma. Whether this activity represents cell-autonomous expression in tumor cells, e.g., induced by the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>), or activation in stromal cells remains to be addressed. It appears unlikely that this expression is caused by <italic>RNF43</italic> deficiency, which is mainly found in microsatellite instable tumors (CMS1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giannakis et al., 2014</xref>), or the more rare R-spondin translocations that also remain dependent on external Wnt signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Storm et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, our findings may help to reconcile how the “stem-like” tumor subtype (described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sadanandam et al., 2013</xref>) can combine malignancy with expression of specific Wnt targets. Future experiments should reveal if interference with receptor-mediated Wnt activity might allow the modulation of invasiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Patient samples</title><p>Normal human colon organoid lines were derived from nonpathological mucosa that was collected after prior written informed consent either during preemptive colonoscopy or from tumor-adjacent normal colon after tumor resection (Fig. S1 A).

Binding of Wnt to Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6 coreceptors results in β-catenin (CTNNB1) stabilization, nuclear import, and transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes. In the absence of Wnt ligands, the cytoplasmic destruction complex that contains Adenoma polyposis coli (APC), AXIN1/2, the serine/threonine kinases GSK3B, and CSNK1A1 mediates CTNNB1 phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>). Several mutations have been identified that result in ligand-independent CTNNB1 stabilization in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhan et al., 2017</xref>). In colorectal cancer (CRC), truncating <italic>APC</italic> mutations are most frequent and can be found in ∼80% of all patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>).

Principal component analysis (PCA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) showed that the variability of gene expression between donor lines largely exceeded the biological effects. However, this variability was small compared with the major transcriptional changes observed between normal organoids and paired CRC-derived organoids (Fig. S2, A and B). Thus, while a comparison of tumor and normal samples usually results in two discrete expression clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van de Wetering et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cristobal et al., 2017</xref>), the individual variability between normal organoids exceeds the effects induced by a single oncogenic hit such as <italic>APC</italic>-KO. To normalize for this donor-dependent variability, we performed paired differential analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

Previous transcriptome-based CRC classification has revealed active Wnt signaling in CMS2 tumors that have favorable prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>). To further differentiate this Wnt response in CRC, we performed Kaplan–Meier analysis after bifurcation according to the combined expression of the top 16 transcripts of each of our signatures (Table S1, A and B). In an age-, gender-, and stage-adjusted cohort (<ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" ns1:href="GSE14333">GSE14333</ext-link>; 187 cases), we found that tumors characterized by high expression of the <italic>APC</italic>-KO signature indeed displayed significantly prolonged relapse-free survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). In contrast, high expression of the Wnt-receptor signature predicted poor outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>), an association that was further validated in an independent cohort (<ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" ns1:href="GSE39582">GSE39582</ext-link>; 265 cases) for both relapse-free and overall survival (Fig. S5, A–D). We then studied published signatures for CMS2 and CMS4 tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linnekamp et al., 2018</xref>) and found a similar, mutually exclusive association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>; and Fig. S5, E–H).

This notion was further supported by GSEA of CMS2 and CMS4 gene signatures that displayed highly significant enrichment for the intrinsic and extrinsic responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, F and G</xref>).

Here, we report the first comprehensive profiling that stratifies between Wnt responses in normal human colon and adenoma cells. The usage of isogenic organoid pairs has allowed us to normalize for donor-specific heterogeneity and to identify novel tumor and putative stem cell markers that were validated in human tissues. The described strategy permits to better differentiate the signaling activities in human CRC and link them to distinct tumor and prognostic subtypes.</p><p>Organoids provide an accessible model to dissect signals induced by the extrinsic culture environment or intrinsic activation after genetic manipulation. By comparing normal and <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells in the presence of Wnt-containing medium, we could normalize the physiological stimulation to obtain an oncogene-specific signature. Importantly, we report that constitutive signaling induces distinct responses compared with receptor-mediated activation. Because <italic>APC</italic> is lost in the majority of CRC cases, proteins identified and validated in this study could represent a set of sensitive new biomarkers (Table S4). Among this list, several proteins have enzymatic activity and could serve as therapeutic targets, which should be addressed in further studies. We suggest that a similar profiling strategy in organoids could allow identification of tumor-specific traits for other oncogenic deregulations that commonly hijack signaling pathways critical for normal cell physiology (e.g., KRAS, PI3K, NOTCH).</p><p>Another important finding is the considerable heterogeneity between normal organoids from different donors that was observed both on the transcriptome and proteome level. Previous studies have shown separate clustering of normal/adenoma and carcinoma organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van de Wetering et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cristobal et al., 2017</xref>). However, this dissimilarity might lead to an underestimation of the actual variation among normal organoids that largely exceeded the effect of Wnt stimulation or <italic>APC</italic> loss. Genetic differences such as expression quantitative trait loci might account for this individual variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kilpinen et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, preserved expression of gut region-specific genes might be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Middendorp et al., 2014</xref>), although our analysis suggests to a minor extent (Fig. S2 A). Irrespective of the source of this individual variation, we conclude that bulk comparisons of tumor and normal samples have limited power to identify single gene/mutation effects. Paired analysis of engineered organoids can circumvent this problem and provide a sensitive approach to extract pathway or mutational signatures that are valid across a heterogeneous population.</p><p>We report two mutually exclusive Wnt signatures in normal and <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells, a distinction that was not feasible using previous signatures derived from either stem cells or primary adenomas. The most likely explanation for this lack of definition is the close association between Wnt signaling, stemness and tumorigenesis: mouse adenomatous crypts show increased β-catenin expression and consequently expand their stem cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schepers et al., 2012</xref>). A tumor-normal comparison, thus, always includes direct and indirect effects. Likewise, differential comparison of stem cells and daughter cells detects alterations in other pathways (e.g., NOTCH), as well as the induction of differentiation genes. We aimed to normalize these confounding effects by extrinsic stimulation in order to extract the tumor-specific signaling component. The identified signatures were preserved after variation of the level of extrinsic and intrinsic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), indicating that the divergent responses are caused by qualitative rather than quantitative changes in Wnt signaling. In support, our signatures were differentially enriched in <italic>RNF43</italic> and <italic>APC</italic> mutant CRC (Fig. S2, G and H), which are driven by upstream and downstream pathway activity. Alternatively, ligand-dependent activation may not activate the pathway to the same extent as truncation of <italic>APC</italic>. Remarkably, we could observe only limited gene expression changes in <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells after Wnt/R-spondin stimulation (Fig. S2 C), indicating that canonical responses are saturated and that noncanonical transcriptional Wnt responses are negligible in our experimental system. In addition, the multiple layers of negative feedback regulation (e.g., by AXIN2, NKD1, RNF43, DKKs) could cause the limited response in <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells. On the proteomic level, the changes in <italic>APC</italic>-KO cells were more prominent (Fig. S3 B), indicating that posttranslational regulation, e.g., protein stabilization by Wnt-STOP signaling, could be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acebron et al., 2014</xref>) that is independent of nuclear CTNNB1 function. Differential phospho-proteomic analyses could provide further mechanistic insights in future. In our analyses, we have only found a few genes that were shared between intrinsic and extrinsic responses. Interestingly, these genes were enriched for known stem cell markers such as <italic>LGR5</italic> and <italic>ASCL2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). As an in vivo correlate, we have identified adenoma-induced proteins AMACR and PPIP5K2 that also showed highly crypt bottom-specific expression in the normal colon. We conclude that stem cell markers are either characterized by a particular dose sensitivity to Wnt, or dependent on additional signals that are induced in a secondary manner both upon Wnt stimulation and in adenomas.</p><p>CRC subtypes with high Wnt-activity have been previously associated with a favorable prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Sousa E Melo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Sousa E Melo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>). It is plausible that this indicates resemblance to benign adenomas that are driven by <italic>APC</italic> loss and that more malignant carcinomas gradually lose Wnt profiles. In contrast, other reports have associated intestinal stem cell profiles with high risk of relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marisa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sadanandam et al., 2013</xref>), where presence of Wnt-active tumor stem cells could reflect increased invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brabletz et al., 2001</xref>) and therapy resistance. These two opposing concepts emphasize a need to better understand the biology that underlies the consensus CRC subtypes. We postulate that rather than Wnt activity per se, stratification of specific downstream responses is more informative on the tumor status. Association of our <italic>APC</italic>-KO signature with good prognosis and the canonical subtype (CMS2) is fully consistent with the dominant role of <italic>APC</italic> mutations in these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>). However, we found that increased receptor-mediated signaling is linked to poor prognosis in CMS4 tumors that are also rich in mesenchymal stroma. Whether this activity represents cell-autonomous expression in tumor cells, e.g., induced by the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>), or activation in stromal cells remains to be addressed. It appears unlikely that this expression is caused by <italic>RNF43</italic> deficiency, which is mainly found in microsatellite instable tumors (CMS1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giannakis et al., 2014</xref>), or the more rare R-spondin translocations that also remain dependent on external Wnt signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Storm et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, our findings may help to reconcile how the “stem-like” tumor subtype (described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sadanandam et al., 2013</xref>) can combine malignancy with expression of specific Wnt targets. Future experiments should reveal if interference with receptor-mediated Wnt activity might allow the modulation of invasiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Patient samples</title><p>Normal human colon organoid lines were derived from nonpathological mucosa that was collected after prior written informed consent either during preemptive colonoscopy or from tumor-adjacent normal colon after tumor resection (Fig. S1 A).

First, the peptides were desalted on a reverse phase C18 precolumn (5 × 0.3 mm diameter). After 3 min, the precolumn was switched online with the analytical column (30 cm long, 75 µm inner diameter) prepared in-house using ReproSil-Pur C18 AQ 1.9 µm reversed phase resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH). The peptides were separated with a linear gradient of 5–35% buffer (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min (with back pressure of 500 bars) over 90-min gradient time. The precolumn and column temperature were set to 50°C during the chromatography. The MS data were acquired by scanning the precursors in a mass range from 350 to 1,600 m/z at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200.

30979792	      <p>Neither a kinase‐centric nor a substrate‐centric phosphorylation analysis may suffice by itself to optimally single out major activated (driver) kinase(s) of cancer cells. To achieve an optimized ranking of inferred kinase activities based on MS‐derived phosphoproteomics data for single samples, we propose a multipronged, rather than a singular approach. In this study, we devised a phosphoproteomics analysis tool for prioritizing active kinases in single samples, called Integrative Inferred Kinase Activity (INKA) scoring. The INKA algorithm combines direct observations on phosphokinases (either all kinase‐derived phosphopeptides or activation loop peptides specifically), with observations on phosphoproteins that are known or predicted substrates for the pertinent kinase. To demonstrate its utility, we analyzed (i) cancer cell lines with known driver kinases in a single‐sample manner, (ii) cell lines in a differential setting (wild‐type versus mutant, +/− drug), (iii) pre‐ and on‐treatment tumor needle biopsies from cancer patients, (iv) cancer cell panels with available drug sensitivity data, encouraging further exploration of INKA's functional and clinical value, and (v) colorectal cancer patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) samples with INKA‐guided drug selection. INKA code is available through a web server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.INKAscore.org">www.INKAscore.org</ext-link> (updating) and as a zip file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="msb188250-sup-0007">Code EV1</xref>, current version). Data are available under PXD006616, PXD008032, PXD012565, and PXD009995.</p>
30979792	        <p>To expand application of INKA, we added a script to import phosphoproteomics data that include isobaric (tandem mass tag, TMT) labeling. The publicly available 11‐plex TMT dataset PXD009477 of ALK signaling in the neuroblastoma cell line NB1 (Emdal <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0014">2018</xref>) was re‐analyzed using INKA. Upon inhibition of NB1 by ALK‐targeting siRNA or the ALK inhibitor lorlatinib, a reduction in the INKA score of ALK by 50% was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="msb188250-sup-0001">Appendix Fig S14</xref>). Additionally, INKA scores of MAPK pathway members MAP2K1, MAP2K2, MAPK1, and MAPK3 were reduced, indicating ALK‐MAPK network crosstalk. Other kinases, including AKT2, RPS6KB1, and RET, showed similar behavior.</p>
30979792	        <p>To assess the global correlation of INKA with cell line drug efficacy data, we analyzed our cell line use cases (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msb188250-fig-0002">2</xref>) along with two cancer cell panels, with publicly available label‐free phosphoproteomics data (Piersma <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0043">2015</xref>; van der Mijn <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0053">2015</xref>; Humphrey <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0023">2016</xref>) and associated drug IC50 data with drug–kinase relationships (Karaman <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0026">2008</xref>; Davis <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0012">2011</xref>; Iorio <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0024">2016</xref>; Klaeger <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0027">2017</xref>). To this end, we developed an algorithm that takes into account drug IC50 values for different cell lines and provides a global metric for association of drug efficacy and kinase activity ranking. We asked which kinase ranking tool, INKA, its four components, or KARP, correlates kinase activities best with drug efficacy data. Both TiO<sub>2</sub> capture data (CRC, PXD001550; Piersma <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0043">2015</xref>) and pTyr antibody capture data (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDAC; PXD003198; Humphrey <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0023">2016</xref>) were included. First, for each method, kinase scores were divided by their maximum value, resulting in a normalized kinase activity score (KAS) for each of the ranked kinases. Second, for each cell line, drug −logIC50 values (e<sub>j</sub>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="msb188250-sup-0006">Dataset EV6</xref>) were median‐shifted to zero and proportionally scaled to range from −1 to 1 for the lowest and the highest affinity drugs, respectively. Third, a table of drug–kinase relationships was populated using GDSC (Iorio <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0024">2016</xref>), CCLE (Karaman <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0026">2008</xref>; Davis <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0012">2011</xref>), and Proteomics DB (Klaeger <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0027">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="msb188250-sup-0006">Dataset EV6</xref>). Next, for each kinase in the top‐N activity rank the normalized kinase activity score is multiplied by e<sub>j</sub> of the drugs that are associated with the kinase as specified in the binary interaction table g<sub>ij</sub>. The summation over kinases in the top‐N activity rank list yields the combined kinase impact score for a cell line. In Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msb188250-fig-0006">6</xref>A, the algorithm for calculation of the kinase impact score is shown. In Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msb188250-fig-0006">6</xref>B and D, the kinase impact score for pTyr‐based and TiO<sub>2</sub>‐based phosphoproteomics data is shown as a function of the top‐N kinase activity list for all cell lines analyzed. The <italic>P</italic>‐value reported is the median of <italic>P</italic>‐values comparing kinase impact scores in cell lines for INKA and KARP (Mann–Whitney test). In Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msb188250-fig-0006">6</xref>C and E, the kinase impact score for the top 10 kinases is shown for INKA, KARP, and INKA components. The kinase impact score is globally higher for INKA than for KARP or for the four INKA components, indicating that INKA is superior in ranking kinase activities in the context of drug efficacy. This is a first step in the application of kinase activity ranking to drug selection.</p>

This score quantitatively integrates the ranking of kinases in a kinase activity score list, with measured efficacy of kinase inhibitors in cell lines. To this end, we compiled suitable and publicly available cell line phosphoproteomics data. First, a pTyr IP cell line dataset derived from PDAC cell lines (Humphrey <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0023">2016</xref>), available from proteomeXchange (PXD003198), was composed and supplemented with pTyr data from HCC827, SK‐Mel28, K‐562, and H2228 cell lines used in this manuscript, with additional pTyr data of a U87 cell line obtained from proteomeXchange (PXD001565; van der Mijn <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0053">2015</xref>).

Furthermore, we implemented the KARP algorithm from the Cutillas group (Wilkes <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="msb188250-bib-0060">2017</xref>) in R, to calculate KARP scores for all cell lines, while the remaining score lists were generated using our INKA software.</p>
30979792	            <p>We adapted INKA to phosphoproteomics data with 11‐plex TMT‐based isobaric labeling, by adding an R script to extract corrected reporter ion intensities from the pertinent MaxQuant <italic>modificationSpecificPeptides.txt</italic> file.

22778956	        <p>GIST is the most common mesenchymal malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It emerges from the interstitial cells of Cajal and is characterized by the presence of gain-of-function mutations in c-kit or platelet-derived growth factor receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These mutations result in constitutive activation of signaling pathways downstream of receptor type kinases. Recently, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (ST12571, Novartis), was reported to be highly effective in treatment of GIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although the effects of imatinib mesylate are obvious, only a limited number of patients may benefit from treatment because the proportion of highly malignant or high-risk GIST is only 20%–35%, while 60%–80% of GIST patients can be cured by surgical resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, biomarkers to assess the malignant potential of GIST and predict postsurgery metastasis are required to optimize therapeutic strategies.</p>

The normalized reads of all shRNAs present in resistant tumors or starting materials were quantified using HiSeq 2500 sequencing of shRNA guide strands PCR amplified from the isolated genomic DNA, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zuber et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>). Sequence processing was performed using a customized Galaxy platform as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>). For each shRNA and condition, the number of matching reads was normalized to the total number of library-specific reads per lane (10 million total reads per pool) and used for further analysis. We only obtained 21 pools of reads in pregrafts therefore reads in plasmids were used as starting material instead. All the HiSeq sequencing results (FASTQ) and normalized reads files were deposited to GEO: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0170" ns0:href="ncbi-geo:GSE127957">GSE127957</ext-link>. To adapt a probabilistic ranking algorithm RIGER-E (RNAi Gene Enrichment Ranking) to analyze the HiSeq results, we recorded the hairpin reads in the tumors which did not score by week 16 as “0” because they failed to enrich quicker than stochastically enriched hairpins, in order to have a working matrix for a probabilistic statistic model. RIGER analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golden et al., 2017</xref>) and the data matrix was deposited to GEO: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0175" ns0:href="ncbi-geo:GSE127957">GSE127957</ext-link>. We then applied two additional cut-offs to further filter out the false positive candidate genes. We chose “enriched in more than 8% of total tumor xenografted” as a first cut-off based on the stochastic enrichment ratio of negative control gene <italic>TBC1D4</italic>. We chose “4 out of 6 hairpins enriched” as the second cut-off based on a triangle thresholding method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zack et al., 1977</xref>) and the results of our pilot experiments. The enrichment of each shRNAs was determined by comparing the normalized reads in the resistant tumors with the normalized reads in plasmids.</p>

32728212	        <p id="P33">For quality control of RNA extraction yield and library synthesis products, the RNA ScreenTape kit (Agilent Technologies), D1000 Screen-Tape kit (Agilent Technologies), Qubit RNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen) and Qubit DNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen) were used for each specific purpose. For mRNA library preparation, the KAPA Stranded mRNA-seq kit with mRNA capture beads (Kapa Biosystems) was used. In brief, 1 μg was used for the library construction, and the library was eluted in 20 μl of elution buffer. Libraries were adjusted to 10 mM, then 10 μl from each sample was collected and pooled in one tube. A pool of multiplex samples (1.5 pM including PhiX 1.5%) was loaded into the NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 kit (75 cycles) cartridge (Illumina) and loaded on a NextSeq 500 System (Illumina), with 75 cycles and single-read-sequencing conditions. Obtained sequencing data were aligned to the Ensembl <italic>Mus musculus</italic> reference genome, revision 92 (mm10), and read counts per gene were normalized to sequencing depth and gene length as fragments per kilobase per million reads mapped (FPKM). Differential expression was assessed using DESeq2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Genes were considered differentially expressed if they had an FPKM &gt; 1 in at least one sample and showed an absolute log-transformed fold change ≥ 1 together with a false discovery rate (FDR) &gt; 0.05 (Benjamini– Hochberg-corrected <italic>P</italic> value). Gene sets for the over-representation analysis were obtained from the Ingenuity database and the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB; version 5.0, collections H, C2, C5, C6 and C7). The significance of over-representation was assessed using a hypergeometric test and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction.

26910887	        <p>We previously reported that synthetic analogues of strigolactones (SLs) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) reduce the viability of a variety of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. To assess whether SLs induce cell cycle arrest or cell death in the U2OS osteosarcoma cell line, we stained the cells with propidium iodide (PI) and examined cell cycle progression by FACS. A significant increase in the percentage of U2OS cells in G2/M and sub-G1 phases was detected at 24 and 48 hr after treatment with the strigolactone analogs MEB55 or ST362 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To further assess the impact of SLs on cell death, dual staining with Annexin V and PI was employed. Annexin V is a marker of early apoptosis, while PI stains cells in late apoptosis with a compromised plasma membrane. A significant increase in early and late apoptosis was detected in U2OS cells after 24 hr treatment with either MEB55 or ST362 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). An increase in caspase 3/7 activity was detected as early as 8 hours after treatment with MEB55 and further corroborated the induction of MEB55-mediated apoptotic cell death (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p>

26910887	        <p>Next, we examined the possibility that cellular responses to SLs are associated with DNA damage and loss of genomic stability. Metaphase spreads of U2OS cells were prepared and stained with DAPI after treatment with 5 or 10 ppm of MEB55 or ST362 for 24 hr. U2OS osteosarcoma cells contain chromosome counts in the hypertriploid range; the average chromosome count in untreated cells displaying long intact chromosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) is 113±7.3 chromosomes per metaphase spread. Treatments with MEB55 or ST362 led to a significant increase in chromosome count (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) with an average of 140±3.4 and 141±3.8 chromosomes per metaphase spread, respectively (***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p>
26910887	            <p><bold>A.</bold> U2OS cells were treated with 5 or 10 ppm of MEB55 or ST362 for 5 hr and subjected to metaphase spread assays to examine chromosome integrity.

Values represent mean +/− SD. (** <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001)­­­­.</p>
26910887	        <p>To determine whether SLs induce chromosome breakage <italic>via</italic> DNA crosslinking, we analyzed the chromosomes of lymphoblast cells derived from a Fanconi Anemia complementation group C (FANCC) patient. Metaphase analysis demonstrates that the FANCC cells are highly sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC), a DNA crosslinking agent, that induces both chromosome crosslinking and DNA breaks. SLs caused a higher rate of chromosome breaks relative to control (1.4 breaks per cell in ST362-treated cells <italic>vs</italic>. 0.8 breaks /cell in control cells) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E and 2F</xref>). However, no chromosomal crosslinking was observed in SL-treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).</p>
26910887	        <p>To determine whether SLs treatment elicits activation of the DNA damage response (DDR), we analyzed the phosphorylation of the DNA DSBs marker, histone H2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], in U2OS cells treated with 10 ppm of MEB55 or ST362 for 4 hr. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> shows that expression of γH2AX is induced in SLs-treated cells similar to cells exposed to 8 Gy of ionizing radiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We further analyzed the phosphorylation/activation of the DNA damage sensors ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs and their downstream checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Chk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. U2OS cells were treated with either MEB55 or ST362 at 10 ppm for 4 hours or with 8 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR) as a positive control. Immunoblot analysis revealed that ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs phosphorylation is induced in response to SLs, in addition to the phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, we show that the well-established DSB marker, 53BP1, is recruited to DSB sites and co-localizes with γH2AX foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] upon treatment with 10 ppm of ST362 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure S3</xref>) or 10 ppm of MEB55 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p>
26910887	            <p><bold>A.</bold> U2OS cells were treated with vehicle or 10 ppm of SLs (MEB55 or ST362) for 4 hr. Following histone extraction, expression levels of histone H2A and γH2AX were analyzed by immunoblot. <bold>B.</bold> Following treatment with 10 ppm of MEB55 or ST362, U2OS cells were lysed and expression levels of ATM, phosphorylated ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs as well as phosphorylated Chk1 and Chk2 were analyzed by immunoblot. β-Actin was employed as a loading control. <bold>C.</bold> U2OS cells were treated with 10 ppm of ST362 or MEB55 for 3 hr or with 8 Gy ionizing radiation (IR) as a positive control. Immunofluorescent analysis indicates that 53BP1 co-localizes with γH2AX foci. <bold>D.</bold> Co-localization of 53BP1 and γH2AX in nuclear foci in DU145 prostate cancer cell line, patient-derived conditionally-reprogrammed prostate cancer cells (PP8T), or patient-derived prostate cancer organoid conditionally-reprogrammed PCA3 cells treated with 10 ppm of MEB55 or IR as positive control. <bold>E.</bold> γH2AX foci in U2OS and BJ fibroblasts in response to 8 Gy IR or 20 ppm ST362.</p>
26910887	        <p>We next analyzed whether the homologous repair protein, RAD51, co-localizes to the DSBs sites formed in response to SLs treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. RAD51 recruitment to γH2AX sites indicates that cells have initiated DNA repair by HDR at the damaged sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Because SLs cause cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], we hypothesized that HDR would be the main mechanism of DSBs repair. However, unlike 53BP1, RAD51 did not form distinct foci that co-localize with γH2AX foci in U2OS cells or in DU145 cells treated with 10 ppm MEB55 or ST362 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Moreover, immunoblot analysis revealed that RAD51 expression is down-regulated beginning 1 hr after treatment with 10 ppm of MEB55 and continues to decline by 5 hr. Pre-treatment of cells with 10 μM of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, alleviated RAD51 down-regulation by SLs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B and 4C</xref>) and demonstrated that RAD51 becomes poly-ubiquitinated following SLs treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Together, our data indicate that SLs target RAD51 for proteasomal degradation, thereby disrupting its redistribution onto sites of DSBs.</p>
26910887	            <p><bold>A.</bold> RAD51 fails to co-localize with γH2AX foci. U2OS and DU145 cells were treated with ST362 or MEB55 at 10 ppm for 4 hr or with 8 Gy IR as a positive control and then stained for immunofluorescent analysis of RAD51 and γH2AX. <bold>B.</bold> SLs down regulate RAD51. U2OS cells were treated with 10 ppm of MEB55 for the indicated times or pre-treated with MG132 at 10 μM 1 hr prior to MEB55 treatment. RAD51 expression was analyzed by immunoblot. β-Actin was employed as a loading control. The experiment was repeated at least three times. <bold>C.</bold> Quantification of normalized RAD51 relative to vehicle-treated cells. <bold>D.</bold> RAD51 is poly-ubiquitinated upon SLs-treatment. U2OS cells were pre-treated with 10 μM MG132 1 hr prior to treatment with 10 ppm of MEB55 or vehicle. Three mg of whole cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4°C with a polyclonal antibody against RAD51 and protein A/G. Ubiquitination was resolved by immunoblot with an antibody against poly-ubiquitined proteins (left panel) or RAD51 (right panel).</p>
26910887	        <p>To further elucidate the mechanisms by which SLs cause DSBs and interfere with their repair, we tested whether SLs intercalate into the DNA by an ethidium bromide (EtBr) displacement assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. The fluorescence of EtBr is weak in aqueous solution, but its strong intercalation into the DNA greatly enhances its fluorescence intensity. Using cell-free circulating DNA (CT-DNA), we tested whether SLs can displace pre-bound EtBr. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> shows that despite increasing concentrations (1.25 ppm-20 ppm) of MEB55 or ST362, there was no decrease in the emission intensity of EtBr, indicating that SLs do not displace or compete with EtBr (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p>
26910887	            <p><bold>A.</bold> SLs do not intercalate into DNA and do not displace EtBr. Circular DNA was incubated with EtBr at 0.8 ug/mL for 1 hr before the indicated concentrations of MEB55 were added. The fluorescence intensity (I/I0) of samples was excited at 525 nm, and measured at 590 nm. <bold>B.</bold> Similar to (A) except DNA was resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel. <bold>C.</bold> Topoisomerase-I inhibition assays. The purified, end-labeled 117 bp nucleotide encompassing Top1 cleavage sites was incubated with recombinant Top1 enzyme in the presence of various concentrations of MEB55 (left) or ST362 (right). <bold>D.</bold> U2OS cells were seeded in 6 replicates into 96-well plates (2500/well) and their growth in response to 96 hr treatments with different concentrations of MEB55 and doxorubicin relative to vehicle-treated (DMSO) cells was analyzed by XTT assay. C-Index curve analysis (Chou and Talalay plot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]) for DOX/SLs in U2OS indicates synergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] when C-Index values are less than 1 (the horizontal line that indicates the additive effect). Values greater than 1 indicate antagonism. To calculate the FA point DOX/SLs were mixed using constant ratios corresponding to 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 times the IC<sub>50</sub> for each drug. Graph is representative of at least three independent experiments. <bold>E.</bold> U2OS cells were seeded into 96-well plates (2500/well) in 6 replicates and their growth in response to 96 hr treatments with different concentrations of MEB55 and olaparib relative to vehicle-treated (DMSO) cells was analyzed by crystal violet assay. Graph is representative of mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments. Data points are connected by non-linear regression of the sigmoidal dose-response. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of olaparib in the presence of MEB55 is 0.329 μM with 95% CI (1.121-5.356). <bold>F.</bold> BRCA1-silenced U2OS, U34, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] growth in response to MEB55 and olaparib was analyzed as in (E). An immunoblot is presented to confirm the loss of BRCA1 expression in U34, relative to parental U2OS and U2OS cells overexpressing BRCA1 as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>].</p>
26910887	      <p>The results of this study show that the synthetic strigolactone analogs, MEB55 and ST362, induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], which is accompanied by induction of DNA damage in the form of DSBs and inhibition of DSB repair. The increase in chromosome count following SLs treatment was visualized by metaphase spreads. The presence of DNA DSBs was visualized by the non-denaturing Comet assay and was further supported by the formation of nuclear γH2AX foci that mark DSBs. The phosphorylation of ATM and ATR kinases and their downstream effectors Chk1 and Chk2, as well as co-localization of 53BP1 with γH2AX foci indicate that cells sense SLs-mediated DNA damage and activate the DNA damage response signaling. The failure of the homologous recombination repair protein, RAD51, to localize to γH2AX-marked damage sites and activate HDR indicates that SLs induce uncoupling between DNA damage signaling and DNA repair that could trigger cell death. The selectivity of SLs toward cancer cells was demonstrated by the very few nuclear γH2AX foci indicative of DSBs that were detected in normal BJ fibroblasts with no significant differences between SLs-treated and non-treated cells.</p>
26910887	        <p>U2OS cells were treated with vehicle or 10 ppm of MEB55 or ST362 for 5 hr. Colcemid (0.1 μg/ml) was added to the medium 1 hr before harvesting. Cells were trypsinized and cell pellets were washed with 1x PBS prior to the addition of hypotonic solution (0.8% sodium citrate). Cells were fixed in Carnoy's fixative (3:1 absolute Methanol: glacial acetic acid) and then dropped onto glass slides, air-dried and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Slides were imaged on the Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. Averages of chromosome counts of 20 cells per treatment were counted and statistically analyzed by an unpaired t­-test compared to the untreated samples. FANCC cells were treated with 300 nM Mitomycin C or 10 ppm ST362 and MEB55 for three days and metaphase spreads were prepared according to the protocol previously described by Oostra AB, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>].</p>
26910887	        <p>The effect of SLs on NHEJ was analyzed <italic>via</italic> a U2OS EJ5-GFP reporter system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Cells were transfected with pCBA<italic>Sce</italic>, an empty vector, pCAGGS, as a negative control or full-length GFP expression construct (NZF-GFP) as a positive control for GFP+ cells. On the next day, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of ST362 and MEB55 and after an additional 24 hr, cells were processed for flow cytometric analysis. For each analysis, 1×10<sup>4</sup> cells were collected. Each data point represents the mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments.</p>
26910887	        <p>U2OS cells were seeded at 2,500 cells per well in 6 replicates in 96-well plates. After 24 hr, cells were treated with MEB55, ST362 or vehicle (DMSO) at the indicated doses (1.25 to 10 μM) and in combination with Doxorubicin (Sigma). After 72 hr, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet solution (0.5% crystal violet and 25% methanol in dH<sub>2</sub>O). Following extensive washing with distilled water, plates were air dried overnight. Sodium citrate solution (0.1 M) was used to solubilize bound crystal violet and optimal densities were measured at 560 nm (Glomax-Multi Detection plate reader, Promega). All survival fractions are relative to vehicle-treated control cells. Graph is representative of the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments.</p>
30240102	<bold>Results</bold>: The expression of transcription factor Gli1 was significantly higher in the bone marrow of newly diagnosed T‐ALLthan that in the control group. The expression of transcription factor Gli1 was detected in human T‐ALL cell line Jurkat cells. The transcription factor GLI1 was knock out after lentivirus have been transferred to Jurkat cells. In total 2524 genes with significant difference were obtained by the analysis of the whole gene expression profiles. The intersection analysis was carried out between the 2524 differential gene and the T‐ALL differential gene expression data set (GSE66638) in the GEO database, while the data set included 8 samples of bone marrow cells in children diagnosed with T‐ALL and 2 samples of surgical excised thymocyte cells. The results showed that the common differentially expressed genes included 11 up‐regulated genes and 4 down‐regulated genes. We have analyzed the common differentially expressed genes with reported from the literature. The results showed that the intersections genes included 3 up‐regulated genes and 2 down regulated genes. We detected the 5 intersecting genes in bone marrow samples of 5 children diagnosed with T‐ALL. The expression levels of IL1B and LTBP1mRNA were significantly decreased.</p>
30240102	<bold>Design/Methods</bold>: <italic>ASNS</italic> gene methylation in 83 cell lines and 41 primary samples of BCP‐ALL as well as normal hematopoietic cells and <italic>Asns</italic> gene methylation in mice leukemia samples were quantified by NGS analysis of bisulfite PCR. IC50 of l‐asparaginase (l‐asp) and level of <italic>ASNS</italic> gene expression were determined using alamar blue assay and real time RT‐PCR, respectively. Association between karyotype and <italic>ASNS</italic> gene methylation was analyzed in 663 NOPHO (GSE49031), 206 CCCS (GSE56599), and 93 TCCSG samples.</p>
30240102	<bold>Results</bold>: During routine aCGH diagnostic work‐up of a neuroblastoma patient, we observed a focal amplification encompassing the <italic>MTHFD1L</italic> gene, involved in folate‐mediated one‐carbon metabolism. Expression of <italic>MTHFD1L</italic> and nine other folate‐dependent one‐carbon metabolism genes (out of 19 known in the process) was found significantly higher in stage 4 disease and significantly correlated with the presence of <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification and older age (dataset GSE16476 and GSE16237). In addition, high expression of <italic>MTHFD1L</italic>, <italic>ATIC</italic>, <italic>TYMS</italic>, <italic>MTHFD2</italic> and <italic>DHFR</italic> was found to be associated with overall survival and event‐free survival. Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with methotrexate, a widely used folate antagonist blocking one‐carbon metabolism, revealed that methotrexate provoked significant cell death by apoptosis in those cell lines characterized by <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification.</p>
30240102	<bold>Results</bold>: One hundred‐thirty‐four were identified. Forty‐six (47%) left before treatment. Ninety‐seven (72%) with median age of 14 were included. Fifty‐two (64%) were female. Extremity (n=87, 92%) was the commonest site. Thirty‐six (37%) had metastatic disease. Lung (n=24, 66%) was the most frequent site of metastasis. AOST0331 protocol was given in 47(48%), 29 (30%) received Cisplatin/Adriamycin, 3 (3%) were treated on different regimens, 18 (18%) did not receive any chemotherapy. Improved 3‐years overall survival (OS) in localised disease was associated with limb salvage (n=34, 56%, P=0.091), clear surgical margins (n=25, 88%, P=0.006), and post‐operative tissue necrosis (n=22, 88%, P=0.011). Age 6‐10 years (n=21, 75%, P=0.12) and limb amputation (n=29, 64%, P=0.99) showed relatively inferior event free survival (EFS). The median follow up was 8 months (IQR 3–20 months). Seventy‐three events occurred; 14 experienced relapse (14%), 28 (29%) were treatment abandonments and mortality in 31 (40%). The 5‐year OS for both localised and metastatic osteosarcoma was 30.8 %(95% CI: 19%‐44%). The 5‐year OS for localised osteosarcoma was 44% (95% CI: 26%‐61%). The 5‐year EFS for localised osteosarcoma with relapse as an event was 69 %(95% CI: 47 %‐83%) and the 5‐years EFS for localised and both localised and metastatic disease with relapse, death and treatment abandonment as an event was 42 %(95% CI: 24%‐59%) and 29% (95% CI: 17%‐43%).</p>
30240102	<bold>Results</bold>: One hundred fifty‐three patients were identified. Forty‐one (27%) left before treatment. Data was analysed from 112, median age five years. Sixty‐five (58%) were male. Parameningeal (n=33, 29%) was the commonest site. Ninety‐one were group III (81%), 41 were stage 3 (36%), 20 were stage 2 (18%) and 21(19%) stage 1 and 4 each. Ninety‐four (84%) were embryonal. Tumour size was &gt; 5cm in 58 (52%). Eighty‐two (73%) had localised disease, 21 (19%) metastatic with lung (n=8, 38%) the commonest site. 96 (86%) were treated. Majority (n=84, 75%) received ARST0531, 3 (3%) received high‐risk protocol. 36 (32%) received radiation, 15 (13%) surgery whereas 23 (21%) surgery + radiation. Median follow‐up period was 11 months. Improved 5‐year overall survival (OS) was associated with age 1‐9 years (60%, P=0.029), dose of radiation 50Gy (85%, P=0.004), and local control with surgery + radiation (90%, P=0.001). 70 events occurred; 12 relapsed (11%) and 27 (24%) died; 1 (4%) had progressive disease and 10 (37%) died during treatment, cause remained unknown in 16 (59%) and 31 (28 %) abandoned treatment. Five‐year (OS) in both localised and metastatic disease was 58% (95% CI:51.6‐70.83) and event free survival (EFS) with relapse was 70% (95% CI:62.93‐83.06). Five‐year (OS) in patients treated with curative intent was 60% (95% CI:54.71‐74.72) and EFS with relapse was 73%(95% CI:63.10‐83.66). EFS with relapse + death and treatment abandonment was 35% (95% CI:27.38‐44.32).</p>
30240102	<bold>Results</bold>: Exome sequencing of the younger sibling detected a homozygous 5’ splice site variation in intron 12 of the PMS2 gene (chr7:6022454C&gt;A; Depth: 24x) that affects the invariant GT donor splice site (c.2174+1G&gt;T; ENST00000265849). The <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of the variant was found to be damaging by MutationTaster2, and the variant was predicted to alter the donor site splicing by the <italic>in silico</italic> prediction tool human gene splice finder. The observed variant has previously been reported in one case, in a study with clinical phenotype of Lynch syndrome. The <italic>PMS2</italic> gene is a member of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, and mutations in this gene have been associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). On segregation analysis, the observed variant c.2174+1G&gt;T in <italic>PMS2</italic> gene was detected in homozygous state in the elder sibling, heterozygous state in the unaffected parents. Thus, the homozygous variant segregated with the affected individuals in this family.</p>

Organoid or cell line total RNA was labelled with Cye3-CTP and a mouse or human reference standard RNA (Stratagene) was labelled with Cye5-CTP by direct incorporation using a Quick-Amp labeling kit (Agilent). Purified, labelled cDNA products were hybridised to 8 × 60K mouse or human microarray following the manufacturers’ instructions (Agilent). Microrarray slides were washed, scanned and analysed. Mouse organoid data were analysed using Arraytools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html">http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html</ext-link>) and the colon cancer cell line data using Genespring (Agilent). A similar analysis was performed on both datasets. Lowess intensity dependent normalization was used to adjust for differences in labelling intensities of the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. We identified genes that were differentially expressed using a multivariate permutation test to provide confidence that the false discovery rate was less than 5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. The test statistics used were random variance t-statistics for each gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Although t-statistics were used, the multivariate permutation test was non-parametric and does not require the assumption of Gaussian distributions. The significantly differentially expressed genes were investigated for enrichment in terms of particular pathways or potential transcription factor regulation using the Metacore software (Thomson Reuters).

29706648	        <p id="Par5">To identify the unique regulatory mechanisms underlying stem cell radiation response, gene expression profiles of isogenic ES and ED cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> were compared before and after radiation treatment using genechip microarray analysis. With the aim of finding contrasting gene expression patterns, differential alterations in expression profiles were investigated at an early time point of 15 min (radiation early, RE) and at a late time point of 4 h (radiation late, RL) after irradiation on ES and ED cells. Differentiation of stem cells led to transcriptional induction of 3622 genes, whereas 4960 genes were suppressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Of these 8582 genes, expression of 139 genes was commonly altered when stem cells underwent differentiation, as well as after irradiation of differentiated cells. In contrast, expression of 144 genes was commonly altered following both differentiation and irradiation in stem cells (Supplemental Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1A</xref>). We reason that these unique subsets of genes in the intersection lists (Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, the raw data of gene-expression profiling at NIH’s Gene Expression Omnibus can be found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=hpexbaiyaoawyre&amp;acc=GSE44780) contain potential molecular regulators of the radiosensitive and radioresistant phenotypes of stem and non-stem cells, respectively. Pathway analysis, enrichment scores, and functional interaction determinations using GeneGo analyses showed that the most pronounced IR-induced change in the stem cell transcriptome was associated with affecting biosynthesis such as ribosome expression. The non-stem cell transcriptome, however, promoted activation of survival signaling pathways as well as protein digestion and absorption (Supplemental Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1B</xref>). Through rigorous statistical short listing and verification analyses, we identified overexpression and substantial radiation induction of the catalytic subunit of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) selectively in stem cells, which was confirmed by RT-PCR (Supplemental Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1C</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>PP2A is constitutively overexpressed in stem cells in vivo and in culture.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The number of genes up- or downregulated more than two-fold is compared between ES and ED cells as well as among irradiated ES and ED cells collected early (15 min; RE, radiation early) or late (4 h; RL, radiation late) after 10 Gy IR using microarray analysis. <bold>b</bold> PP2A and GAPDH were detected in lysates of ES and ED cells using immunoblot. <bold>c</bold> Tissue sections obtained from testis of WT C57BL/6 mice were stained with Oct4, PP2A, and DNA labeled with DAPI. <bold>d</bold> Tissue sections of the dentate gyrus of hippocampus obtained from brains of WT C57BL/6 mice were stained with SOX2, PP2A, and DNA labeled with DAPI. <bold>e</bold> ES and ED were co-plated and stained with SOX2, PP2A, and DNA labeled with DAPI.

29334357	        <p>RNA-seq data raw counts were normalized and the variance was stabilized using DESeq2 package (Bioconductor) in R-studio 0.99.902, R v3.3.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, ISBN 3-900051-07-0). Differential gene expression signatures were defined as a list of genes ranked by their differential expression between any two phenotypes of interest (e.g. APCA versus ADCA lines; CRPC-NE versus CRPC, etc.), estimated using a two-sample two-tailed Welch t-test (for n ≥ 3) or fold-change (for n &lt; 3). For comparison of a mouse gene signature with a human gene signature, mouse genes were mapped to their corresponding human orthologs based on the homoloGene database (NCBI). Signatures were compared using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>), with the significance of enrichment estimated using 1000 gene permutations. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the C2 database, which includes pathways from REACTOME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabregat et al., 2016</xref>), KEGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ogata et al., 1999</xref>), and BioCarta (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns1:href="http://www.biocarta.com/genes/allpathways.asp">http://www.biocarta.com/genes/allpathways.asp</ext-link>).

29560860	        <p>Using published patient sample analyses, we selected three miRNAs: miR-34c-5p, −30e and −144, that were found to be downmodulated significantly in breast tumors and tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>)(GSE25464) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2005</xref>). By <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of tissue arrays containing 40 breast tumors vs. normal tissues, we confirmed a significant reduction of the three miRNAs in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, c</xref>). Re-expression of each of the three miRNAs in T4-2 cells led to dramatic growth inhibition in soft agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and caused phenotypic reversion in lrECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Introduction of each of the three miRNAs into metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells also led to severe growth impairment in lrECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). These results suggest that the three miRNAs are involved in inhibiting tumor cell growth and, by implication, in the maintenance of non-malignant cell behavior.</p>

Conversely, from the Snail-high pBl.3G cells, chromatin fragments were only recoverable from Snail ChIP but not Slug ChIP, demonstrating the specificities of these antibodies. Slug- or Snail-bound DNA sites were determined with Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) algorithm, and bound target genes were defined as containing Slug or Snail occupancy within 5 kb upstream and downstream relative to the transcription start site for each RefSeq transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Fold enrichment of each MACS peak were calculated against the whole cell extract.

29170450	        <p id="Par13">As our findings indicate a role for Notch in EMT, we next sought to determine how Notch1 regulates cell fate in squamous epithelia. The <italic>8×CSL-GFP</italic> reporter activity was unaffected in CD44T and CD44H cells upon calcium-mediated squamous-cell differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In CD44L cells, which displayed differentiation in organotypic 3D culture (OTC) when compared to invasive CD44H cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>), calcium treatment enhanced Notch activity in a subset of cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Thus, local environmental cues may impact Notch signaling to direct cell fate determination. In agreement with this notion, pharmacological inhibition of TGFβ signaling in purified CD44H cells induced CD44L cells with concurrent downregulation of EMT markers and <italic>NOTCH3</italic> upregulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e, f</xref>). A trend toward increased <italic>Notch3</italic> expression was also detected in peeled murine esophageal epithelia with 4NQO-induced neoplastic lesions following treatment with anti-TGFβ-blocking antibody 1D11 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3e</xref>). Gene array analysis in EPC2T cells revealed further that ectopic ICN1 expression induced a gene expression pattern compatible with squamous-cell differentiation. However, TGFβ treatment in the context of ICN1-overexpression triggered a robust shift toward an EMT-associated gene expression signature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3f</xref>) (GSE37994, GSE37993). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that ICN1 and TGFβ cooperate to induce expression of EMT regulators, including <italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>SNAI1</italic>, while TGFβ limited ICN1-mediated expression of <italic>NOTCH3</italic> as well as <italic>IVL</italic>, the latter a marker of terminal differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>). Although the lack of discontinuous CD44L and CD44H cell populations in EN60 and TE11 prevented their isolation for long-term cell culture analyses, the role of Notch and TGFβ signaling in induction of CD44H cells and regulation of squamous-cell differentiation was recapitulated in TE11 cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3g–i</xref>).</p>

30014851	        <p>Total RNA was isolated from cells sorted into TRIzolLS and assessed using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent). Sequencing and library preparation was performed at the Integrated Genomics Operation (IGO) at MSKCC. Ribosomal RNA was depleted using RiboZero (Illumina) and stranded KAPA RNA libraries were prepared from 1 ug RNA. Approximately 40 million paired-end 50 bp reads were sequenced per replicate on a HiSeq 2000. Resulting RNA-Seq data was analyzed by removing adaptor sequences using Trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). Reads were then aligned to the mouse genome (NCBI37/mm9) using STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) and transcript counting was performed by HTseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>).

Pathway analysis was performed using the GSEA pre-ranked mode against signatures in the MSigDB database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns1:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb">http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb</ext-link>) and published expression signatures in organoid and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holmstrom et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
30014851	        <p>50,000 mKate2<sup>+</sup> cells isolated by FACS were lysed in 50 ul lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>) and subjected to transposition with Nextera Tn5 transposase according to manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina FC-121–1030). DNA was eluted from a MinElute column in 11.5 ul elution buffer (Qiagen). ATAC libraries were constructed using the NEBNext High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (NEB M0541) as in Buenrostro et al with the following modifications: DNA was PCR-amplified for 1 cycle of 5’ at 72°C and 30’ at 98°C followed by 12 cycles of 10’ at 98°C, 30’ at 63°C and 1’ at 72°C. Amplified DNA was purified on a Qiagen MinElute column and eluted in 22 ul of Qiagen elution buffer. Purified libraries were assessed using a Bioanalyzer High-Sensitivity DNA Analysis kit (Agilent). Paired-end 50 bp reads were sequenced with the Center for Epigenetics Research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Reads were trimmed for quality and Illumina adapter sequences using ‘trim_galore’ then aligned to mouse genome assembly mm9 with bowtie2 using the default parameters. Aligned reads with the same start site and orientation were removed using the Picard tool MarkDuplicates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns1:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). Density profiles for genome browser tracks were created using the BEDTools suite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns1:href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io">http://bedtools.readthedocs.io</ext-link>). Enriched regions were discovered using MACS2 and scored against input sequence (fold change &gt;2 and p-value&lt;0.001). Dynamic regions between two conditions were discovered using a similar method, with the second ATAC library replacing input. Peaks were then filtered against genomic ‘blacklisted’ regions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns1:href="http://mitra.stanford.edu/kundaje/akundaje/release/blacklists/mm9-mouse/mm9-blacklist.bed.gz">http://mitra.stanford.edu/kundaje/akundaje/release/blacklists/mm9-mouse/mm9-blacklist.bed.gz</ext-link>) and those within 500 bp were merged. All genome browser tracks and read density tables were normalized to a sequencing depth of ten million mapped reads. K-means clustering was performed on all dynamic peaks, with the optimal k determined by silhouette analysis. Dynamic peaks were annotated using linear genomic distance and motif signatures were obtained using the ‘de novo’ approach with Homer v4.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns1:href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/">http://homer.ucsd.edu/</ext-link>). For analyses of TF density, transcription factor ChIP-seq enriched regions were discovered by comparison with matched input using MACS2, as with the ATAC-seq data. TF peaks overlapping sites decreasing in accessibility were classified using 'bedtools intersect' with an overlap of 1 bp. Gene density of these peaks was calculated using RefSeq annotated gene boundaries ± 30 kb of gene start or end, and these gene names were then matched with either differentially expressed genes, or genes with expression not changing by more than 10%.

33304752	        <p>To detect whether reduction of mitochondrial respiratory activity could also be detected in clinical breast cancer patients. We further investigated mitochondrial respiratory activity in three breast cancer patient‐derived organoids, and their response to cisplatin treatment. The results indicated that the organoid derived from BRC20170303 patient had the highest mitochondrial respiratory activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="advs2054-fig-0006">6G</xref>), which was also the most sensitive one in response to cisplatin treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="advs2054-fig-0006">6H</xref>). The other two PDOs had lower mitochondrial respiratory activity, which are more resistance to cisplatin compared with BRC20170303 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="advs2054-fig-0006">6G</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="advs2054-fig-0006">H</xref>). We also checked the expression of mitochondrial respiration complex genes (<italic>n</italic> = 54) in a cohort of breast cancer patients (GEO dataset, GSE6434, <italic>n</italic> = 24), which have sensitive and resistant groups. The distribution of gene expression related to mitochondrial respiration complex in the resistant group is lower than the sensitive group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="advs2054-fig-0006">6I</xref>). Of note, we found a significant decreased expression of mitochondrial complex I genes (NDUFA6, NDUFA7, NDUFS6, NDUFS7, and NDUFV1) in the resistant group (Figure S7D, Supporting Information), which is consistent with the RNAi screening results. The expression of these genes was moderately correlated in both the sensitive and resistant group (Figure S7E, Supporting Information). All these results indicate that reduction of mitochondrial respiratory activity could also be detected in clinical breast cancer patients.</p>
33304752	<italic>GEO Dataset</italic>: To estimate the graded reduction of mitochondrial respiratory activity among breast cancer patients, the expression data in breast cancer were downloaded from a cohort (GSE6434) including 24 breast cancer patients for further analysis.

And the correlation of mitochondrial respiratory genes expression between samples was calculated using Pearson method.</p>

The BCM Genomic and RNA Profiling Core performed sample quality checks using the Nanodrop ND-1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and a Bioanalyzer Nano chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

24618085	        <p>NME cells were cultured in the presence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 4 weeks, at the end of which TGF-β1 supplementation was discontinued and the cells were allowed to recover for an additional 4 weeks. Total RNA was prepared from unstimulated cells of similar passage (pre-TGF) and the post-TGF NME cells. Microarray analyses were performed in triplicate using the GeneChip Mouse Gene ST 1.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Genes regulated more than twofold are given in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2. The complete data set has been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [GEO:GSE54491] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p>
24618085	        <p>Given that TGF-β treatment and metastasis are capable of selecting for a spontaneously metastatic cell model that has renewed E-cad expression, we next sought to identify stable changes in gene expression that could characterize cells that reside in either a pre- or post-TGF-β exposure state. To do so, we conducted microarray analyses of NME cells that had undergone 4 weeks of exogenous TGF-β1 treatment, which was followed by an additional 4-week withdrawal of exogenous TGF-β1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2). Indeed, following this experimental protocol, the expression patterns of traditional EMT markers, such as E-cad, N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin, Twist and Snail all returned to baseline levels (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2). Surprisingly, 98 genes were stably modulated more than threefold following this TGF-β treatment and withdrawal protocol. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the highest degree of overlap between genes upregulated in our gene list was that of genes downregulated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts after 10 hours of TGF-β treatment [GEO:GSE15871] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, 15 upregulated and 28 downregulated genes in our data set were shared with a data set generated upon knockout of the TGF-β family member bone morphogenic protein 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The transcription factor Snai2, which functions to inhibit the expression of E-cad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], was downregulated tenfold in cells that had undergone this cycle of TGF-β treatment and withdrawal. Taken together, these findings suggest that certain aspects of TGF-β signaling can be stably altered, leading to a unique transcriptional profile in cells following prolonged ligand exposure and withdrawal.</p>
24618085	        <p>Further analysis of the microarray data established that three EGFR ligands, betacellulin, amphiregulin and epiregulin were all potently downregulated (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Figure S3). Conversely, FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 were upregulated 15.8-, 4.2- and 14.8-fold, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Given these findings and a growing interest in targeting FGFR as a treatment for BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we sought to further assess the role of FGFR in facilitating pulmonary metastatic outgrowth. In doing so, we first examined FGFR expression in our NME progression series. In this system generated <italic>in vivo</italic>, FGFR1 was the predominant family member stably upregulated in the metastatic NME-LM2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Using a condensed <italic>in vitro</italic> TGF-β treatment and withdrawal experiment, we demonstrate the stable upregulation of FGFR1 in the transformed NME cells as compared to their nontransformed NMuMG counterparts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). Similarly to the NME progression series, the human MCF10A BC progression series also displayed a robust increase in FGFR1 expression in cells with a higher metastatic potential (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). Importantly, analysis of 20 human BC samples revealed a five- to tenfold increase in the expression of FGFR1 to FGFR4 in tumor tissue as compared to matched normal tissue (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Table S4). Furthermore, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the GEO data set [GEO:GSE20437] in which we compared normal and prophylactically removed mammary tissue to ER + and ER - tumor tissues demonstrated significant increases in several FGFR family members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E). In light of other recent findings that suggest a role for FGFR1 in driving the progression of basal-type BCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], our findings clearly indicate that FGFR1 is upregulated in BCs with increasing metastatic potential. They also suggest that FGFR1 may be capable of driving the pulmonary outgrowth of metastatic BCs.</p>

31148594	<italic>Apc</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (Cont 1, 15 days post TAM injection, n=3) and wild-type colon epithelium (Cont 2, n=4) were used as controls. Micro-dissected tumor and normal tissues from mice had transcript abundances measured with Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 2.1 strips using WT-Pico kits, while organoid samples were run on ST 2.1 plates, using Affymetrix Affy Plus kits. The 41345 probe-sets on the two platforms are identical. Transcript abundances were estimated using the RMA algorithm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], separately for the two experiments. We analyzed only 24562 probe-sets that had associated Entrez gene IDs. Our raw and processed data as well as our statistical analysis are available in GEO series GSE125262. For enrichment test, we mapped mouse genes to human homologs using only 1-to-1 best homologs from NCBI Homologene build 68, giving 15850 distinct genes. We tested our up and down gene lists for enrichment in 50 Hallmark gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB v6.1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].

29472497	  <body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy in the United States, with ∼50,000 deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Siegel et al., 2016</xref>). Chronic intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Terzic et al., 2010</xref>) and elevated activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) have been associated with increased risk of CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sibilia et al., 2007</xref>). CRCs arise after the loss of tumor suppressor genes, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), from intestinal epithelial stem cells that reside at the base of the crypt. This is followed by a stepwise accumulation of mutations in oncogenes, such as the Kirsten rat sarcoma virus oncogene <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996</xref>). The standard of care for unresectable metastatic CRC includes chemotherapy combined with neutralizing antibodies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or EGF-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tobin et al., 2015</xref>). Because overexpression of EGF-R is found in the majority of CRC patients, therapeutic inhibition of this signaling cascade is a seemingly obvious treatment option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haraldsdottir and Bekaii-Saab, 2013</xref>). However, it is now clear that EGF-R–blocking antibodies, including cetuximab or pantuximab, are beneficial only in patients who do not harbor <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linardou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tobin et al., 2015</xref>). Unfortunately, even in <italic>KRAS</italic> WT patients with an initial response, resistance against EGF-R blockade almost invariably occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pietrantonio et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CRC are warranted.</p><p>The receptor tyrosine kinase EGF-R controls proliferation, differentiation, gastric barrier function, and cellular survival, highlighting a driving role in various epithelial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sibilia et al., 2007</xref>). EGF-R belongs to a family of four receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>), which are engaged by 11 different ligands, leading to activation of several signaling pathways often involved in cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>). Each of the ligands for EGF-R is synthesized as a transmembrane precursor protein, which needs to be cleaved to act systemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blobel, 2005</xref>). This cleavage is performed by members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, with most ligands cleaved by the protease ADAM17, which is a membrane-bound metalloprotease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moss et al., 1997</xref>). To date, more than 80 different substrates have been reported for ADAM17, including TNFα, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), L-selectin, and both TNFα receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scheller et al., 2011a</xref>). As such, ADAM17 regulates the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway through generation of the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan et al., 2016</xref>), which drives most of the proinflammatory activities of the cytokine IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rose-John et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Systemic ADAM17 knockout mice are not viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peschon et al., 1998</xref>).

Thus we analyzed conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) using the oPossum tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>) to identify enriched motifs using the full set of regulated transcripts. The analysis indicated an overrepresentation of genes regulated by transcription factors such as KLF4, SP1, and Zfx, which have been associated with cellular proliferation and stemness in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> tumors, which is down-regulated in the absence of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Most interestingly, in tumor tissue, TCFCP2L1, a known Wnt target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>), and STAT3 TFBSs were enriched with high statistical scores (<italic>z</italic>-score and Fisher score).

In contrast, expression of amphiregulin protein was higher in the intestine of Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice, presumably because of the absence of ADAM17 shedding activity (not depicted), as has already been demonstrated for the EGF-R ligand TGFα, which accumulated at the cell surface of intestinal epithelial cells in the absence of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>).

intestinal microbiome strongly affects barrier function and tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O’Keefe, 2016</xref>). Because ADAM17 is needed for proper intestinal barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>), we wondered whether the absence of ADAM17 would have an influence on the composition of the intestinal microbiome. We profiled the fecal microbiome from unchallenged WT and ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice by analyzing the DNA sequence encoding the 16S rRNA. Multidimensional scaling revealed distinct clustering between WT, heterozygous ADAM17<sup>wt/ex</sup>, and homozygous ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice (Fig. S5 A). Significant changes were observed by operational taxonomical unit analysis of the respective genotypes depicted by heat map (Fig. S5 B). Interestingly, several bacterial taxa were depleted in the hypomorphic ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> animals, which are involved in fermentation of dietary fiber into butyrate (<italic>Coprococcus</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>; Fig. S5 B), a metabolic process protecting from colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byndloss et al., 2017</xref>). Similar shifts in abundances have been detected in human CRC patients. Altogether, these data indicate that without any additional stimulus or pathological condition, the absence of ADAM17 has a remarkable effect on constitution of the intestinal microbiota, which might relate to the altered epithelial gene expression and contribute to tumorigenesis. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S5 C, inferred Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) categories in <sc>d</sc>-arginine, <sc>d</sc>-ornithine metabolism and inositol phosphate metabolism were significantly different between WT and ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice. These metabolites are considered to be important for the maintenance of intestinal barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glover et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s09"><title>Tumor formation in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model is dependent on IL-6 trans-signaling</title><p>EGF-R activity in myeloid cells is needed for tumorigenesis in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>) as well as in an inflammation-associated CRC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardbower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>). Because the sIL-6R is generated via limited proteolysis by the ADAM17 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan et al., 2016</xref>), and IL-6 expression in colonic myeloid CD11b-positive cells depends on the presence of the EGF-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>), we decided to analyze a possible role of the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway in tumorigenesis. This hypothesis was supported by our gene expression data, which showed that in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice, Wnt and STAT3 regulated genes were significantly down-regulated in the absence of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that IL-6 is involved in the homeostasis of intestinal crypts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffery et al., 2017</xref>) and that tumor formation in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model was reduced on an IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baltgalvis et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>IL-6 trans-signaling can be specifically blocked by a soluble form of gp130 dimerized via a human IgG1 Fc (sgp130Fc) without affecting classic IL-6 signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jostock et al., 2001</xref>). We previously generated transgenic mice (sgp130Fc-tg mice) that expressed the sgp130Fc protein under the transcriptional control of a liver-specific promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rabe et al., 2008</xref>). These mice were shown to be completely resistant to IL-6 trans-signaling–mediated pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lesina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kraakman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmann et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore compared tumor formation in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>, Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::IL-6<sup>−/−</sup>, and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::sgp130Fc-tg mice. There was no significant difference in the onset of tumor formation at 100 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>), as indicated by both tumor number and tumor size. However, as tumors progressed to 150 and 200 d, Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice on the IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> and sgp130Fc-tg genetic background showed similarly reduced tumor numbers and tumor areas. Although tumor numbers were initially lower in the absence of IL-6 classic and trans-signaling on the IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>), after 200 and 300 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, E–H</xref>), a time point when few Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice were still alive, Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::sgp130Fc-tg mice showed strongly reduced tumor numbers and tumor sizes, indicating that IL-6 via the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway was involved in the later stages of Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> tumorigenesis. IHC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 I</xref>) revealed a tendency to more intensive staining for pSTAT3 and pEGF-R in tumors compared with unaffected tissues. Tumors of Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice exhibited more pEGF-R reactivity than Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::sgp130Fc-tg mice. In agreement with the experimental data shown in Fig. S4, there was no clear difference in infiltrating CD3-positive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 I</xref>) and F4/80 macrophages (not depicted) in tumors of Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>, Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::sgp130Fc-tg mice.

Here we show that in vitro and in vivo, EGF-R activation requires ADAM17 activity, which acts via shedding of membrane-bound EGF-R ligands. Furthermore, we show that tumorigenesis in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model, which is known to require EGF-R activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2002</xref>), is largely suppressed in the absence of ADAM17. Interestingly, this is not a result of reduced tumor progression, since the few tumors seen in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice are of the same mean size as those seen in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> control mice. Moreover, in the absence of ADAM17, the detected tumors were classified as low-grade dysplasias, whereas in the presence of ADAM17, high-grade dysplasias and carcinomas were also detected. Based on the recent finding that EGF-R on myeloid cells rather than on intestinal epithelial cells is required for tumor formation in the AOM/DSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardbower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>) and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>) models, we demonstrate in two different intestinal tumor models a link between EGF-R, ADAM17, and IL-6, indicating that IL-6 trans-signaling is needed for efficient tumor formation in the intestine.</p><p>The ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mouse, with its massive reduction of ADAM17 protein levels in all tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>), has been used successfully to study the role of ADAM17 in various in vivo models including kidney fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kefaloyianni et al., 2016</xref>), atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicolaou et al., 2017</xref>), and small vessel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capone et al., 2016</xref>). With its residual ADAM17 activity, the ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mouse can serve as a model for the consequences of pharmacological inhibition of ADAM17, which will not lead to complete blockade of enzymatic activity. It has been shown that in ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice, intestinal barrier function is compromised upon challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>). In the present study, we also demonstrate that, even without a challenge, the microbiome of ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice is significantly changed compared with WT mice, indicating that by affecting the abundance of butyrate-producing bacterial taxa, ADAM17 may contribute to intestinal barrier function.</p><p>IL-6 plays a dual role in intestinal homeostasis. On the one hand, in the absence of IL-6, inflammation upon challenge with DSS is more severe because of compromised regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grivennikov et al., 2009</xref>). This is likely caused by reduced IL-6–stimulated STAT3 activation in response to the irritant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grivennikov et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, IL-6 is important for intestinal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffery et al., 2017</xref>), and recombinant IL-6 improved colitis in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spehlmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, IL-6 via IL-6 trans-signaling drives the inflammatory response in colitis, and sgp130Fc was sufficient to efficiently block inflammation in several colitis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atreya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitsuyama et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, it was shown in two different inflammation-associated colon cancer models that blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsumoto et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>One important activity of ADAM17 is shedding of the IL-6R, which is a prerequisite of IL-6 trans-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Riethmueller et al., 2017</xref>). It was surprising that blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling was sufficient for inhibition of tumor formation in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model. IL-6 deficiency led to a decreased tumor load in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baltgalvis et al., 2008</xref>), and we showed in the present study that IL-6 mRNA was massively up-regulated in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice and down-regulated in the absence of ADAM17. Because blocking IL-6 trans-signaling was sufficient to strongly reduce tumor formation, these results now help to explain the unexpected observation that EGF-R on myeloid cells but not on intestinal epithelial cells was needed for tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardbower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>). This notion is also supported by a recent study of mice with epithelial-specific ADAM17 deletion. In these mice, AOM treatment led only to a slight reduction of adenomas and cancer compared with the dramatic reduction in tumor incidence upon blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mustafi et al., 2017</xref>). EGF-R stimulation on myeloid cells leads to IL-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>), and ADAM17 is needed for the cleavage of ligands of EGF-R such as amphiregulin. At the same time, ADAM17 is needed for shedding of the IL-6R from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, IL-6 induction and sIL-6R generation are both induced by ADAM17 activity, leading to stimulation of the intestinal epithelial cells via IL-6 trans-signaling.</p><p>Frequent somatic activating mutations in gp130 have been detected in inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rebouissou et al., 2009</xref>). When such activated gp130 was expressed as a transgene in intestinal epithelial cells, proliferation and aberrant differentiation of these cells was observed, which depended on the activity of the transcriptional coactivator Yap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taniguchi et al., 2015</xref>). When these transgenic mice were crossed with Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice, the animals developed very high tumor numbers in the jejunum and ileum. Tumor incidence was dramatically reduced in the absence of STAT3 and Yap, indicating that gp130 activation is crucial for tumor development in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taniguchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The important role of myeloid EGF-R activation in intestinal tumorigenesis, at least in mice, was unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardbower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>), although it was known that both M1 and M2 macrophages are activated by EGF-R stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardbower et al., 2016</xref>). M1 macrophages are thought to be proinflammatory and antitumorigenic, whereas M2 macrophages are believed to act in a regenerative and protumorigenic fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardbower et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, differentiation of M2 macrophages requires IL-6 signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauer et al., 2014</xref>), pointing to a plausible link between EGF-R and IL-6 in the intestine.</p><p>In patients with unresectable metastatic colon cancer, besides chemotherapy, EGF-R blockade by the neutralizing antibodies cetuximab and pantuximab is applied. In the investigated and analyzed patient cohorts of the present study, cetuximab was rarely administered, and then only in the context of combinatorial treatment protocols. Thus, statistical analyses of treatment response related to ADAM17 expression was renounced because of underpower and hardly objectifiable response rates according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) after multisubstance treatments.</p><p>The majority of patients, which can account for up to 90%, show intrinsic resistance against anti–EGF-R antibodies as a result of KRAS mutations or mutations in other signaling pathways, such as BRAF or PIK3CA, which all lie downstream of the EGF-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Emburgh et al., 2014</xref>). But even patients who respond to anti–EGF-R antibodies benefit from the treatment for only 3–12 mo because of acquired resistance mechanisms, which include mutations in the EGF-R precluding binding of cetuximab or amplification of the gene coding for the ErbB family member HER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Emburgh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this light, it is provocative that, although depending on EGF-R activity, colon cancer seems to require IL-6 trans-signaling. As we have shown, EGF-R stimulation of CD11b-positive colonic myeloid cells led to massive IL-6 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>), and sIL-6R is generated by these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsukamoto et al., 2017</xref>). We showed in pancreatic cancer that IL-6 trans-signaling, in addition to oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic>, is required for progression to ductal adenocarcinoma, and this progression was completely blocked in sgp130Fc transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lesina et al., 2011</xref>). The reduction in tumor load seen after blocking IL-6 signaling was less pronounced than the effect in ADAM17-deficient mice. Furthermore, it still needs to be determined whether a similar mechanism also operates in humans. Nevertheless, blocking IL-6 trans-signaling might be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colon cancer that would not be affected by intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGF-R blockade.</p></sec><sec id="s11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s12"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were kept under barrier conditions in individually ventilated cages with species-appropriate husbandry in a 12-h light-dark cycle under standard conditions.

For permeabilization, slides were incubated with 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 5 min. Specimens were blocked in 100 µl serum-free protein block (Dako; Agilent Technologies). Primary antibodies were diluted as recommended in antibody dilution solution (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at 4°C overnight. After washing in PBS, the fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody was added in the dark. Sections were washed again in PBS in the dark before being mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). If the protein of interest was targeted by an HRP-labeled secondary antibody, a DAB-substrate solution (0.05% DAB, 0.015% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.2) was used to visualize labeled proteins.

Chronic intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Terzic et al., 2010</xref>) and elevated activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) have been associated with increased risk of CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sibilia et al., 2007</xref>). CRCs arise after the loss of tumor suppressor genes, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), from intestinal epithelial stem cells that reside at the base of the crypt. This is followed by a stepwise accumulation of mutations in oncogenes, such as the Kirsten rat sarcoma virus oncogene <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996</xref>). The standard of care for unresectable metastatic CRC includes chemotherapy combined with neutralizing antibodies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or EGF-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tobin et al., 2015</xref>). Because overexpression of EGF-R is found in the majority of CRC patients, therapeutic inhibition of this signaling cascade is a seemingly obvious treatment option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haraldsdottir and Bekaii-Saab, 2013</xref>). However, it is now clear that EGF-R–blocking antibodies, including cetuximab or pantuximab, are beneficial only in patients who do not harbor <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linardou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tobin et al., 2015</xref>). Unfortunately, even in <italic>KRAS</italic> WT patients with an initial response, resistance against EGF-R blockade almost invariably occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pietrantonio et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CRC are warranted.</p><p>The receptor tyrosine kinase EGF-R controls proliferation, differentiation, gastric barrier function, and cellular survival, highlighting a driving role in various epithelial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sibilia et al., 2007</xref>). EGF-R belongs to a family of four receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>), which are engaged by 11 different ligands, leading to activation of several signaling pathways often involved in cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>). Each of the ligands for EGF-R is synthesized as a transmembrane precursor protein, which needs to be cleaved to act systemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blobel, 2005</xref>). This cleavage is performed by members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, with most ligands cleaved by the protease ADAM17, which is a membrane-bound metalloprotease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moss et al., 1997</xref>). To date, more than 80 different substrates have been reported for ADAM17, including TNFα, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), L-selectin, and both TNFα receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scheller et al., 2011a</xref>). As such, ADAM17 regulates the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway through generation of the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan et al., 2016</xref>), which drives most of the proinflammatory activities of the cytokine IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rose-John et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Systemic ADAM17 knockout mice are not viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peschon et al., 1998</xref>). For this reason, we previously generated hypomorphic ADAM17 mice by inserting an additional exon into the <italic>ADAM17</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>). The new exon starts with an in-frame stop codon that is flanked by splice donor/acceptor sites, which slightly deviate from the canonical consensus sequence. This novel strategy resulted in viable mice, called ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice, with significantly reduced ADAM17 protein levels and no detectable cleaving activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>). ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice have eye, hair, and skin defects resembling those in TGFα<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, in ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice, milk duct formation in the female breast, which is known to be EGF-R dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sternlicht et al., 2005</xref>), was severely compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, upon challenge with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice exhibited defective regeneration of the colonic epithelium, which could be overcome by administration of recombinant EGF-R ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>). From these observations, we hypothesized that in ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice, EGF-R activity was largely abrogated by a lack of EGF-R ligand shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atreya et al., 2000</xref>) and intestinal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grivennikov et al., 2009</xref>). On target cells, IL-6 binds to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and the complex of IL-6 and IL-6R binds to the ubiquitously expressed signaling receptor subunit gp130, which upon dimerization initiates intracellular signaling via the STAT3 and ERK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheller et al., 2011b</xref>). Cells that do not express IL-6R cannot respond to IL-6 but can be stimulated by IL-6 bound to a soluble form of the IL-6R (sIL-6R). This signaling pathway, termed IL-6 trans-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rose-John and Heinrich, 1994</xref>), is essential for colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atreya et al., 2000</xref>) and other inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we analyzed the role of ADAM17 in the development of colon cancer using the <italic>APC</italic><sup>Min/+</sup> model of familial adenomatous polyposis, where a heterozygous germ line truncation in the <italic>apc</italic> gene results in the development of small and large intestinal tumors after the spontaneous loss of heterozygosity of the remaining <italic>apc</italic> WT allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamada and Mori, 2007</xref>). We found that in the absence of ADAM17, not only was tumor formation abrogated, but also the few residual tumors detected in ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice were of low-grade dysplasia. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that tumor formation required sIL-6R–dependent IL-6 trans-signaling, since it could be inhibited with the IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitory protein sgp130Fc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jostock et al., 2001</xref>). These results suggest that blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling may be a novel CRC therapeutic strategy that could circumvent intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGF-R blockade.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Expression of EGF-R, but not ADAM17, is a prognostic factor for metastatic CRC</title><p>Because EGF-R activation requires ADAM17 activity, we analyzed 361 (for ADAM17) and 330 (for EGF-R) human tissue microarray samples from patients with Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage II–III surgically resected CRC for EGF-R and ADAM17 expression. In Fig. S1 A, we show representative examples for both proteins expressed at various levels. Fig. S1 (B and C) depicts the highly variable distribution of EGF-R and ADAM17 expression. As reported, overall survival was significantly higher in patients with no, low, and intermediate EGF-R expression compared with patients with high EGF-R expression (Fig. S1 D). However, no significant correlation between ADAM17 expression or ADAM17-positive stained cells and overall survival was detected (Fig. S1 E). This was not completely unexpected, since ADAM17 mRNA is found in virtually all cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scheller et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thul et al., 2017</xref>) and regulation of ADAM17 activity occurs mainly at the posttranslational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sommer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>).

In HCA-7 cells, we detected only EGF-R mRNA, but no expression of other ErbB receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), highlighting that EGF-R is the dominant ErbB family member present. In addition, HCA-7 cells expressed the EGF-R ligands betacellulin, EGF, amphiregulin, and epiregulin but not the Erb3/4 ligand neuregulin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that EGF-R was strongly autophosphorylated in HCA-7 colon adenocarcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) without exogenous stimulation. This was dependent on the activity of ADAM17 because the inhibition of the ADAM family member ADAM10 with GI254023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hundhausen et al., 2003</xref>) did not reduce EGF-R phosphorylation, whereas treatment with GW280264, which blocks both ADAM10 and ADAM17 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hundhausen et al., 2003</xref>) strongly reduced EGF-R phosphorylation to the same extent as the pan-metalloprotease inhibitor marimastat or the EGF-R kinase inhibitor AG1478 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou and Brattain, 2005</xref>).

We conclude from these experiments that ADAM17 activity is needed for constitutive EGF-R activation in these colon adenocarcinoma cells, and that this was most likely caused by ADAM17-mediated shedding of EGF-R ligands such as amphiregulin in a process that has been termed trans-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prenzel et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>Size of small-intestine organoids from Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice is altered by the absence of ADAM17</title><p>Having shown that ADAM17 activity was a prerequisite of EGF-R activation in HCA-7 human colon adenocarcinoma cells, we decided to study Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice, which have only one functional allele of the tumor suppressor Apc.

intestinal microbiome strongly affects barrier function and tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O’Keefe, 2016</xref>). Because ADAM17 is needed for proper intestinal barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>), we wondered whether the absence of ADAM17 would have an influence on the composition of the intestinal microbiome. We profiled the fecal microbiome from unchallenged WT and ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice by analyzing the DNA sequence encoding the 16S rRNA. Multidimensional scaling revealed distinct clustering between WT, heterozygous ADAM17<sup>wt/ex</sup>, and homozygous ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice (Fig. S5 A). Significant changes were observed by operational taxonomical unit analysis of the respective genotypes depicted by heat map (Fig. S5 B). Interestingly, several bacterial taxa were depleted in the hypomorphic ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> animals, which are involved in fermentation of dietary fiber into butyrate (<italic>Coprococcus</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>; Fig. S5 B), a metabolic process protecting from colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byndloss et al., 2017</xref>). Similar shifts in abundances have been detected in human CRC patients. Altogether, these data indicate that without any additional stimulus or pathological condition, the absence of ADAM17 has a remarkable effect on constitution of the intestinal microbiota, which might relate to the altered epithelial gene expression and contribute to tumorigenesis. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S5 C, inferred Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) categories in <sc>d</sc>-arginine, <sc>d</sc>-ornithine metabolism and inositol phosphate metabolism were significantly different between WT and ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice. These metabolites are considered to be important for the maintenance of intestinal barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glover et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s09"><title>Tumor formation in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model is dependent on IL-6 trans-signaling</title><p>EGF-R activity in myeloid cells is needed for tumorigenesis in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>) as well as in an inflammation-associated CRC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardbower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>). Because the sIL-6R is generated via limited proteolysis by the ADAM17 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan et al., 2016</xref>), and IL-6 expression in colonic myeloid CD11b-positive cells depends on the presence of the EGF-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>), we decided to analyze a possible role of the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway in tumorigenesis. This hypothesis was supported by our gene expression data, which showed that in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice, Wnt and STAT3 regulated genes were significantly down-regulated in the absence of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that IL-6 is involved in the homeostasis of intestinal crypts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffery et al., 2017</xref>) and that tumor formation in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model was reduced on an IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baltgalvis et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>IL-6 trans-signaling can be specifically blocked by a soluble form of gp130 dimerized via a human IgG1 Fc (sgp130Fc) without affecting classic IL-6 signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jostock et al., 2001</xref>). We previously generated transgenic mice (sgp130Fc-tg mice) that expressed the sgp130Fc protein under the transcriptional control of a liver-specific promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rabe et al., 2008</xref>).

We therefore compared tumor formation in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>, Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::IL-6<sup>−/−</sup>, and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::sgp130Fc-tg mice. There was no significant difference in the onset of tumor formation at 100 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>), as indicated by both tumor number and tumor size. However, as tumors progressed to 150 and 200 d, Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice on the IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> and sgp130Fc-tg genetic background showed similarly reduced tumor numbers and tumor areas. Although tumor numbers were initially lower in the absence of IL-6 classic and trans-signaling on the IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>), after 200 and 300 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, E–H</xref>), a time point when few Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice were still alive, Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::IL-6<sup>−/−</sup> and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::sgp130Fc-tg mice showed strongly reduced tumor numbers and tumor sizes, indicating that IL-6 via the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway was involved in the later stages of Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> tumorigenesis. IHC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 I</xref>) revealed a tendency to more intensive staining for pSTAT3 and pEGF-R in tumors compared with unaffected tissues.

Here we show that in vitro and in vivo, EGF-R activation requires ADAM17 activity, which acts via shedding of membrane-bound EGF-R ligands. Furthermore, we show that tumorigenesis in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model, which is known to require EGF-R activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2002</xref>), is largely suppressed in the absence of ADAM17. Interestingly, this is not a result of reduced tumor progression, since the few tumors seen in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>::ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice are of the same mean size as those seen in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> control mice. Moreover, in the absence of ADAM17, the detected tumors were classified as low-grade dysplasias, whereas in the presence of ADAM17, high-grade dysplasias and carcinomas were also detected. Based on the recent finding that EGF-R on myeloid cells rather than on intestinal epithelial cells is required for tumor formation in the AOM/DSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardbower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>) and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>) models, we demonstrate in two different intestinal tumor models a link between EGF-R, ADAM17, and IL-6, indicating that IL-6 trans-signaling is needed for efficient tumor formation in the intestine.</p><p>The ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mouse, with its massive reduction of ADAM17 protein levels in all tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>), has been used successfully to study the role of ADAM17 in various in vivo models including kidney fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kefaloyianni et al., 2016</xref>), atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicolaou et al., 2017</xref>), and small vessel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capone et al., 2016</xref>). With its residual ADAM17 activity, the ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mouse can serve as a model for the consequences of pharmacological inhibition of ADAM17, which will not lead to complete blockade of enzymatic activity. It has been shown that in ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice, intestinal barrier function is compromised upon challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>). In the present study, we also demonstrate that, even without a challenge, the microbiome of ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice is significantly changed compared with WT mice, indicating that by affecting the abundance of butyrate-producing bacterial taxa, ADAM17 may contribute to intestinal barrier function.</p><p>IL-6 plays a dual role in intestinal homeostasis. On the one hand, in the absence of IL-6, inflammation upon challenge with DSS is more severe because of compromised regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grivennikov et al., 2009</xref>). This is likely caused by reduced IL-6–stimulated STAT3 activation in response to the irritant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grivennikov et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, IL-6 is important for intestinal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffery et al., 2017</xref>), and recombinant IL-6 improved colitis in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spehlmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, IL-6 via IL-6 trans-signaling drives the inflammatory response in colitis, and sgp130Fc was sufficient to efficiently block inflammation in several colitis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atreya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitsuyama et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, it was shown in two different inflammation-associated colon cancer models that blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsumoto et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>One important activity of ADAM17 is shedding of the IL-6R, which is a prerequisite of IL-6 trans-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Riethmueller et al., 2017</xref>). It was surprising that blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling was sufficient for inhibition of tumor formation in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model. IL-6 deficiency led to a decreased tumor load in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baltgalvis et al., 2008</xref>), and we showed in the present study that IL-6 mRNA was massively up-regulated in Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice and down-regulated in the absence of ADAM17. Because blocking IL-6 trans-signaling was sufficient to strongly reduce tumor formation, these results now help to explain the unexpected observation that EGF-R on myeloid cells but not on intestinal epithelial cells was needed for tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardbower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>). This notion is also supported by a recent study of mice with epithelial-specific ADAM17 deletion. In these mice, AOM treatment led only to a slight reduction of adenomas and cancer compared with the dramatic reduction in tumor incidence upon blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mustafi et al., 2017</xref>). EGF-R stimulation on myeloid cells leads to IL-6 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>), and ADAM17 is needed for the cleavage of ligands of EGF-R such as amphiregulin. At the same time, ADAM17 is needed for shedding of the IL-6R from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, IL-6 induction and sIL-6R generation are both induced by ADAM17 activity, leading to stimulation of the intestinal epithelial cells via IL-6 trans-signaling.</p><p>Frequent somatic activating mutations in gp130 have been detected in inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rebouissou et al., 2009</xref>). When such activated gp130 was expressed as a transgene in intestinal epithelial cells, proliferation and aberrant differentiation of these cells was observed, which depended on the activity of the transcriptional coactivator Yap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taniguchi et al., 2015</xref>). When these transgenic mice were crossed with Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> mice, the animals developed very high tumor numbers in the jejunum and ileum. Tumor incidence was dramatically reduced in the absence of STAT3 and Yap, indicating that gp130 activation is crucial for tumor development in the Apc<sup>Min/+</sup> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taniguchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The important role of myeloid EGF-R activation in intestinal tumorigenesis, at least in mice, was unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardbower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>), although it was known that both M1 and M2 macrophages are activated by EGF-R stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardbower et al., 2016</xref>). M1 macrophages are thought to be proinflammatory and antitumorigenic, whereas M2 macrophages are believed to act in a regenerative and protumorigenic fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardbower et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, differentiation of M2 macrophages requires IL-6 signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauer et al., 2014</xref>), pointing to a plausible link between EGF-R and IL-6 in the intestine.</p><p>In patients with unresectable metastatic colon cancer, besides chemotherapy, EGF-R blockade by the neutralizing antibodies cetuximab and pantuximab is applied. In the investigated and analyzed patient cohorts of the present study, cetuximab was rarely administered, and then only in the context of combinatorial treatment protocols. Thus, statistical analyses of treatment response related to ADAM17 expression was renounced because of underpower and hardly objectifiable response rates according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) after multisubstance treatments.</p><p>The majority of patients, which can account for up to 90%, show intrinsic resistance against anti–EGF-R antibodies as a result of KRAS mutations or mutations in other signaling pathways, such as BRAF or PIK3CA, which all lie downstream of the EGF-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Emburgh et al., 2014</xref>). But even patients who respond to anti–EGF-R antibodies benefit from the treatment for only 3–12 mo because of acquired resistance mechanisms, which include mutations in the EGF-R precluding binding of cetuximab or amplification of the gene coding for the ErbB family member HER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Emburgh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this light, it is provocative that, although depending on EGF-R activity, colon cancer seems to require IL-6 trans-signaling. As we have shown, EGF-R stimulation of CD11b-positive colonic myeloid cells led to massive IL-6 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srivatsa et al., 2017</xref>), and sIL-6R is generated by these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsukamoto et al., 2017</xref>). We showed in pancreatic cancer that IL-6 trans-signaling, in addition to oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic>, is required for progression to ductal adenocarcinoma, and this progression was completely blocked in sgp130Fc transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lesina et al., 2011</xref>). The reduction in tumor load seen after blocking IL-6 signaling was less pronounced than the effect in ADAM17-deficient mice. Furthermore, it still needs to be determined whether a similar mechanism also operates in humans. Nevertheless, blocking IL-6 trans-signaling might be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colon cancer that would not be affected by intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGF-R blockade.</p></sec><sec id="s11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s12"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were kept under barrier conditions in individually ventilated cages with species-appropriate husbandry in a 12-h light-dark cycle under standard conditions.

Metascape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-cancers-12-00694">37</xref>] was used to identify enriched KEGG pathways of the focused clusters.

To investigate whether this gene overlap is associated with cell invasion, we first checked the presence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is often associated with tumor cell migration and invasion. A gene set enrichment on EMT genes showed a significant up-regulation for the toxins and RhoC after one day already, but not for RhoA overexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). RhoA overexpression induced a significant upregulation of some EMT genes (for example: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 (TIMP1)) after seven days, albeit the expression profile differed from that of RhoC (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, columns 5 and 6). To obtain a detailed insight, we plotted all genes that were significantly regulated after one day in either RhoC or RhoA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B, 5C</xref>, compare also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Among the transcripts that were consistently upregulated after RhoC but not RhoA induction, we found PLAU (Plasminogen activator, urokinase), SERPINE1 (Serpin Peptidase Inhibitor, Clade E, Member 1) as well as PTGS2 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2, Cyclooxygenase 2, COX-2), for example. Interestingly, these genes have been previously linked to migration of primary human keratinocytes as well as to differentiation of PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. The induction of pro-migratory genes of interest by toxin treatment was additionally validated by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The identified genes were reproducibly upregulated by Rho stimulation. For more information of all regulated genes, the microarray data, including the raw data, had been uploaded to Gene Expression Omnibus with the GEO ID GSE98244.

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared with the Ambion MessageAmp kit for Illumina arrays according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quality of cRNA was controlled using RNA Nano Chip Assay on an Agilent 2100 and hybridized to Illumina HumanHT12-v4 BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw microarray data were chip-wise processed using the Bioconductor R package beadarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] and subsequently quantile normalized together. Illumina Probes were mapped to reannotated Entrez IDs using the Illumina Human v4 annotation data (Version 1.26) from Bioconductor. If several probes mapped to the same Entrez ID, the one having the largest interquartile range was retained. Microarray data have been deposited in GEO under the access ID GSE98244. Differential gene expression analysis between treatment groups was calculated using the R limma package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Gene set enrichment analyses were performed with GAGE algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>], which tests whether a gene set is highly ranked relative to other genes. For functional annotation, we used genes sets from the human gene ontology (GO) as provided by the R/Bioconductor org.Hs.eg, db package (Version 3.1.2). Only gene sets having more than 5 and less than 500 genes were considered to retain those that are statistically robust and biologically informative.</p>

Despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, glioblastomas remain lethal, with a median survival below two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stupp et al., 2009</xref>). Glioblastoma is a heterogeneous disease, with extensive contributions from nontransformed cells and a cellular hierarchy within the neoplastic compartment. Atop the hierarchy resides a self-renewing, tumorigenic, stem-like tumor cell population called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>).

We selected four GSC models representing the major transcriptional glioblastoma subtypes—proneural, classical, and mesenchymal—and induced cellular differentiation through serum exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2006</xref>). We infected GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 5) with representative African (Dakar 1984) and American (Brazil 2015) ZIKV strains. 7 d later, spheres were obliterated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that greater than 60% of GSCs were infected by either strain at 48 h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). We analyzed the fraction of ZIKV-infected cells that expressed a GSC marker (SOX2); greater than 90% of infected cells were SOX2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>; and Fig. S1 A). Flow cytometry results were consistent with the microscopy data (Fig. S1, B–G) and demonstrated that the percentage of infected GSCs increased over time, consistent with virus spread. We next determined the impact of ZIKV on matched GSCs and DGCs. ZIKV could infect DGCs, but at a significantly lower rate than GSCs (Fig. S1, H and I). Infectious yield assays corroborated higher ZIKV levels from GSCs than from DGCs (Fig. S1, J and K). Whereas GSC proliferation was abolished by either ZIKV strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and G</xref>), DGCs were nearly unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Sphere formation in serum-free conditions has been used as a surrogate for self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reynolds and Weiss, 1992</xref>). Consistent with its preferential targeting of GSCs, ZIKV reduced GSC sphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>).

In contrast, GFAP<sup>+</sup> tumor cells were less infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, N and O</xref>). Effects on proliferating cell populations were measured by Ki-67 staining and BrdU treatment and staining.

To address the possible target specificity of ZIKV, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) comparing uninfected GSCs and DGCs and defined a group of differentially expressed immune genes, including type I IFN–stimulated genes (ISGs; Fig. S3). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that many ISGs were up-regulated in DGCs (Fig. S3, A and B). To further elucidate the signaling pathways that regulate ZIKV targeting of GSCs, we infected three GSC models (387, 3565, and 4121) with the ZIKV-Dakar strain for 36–48 h and then performed RNA-seq. IFN signaling was the top gene ontology pathway activated by ZIKV infection (Fig. S3, C and D). The RNA-seq data were validated by qPCR (Fig. S3 E). As ZIKV cannot fully antagonize ISGs, IFN responses may contribute to the specificity of ZIKV inhibition of GSC growth but more limited killing of DGCs or normal brain neurons and glial cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment of DGCs with a blocking antibody against IFN-α/β receptor 2 (IFNAR2) resulted in increased ZIKV infection (Fig. S3 F) and decreased relative cell number (Fig. S3 G).</p></sec><sec id="s09"><title>An attenuated ZIKV maintains effectiveness against GSCs and has additive effects with temozolomide chemotherapy</title><p>We previously reported a mutation of the flavivirus NS5 gene (E218A) that sensitizes the virus to translational inhibition by type I IFN and IFIT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>) resulting in attenuation in cells responsive to type I IFNs. To begin to enhance the safety features of a potential oncolytic ZIKV, we compared the tumoricidal effects of a wild-type ZIKV (FSS13025, Cambodia 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shan et al., 2016</xref>) and its recombinant derivative ZIKV-E218A against three GSC models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Both the parental and E218A mutant ZIKV strains displayed anti-GSC activity, as measured by cell viability and sphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). Although the parental ZIKV strain was more potent in reducing GSC growth, both strains were effective. Both the parental strain and the E218A-attenuated strain preferentially infected SOX2<sup>+</sup> tumor cells and induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C–H</xref>). Although tumor cells have the potential to activate the IFN response pathway, we still observed significant death of GSCs treated with ZIKV-E218A.

The reason for its tropism for specific cells is uncertain, as no definitive ZIKV receptor has been established. Our study is a first step in the development of engineered ZIKV as a glioblastoma therapy. Safety remains a paramount concern. The E218A mutant virus has two nucleotide changes in the same codon that abrogate the 2'-O methyltransferase activity in the NS5 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>) and attenuates its replication in cells responsive to type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>). Regression to pathogenic virus requires a low-probability event of concurrent nucleotide changes causing the exact amino acid reversion. Notwithstanding this, the E218A mutant virus represents a framework for further genetic modification to ensure safety and maintain efficacy. For example, second-site mutations in the 3′ untranslated region that affect production of a subgenomic RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donald et al., 2016</xref>) could further sensitize the virus to type I IFN.

This will require overcoming the technical challenges of creating patient-derived tumor models in more immunocompetent mice. We envision possible therapeutic use of modified ZIKV strains to target GSCs through orthotopic injection into the tumor beds of patients. Other modified viruses are under development to treat glioblastoma, including measles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hardcastle et al., 2017</xref>), polio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobrikova et al., 2008</xref>), and herpes viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheema et al., 2013</xref>).

29046763	          <p>Results: TEM shows vesicles of about 100 nm size for all samples. Proteomics analysis identified 346, 69 and 15 proteins as being unique to TgEV, ICEV and NICEV, respectively. When the common content from the three targets was analysed, a broad range of identified proteins correspond to classical EVs markers as annexins, HSP70, serpins, and tetraspanins. Data are available via ProteomeXchange (ID: PXD004895).</p>
29046763	          <p>Results: A series of 10 yeast knockout strains including Vps2âˆ†, Vps23âˆ†, Vps36âˆ†, Bro1âˆ†, Hse1âˆ†, Fks1âˆ†, Chs3âˆ†, Atg8âˆ†, Mrpl32âˆ† and Mst27âˆ† were established. Characterization and quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that ESCRT knockout and cell wall mutant EVs were altered in terms of protein amounts, morphologies, size and protein cargo compared to WT. Carbohydrate analysis of EVs revealed enrichment of glucose and mannose in Bro1âˆ† and Hse1âˆ† EVs. In spite of 85% proteome coverage in EVs, ESCRT components were found to be significantly depleted in yeast EVs. These results suggest that yeast EVs are significantly different from mammalian exosomes. Proteomic analysis highlighted the enrichment of cell wall remodeling enzymes, glucan synthase Fks1 and chitin synthase Chs3, especially in Vps2âˆ† and Vps23âˆ† EVs. To understand whether yeast EVs can remodel the cell wall, functional uptake assays were performed with WT and cell wall mutant (Chs3âˆ†) strains. Interestingly, EVs were able to protect WT and cell wall mutant strains from antifungal caspofungin and the plant defensin NaD1. However, EVs from Fks1âˆ† or Chs3âˆ† were unable to rescue the yeast cells from antifungals. Furthermore, the protection from antifungals were abrogated when EVs from Chs3âˆ† Vps23âˆ† double knockout strain were incubated with yeast cells. Co-culture of Chs3âˆ† strain expressing GFP and WT or Vps23âˆ† strain increased Chs3âˆ† strain survival upon caspofungin treatment.</p>

29326438	        <p id="Par38">Global RNAseq analysis from enriched mammary epithelial organoids from L1 was performed. Second and third mammary glands were used from wild-type and Nmi knockout mice (three mice per group) on the first day of lactation, minced and dissociated in digestion medium (Hank’s balanced salt solution containing collagenase I (Sigma Aldrich) (1 mg/ml) and Pronase (Sigma Aldrich) (0.1 mg/mL) for 2 h at 37 °C with shaking. Epithelial organoids were washed in PBS and enriched by pulse centrifugation to 1500 rpm at least three times before subsequent assays. mRNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500 using the latest versions of the sequencing reagents and flow cells. The quality of the total RNA was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Total RNA with a RNA integrity number (RIN) of ≥7.0 was used for the RNA library prep that started with two rounds of poly A+selection to isolate the mRNA. The SureSelect Strand-Specific mRNA library generation kit was used as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to generate the sequence ready libraries. The complementary DNA libraries were quantitated using quantitative PCR in a Roche LightCycler 480 with the Kapa Biosystems kit for library quantitation (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA) prior to cluster generation. mRNA sequencing was done on the Illumina HiSeq2500 with onboard clustering by loading 11 pM of the pooled libraries and paired end 50 bp sequencing by standard techniques (Illumina, Inc., San Diego CA, USA). Approximately 30 million reads were generated per sample. The accession code for the RNA Seq data deposited in GEO database is GSE104238.</p>

28858215	        <p>Since miRNAs regulate differentiation, cell renewal and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-cancers-09-00114">15</xref>], we looked for potential changes in miRNA expression that might occur upon CK2β depletion. Using microarrays with the miRNA probe set (Agilent miRNA human V.3), miRNA expression profiles were compared in ∆CK2β- and Mock-MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-09-00114">Table S1</xref>). These two cell lines were generated by shRNA-transduction as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-cancers-09-00114">9</xref>], in which less than 10% of the CK2β subunit remains in ∆CK2β-cells, whereas it was unchanged in Mock-cells (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-09-00114">Figure S1A,B</xref>). We found that several microRNA families were significantly reduced in ∆CK2β-cells (accession number GSE102266, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-09-00114-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, green bars). The relative miRNA amounts were determined by RT-qPCR using TaqMan probes, including miR-200c, miR-205, miR-141, as well as miR 30b and miR-34b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-09-00114-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The result confirmed the strong decrease of these miRNAs in ∆CK2β-cells. The miR-200 family including hsa-miR-200c, hsa-miR-205 and hsa-miR-141 emerged as the most significantly reduced miRNAs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Direct targets of miR-200c and miR-205 were reported to be the transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2 that regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-cancers-09-00114">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-cancers-09-00114">17</xref>]. We thus analyzed the protein expression level of ZEB1 in both cell types. Accordingly, we found that ZEB1 expression level was strongly increased in ∆CK2β-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-09-00114-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, left panel). It has been reported that a miR-30 reduction maintains self-renewal and inhibits apoptosis in breast tumour-initiating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-cancers-09-00114">18</xref>]. Of note, the expression of most members of the miR-30 family including miR-30b, -30c, and -30d, were also reduced in CK2β-depleted cells. A direct target gene of miR-30 is integrin β3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-cancers-09-00114">18</xref>]. Consistently, we found the upregulation of the integrin β3 protein in ∆CK2β-cells either by Western blot or by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-09-00114-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Members of the miR-34 family participate in the regulation of self-renewal and chemotherapeutic resistance of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-cancers-09-00114">19</xref>]. When compared to Mock-cells, miR-34 was also significantly reduced in ∆CK2β-cells. Collectively, these data show that ∆CK2β-cells exhibit a decreased expression of specific miRNAs that are all known to regulate de/trans-differentiation, EMT, cell renewal, and invasion.</p>
28858215	        <p>EMT in epithelial cells has been shown to be associated with stem cell traits and chemo-resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-cancers-09-00114">29</xref>]. Comparing ΔCK2β- to Mock-MCF10A cells, we looked further for individual gene expression signatures, using a transcriptomic analysis according to published profiles. Agilent microarrays were performed in duplicates, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-cancers-09-00114">9</xref>] (accession number GSE102265) and correlations were done with gene set collections from MSigDB 3.0, as described in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-09-00114">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. With this approach, we found that gene signature of Mock-MCF10A cells was correlated with the epithelial profiles while the ΔCK2β-MCF10A signature matched with mesenchymal profiles described in the Charafe, Sarrio, Gotzmann, and Jechlinger collections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-cancers-09-00114">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-cancers-09-00114">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-cancers-09-00114">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-cancers-09-00114">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-09-00114">Figure S2A</xref>). These data extended and confirmed our miRNA analysis together with our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-cancers-09-00114">9</xref>], and validated the process. Then, using the same approach, the signature of stem cell genes described as upregulated in Boquest, Lim and Pece data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-cancers-09-00114">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35-cancers-09-00114">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-cancers-09-00114">36</xref>], showed a “good” correlation with the one expressed in ΔCK2β-MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-09-00114">Figure S2B</xref>). Moreover, this ΔCK2β-upregulated gene signature also correlates with an invasive signature, depicted by Schuetz, Wang, or Poola profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-cancers-09-00114">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-cancers-09-00114">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-cancers-09-00114">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-09-00114">Figure S2C</xref>). Altogether, these global analyses prove that ΔCK2β-cells share many genes with stem cells, and suggest that they might exhibit cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties.</p>

27893716	        <p id="P24">All mouse experiments were performed in compliance with protocols approved by SUNY Upstate Medical University IACUC. Hic-5 floxed (Hic5<sup>F/F</sup>) mice were generated by the Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility of the University of Connecticut (Farmington CT, USA). The targeting vector was constructed such that exons 2–7 of Hic-5 Ensembl transcript, ENSMUST000000167965, were flanked with loxP sites. A Frt-PGK1-Neo-Frt positive selection cassette was inserted 3′ to exon 7. The targeting vector was introduced into 129/SvEv embryonic stem cells and homologous recombination was confirmed by G418 positive selection and Gangcyclovir negative selection. Embryonic stem cell aggregation was performed with CD1 morula and the resulting chimeric mice were screened for germline transmission of the targeting vector. The germline chimeric Hic-5<sup>+/F</sup> mice were then bred to ROSA26-Flp mice to remove the PGK1-Neo cassette. The resulting Hic-5 floxed mice were then crossed to transgenic HPRT-Cre mice to generate germline deletion of exons 2–7 of Hic-5 producing the Hic5 knockout allele. Hic-5<sup>+/−</sup> mice were then maintained by backcross to C57BL/6J and intercrossed to generation homozygote mutants. The Hic-5<sup>−/−</sup>;PyMT mice were maintained on a mixed genetic background (C57BL/6J and FVB/N). MMTV-PyMT mice were FVB/N and were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME).

29568378	        <p>U87MG cells harboring dox-inducible non-targeting shRNAs or TRIM52-targeting shRNAs were treated with dox (2 µg/ml) in biological duplicates for 5 days. GFP-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry using a FACS Aria (BD). 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were lysed using Trizol reagent (Fisher 15596-018) and total RNA was isolated as recommended. RNA quality was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher) and Bioanalyzer chip (Agilent, 5067-1511). Subsequently, 1µg of RNA was used for polyA enrichment and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) library preparation using a SENSE mRNA-Seq library prep kit V2 (Lexogen, 001.24) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The library was subjected to high-throughput sequencing single-end 50 bp on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform at the NGS unit of the Vienna BioCenter Core Facilities (VBCF) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://vbcf.ac.at">http://vbcf.ac.at</ext-link>). The reads obtained from the instrument were base called using the instrument manufacturer’s base calling software. Demultiplexing was performed using Illumina2bam (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://gq1.github.io/illumina2bam/">http://gq1.github.io/illumina2bam/</ext-link>). The reads were aligned against the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> reference genome (UCSC hg19 release) with STAR version 2.5.1b using the 2-pass alignment mode and reads mapping to ribosomal RNAs were removed. We obtained more than 80% uniquely mapped reads in each sample.

27808166	        <p>To biologically validate our dataset, we assessed the enrichment of the spatio-temporal gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>,c) in a published dataset of murine and human luminal and basal specific genes. We used a published expression data set of sorted mature luminal, luminal progenitor, mammary stem cell enriched (our basal population) and stroma cells from adult mouse and human mammary tissue (GEO series GSE19446 and GSE16997)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. We found a significant (p &lt; 0.01) enrichment of the Lim <italic>et al.</italic> mouse luminal and basal genes in our luminal and basal gene sets, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>,e). When we tested for conservation in human, we found a significant enrichment of the luminal populations in some of our luminal gene sets, and a more consistent, significant enrichment in the basal population as previously observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>,g). We also observed a significant enrichment of stromal genes in our basal gene sets. This was consistent with the published data set, where of the 1,257 basal genes identified, 277 (22%) were also identified in the stromal population. This suggests that the basal population expresses stromal genes, which may result from and assist with the communication between the two cell populations. This analysis demonstrates that our gene sets biologically validate with an independent enrichment of adult virgin cell subtypes and are conserved in human, confirming the identity of the enriched luminal and basal populations throughout the development of the mammary gland.</p>
27808166	        <p>We next questioned if LPAR3 activity directly mediates β-catenin activation. The protein results suggesting that β-catenin activation takes place in response to LPA exposure were confirmed at the mRNA level, as shown by a significant up-regulation of <italic>LPAR3</italic>, <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>LEF1</italic> in response to LPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). However, both <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>LEF1</italic> mRNA up-regulation was abrogated in siLPAR3 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The trajectory analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> results demonstrate that LPAR3 and β-catenin are co-expressed in mammary epithelial cells during early pregnancy and LPA exposure activates β-catenin in basal mammary epithelial cells through LPAR3 signaling. To further confirm that β-catenin signaling is active in the basal population during early pregnancy, we conducted an enrichment analysis of our gene sets in a dataset in which β-catenin was constitutively activated resulting in tumor formation (GSE43825). We found a significant enrichment (p &lt; 2.64 × 10<sup>−12</sup>) of genes upregulated throughout pregnancy in the basal population in the genes upregulated due to β-catenin activation even in the earliest stage of tumor formation, small hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The expression trajectories of these genes are depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>. To assess β-catenin signaling activation during early pregnancy, we proceeded to analyze mammary glands isolated from TcfLef-H2BGFP transgenic mice at P3.5 and pregnancy day 10.5 (P10.5). The P10.5 time point was selected given that mRNA expression level of <italic>Lef1</italic> and <italic>Tcf7</italic> that peak at P14.5 and P3.5 in basal cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Glands from P10.5 mice, not P3.5, show the presence of clusters of cells within the basal compartment with GFP positive nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, magenta staining) indicative of active β-catenin signaling. GFP positive cells co-localize with Lpar3 positive cells at P10.5 as shown by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, merged layers) supporting our proposed model of Lpar3 basal specific activation via β-catenin during the early stages of pregnancy. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis that β-catenin is active during pregnancy in the basal population, and we propose that its activation through Lpar3 signaling events initiate a basal to luminal differentiation process that, during early pregnancy, is necessary to populate the mammary gland with cells of the milk production lineage.</p>
27808166	        <p>We profiled a total of 47 samples for RNA-seq analysis, 3 biological replicates from each of the 2 cell subtypes across the 8 time points, with the exception of the lactation day 10 time point (only 2 biological replicates were assayed because of the low RNA yield). Due to the limited amount of RNA obtained from the sorted samples, the RNA was amplified using the Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA). We followed the system protocol to amplify 5 ng of RNA for each sample, 100–200 pg of RNA was used as a low control to detect non-specific amplification. The resulting double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was stored at −20 °C for long-term storage. The Covaris-S2 Series ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA) was used to fragment the ds-cDNA to around 300 bp. The libraries were made following the standard protocol for Illumina library preparation available online (http://www.einstein.yu.edu/docs/downloads/directional-transcriptome-seq.pdf). The protocol was followed with the exception of UNG treatment during the PCR amplification step.

30546420	      <p>Considering the strong relationship between CIN and aneuploidy, about a decade ago, a computational method was developed to represent aneuploidy in relation to the expression of genes localized in aberrant chromosomal region (functional aneuploidy profile). Thus, the functional aneuploidy as a measure of the total status of chromosomal imbalance, was inferred using gene expression data of a given tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-ol-0-0-9545">55</xref>). Carter <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-ol-0-0-9545">55</xref>) showed 70 genes whose expression was correlated with total functional aneuploidy in several cancer types: the CIN70 gene signature able to measure the state of karyotype and to predict clinical outcome in several human cancers. The CIN70 signature was obtained including most of genes involved in cellular processes critical for genome integrity maintenance such as DNA replication, chromosomal condensation, segregation, de-condensation and structure and genes of cell cycle, spindle apparatus and mitosis. Carter's study provided a means to assess the potential role of CIN in tumors initiation. However, in this study NB tumor was not investigated and CIN signature for NB has not been identified until now. Since this information is lacking, we explored gene expression profiles of 504 NB derived from public dataset E-MTAB-161 (EMBL ArrayExpress database). This dataset provided expression data of 45 genes out of 70 genes included in the CIN70 signature. Patients clinical information was used to define two risk groups: HR group including samples with stages 2, 3, 4 and 4s <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified, stage 4 <italic>MYCN</italic> not amplified &gt;12 months at diagnosis; low/intermediate-risk (LIR) group including samples with stages 2, 3 and 4S without <italic>MYCN</italic> gene amplified, stage 4 without <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification &lt;12 months at diagnosis. We observed 31/45 genes differently expressed between HR and LIR groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ol-0-0-9545">Fig. 2</xref>). These genes show association with cell-cycle regulation (<italic>CCNB1, PRC1</italic> and <italic>TPX2</italic>) and chromosomal segregation (<italic>TPX2</italic>). Furthermore, we found overexpression of key regulators genes involving in the correct processes of chromosomes replication, regulation of chromatin status, cytokinesis and segregation; namely: <italic>AURKB, CCNB1, CCNB2, NEK2</italic> and <italic>ZWINT</italic> and likely associated with CIN in HR-NB patients. Interestingly, we observed genes with the highest CIN score reported in Carter's study, among genes with high expression in HR-NBs, such as <italic>TPX2</italic> and <italic>PRC1</italic>.</p>

31601814	        <p id="Par7">Consistent with the previous reports, analyses of public datasets suggested that BRG1 mRNA was reduced in IBD specimens as compared with those in healthy controls (using datasets from NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE9452 and GSE3365; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). To validate these data in IBD, we performed quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays to determine BRG1 expression in colonic biopsy specimens from CD and UC patients as well as from normal controls. Compared with the levels in biopsies from healthy specimens, we showed that BRG1 mRNA levels were markedly decreased in the IBD biopsies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). To expand upon these observations, we also performed immunohistochemistry analyses using a pre-valuated BRG1 antibody to characterize the BRG1 expression on the cellular level. The quantification of the immunohistochemical results revealed that the protein levels of BRG1 in the colonic epithelial cells were significantly lower in the IBD specimens relative to that in the healthy subjects (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Together, these results suggest a causal link between BRG1 reduction and IBD pathogenesis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>BRG1 expression is decreased in IBD patients. <bold>a</bold> Box plot of BRG1 mRNA in healthy controls and IBD specimens (using dataset GSE9452 and GSE3365).

31601814	        <p id="Par16">To understand the mechanistic role of BRG1 in colonic homeostasis, we conducted an expression profile analysis using the IECs isolated from 7-week-old <italic>Brg1</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> and <italic>Brg1</italic><sup><italic>IEC</italic>-<italic>AKO</italic></sup> mice, a time point at which <italic>Brg1</italic> deletion did not led to colitis yet. Thus, expression alterations might reflect the primary effects of <italic>Brg1</italic> loss in colons. Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis of the expression profile indicated no prominent changes of the genes related to apoptotic regulation. However, there was a significant enrichment of genes linked to oxidoreductase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>). To validate this finding, we stained 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) to examine oxidative stress in colonic tissue and organoids, and detected that 8-OHdG level was indeed increased in the colons/organoids of 7-week-old <italic>Brg1</italic><sup><italic>IEC</italic>-<italic>AKO</italic></sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4c</xref>). Oxidative stress is associated with CRC pathogenesis, and ROS plays an important role in apoptosis induction under both physiologic and pathologic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, we studied the role of ROS in BRG1-mediated inflammation by staining using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), which is a fluorescent probe that reacts with ROS. To demonstrate a cell autonomous role of <italic>Brg1</italic> in the ROS homeostasis, the IECs were isolated from <italic>Brg1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup>, <italic>Villin</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic>-<italic>ERT2</italic></sup><italic>; Brg1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> or <italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>Brg/</italic>+</sup>, <italic>Brg1</italic><sup><italic>IEC</italic>-<italic>OE/</italic>+</sup> mice, and <italic>Brg1</italic> was similarly deleted by 4-OHT treatment. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that <italic>Brg1</italic>-deleted IECs (<italic>IEC</italic><sup><italic>Brg1</italic>-<italic>F/F; CreERT2</italic></sup>) produced significantly more amount of ROS relative to that in the <italic>IEC</italic><sup><italic>Brg1</italic>-<italic>F/F</italic></sup> cells, whereas the BRG1-overexpressing IECs (<italic>IEC</italic><sup><italic>Brg1</italic>-<italic>OE/</italic>+</sup>) exhibited restrained ROS production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5i</xref>). Similar to what we observed in the mice, the negative associations between BRG1 and the ROS signature were identified in the IBD clinical specimens (using datasets GSE11223, GSE3365, and GSE5795; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5j</xref>). Next, to clarify whether ROS elevation indeed led to apoptosis of <italic>Brg1</italic>-deficient IECs, we performed rescue assays by treatment of the <italic>Brg1</italic>-deficient IECs with an antioxidant, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). We found that NAC treatment reversed the cleaved caspase-3 signal to the levels similar to the control cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4d</xref>), arguing that excess ROS indeed contributes to the survival defects of <italic>Brg1</italic>-deficient IECs.</p>
31601814	        <p id="Par20">To distinguish between BRG1 binding sites and BRG1 functional sites genome-wide, we performed H3K9ac (a histone marker of active gene transcription) ChIP-seq in <italic>Brg1</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> and <italic>Brg1</italic><sup><italic>IEC</italic>-<italic>AKO</italic></sup> IECs. The ChIP-seq analysis revealed that 12573 genes possessed H3K9ac occupancies within 6 kb of annotated genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5h</xref>). The Venn diagrams indicated that there were still 685 genes overlapped (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6j</xref>). GO term analysis identified Autophagic vacuole fusion and Autophagic vacuole assembly pathways enriched in the 685 genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5i</xref>). To define the regulatory mechanism by which BRG1 controlled autophagy, we referenced the express profiles and ChIP-seq results, and examined expression levels of key autophagy-regulatory genes including <italic>Atg16l1</italic>, <italic>Wipi2</italic>, <italic>Atg7</italic>, and <italic>Ambra1</italic>. As expected, BRG1 loss and overexpression indeed down- and upregulated their expression levels in the IECs, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6k</xref>). Direct BRG1 and H3K9ac occupancies within the candidate gene loci were also seen in Genome Browser tracks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6l</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5j</xref>) and readily validated by the ChIP-qPCR assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6m</xref>). Consistent with the decreased BRG1 recruitment to these gene loci, H3K9ac was simultaneously reduced in the <italic>Brg1</italic>-depleted IECs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6m</xref>). Conversely, BRG1 overexpression enhanced the H3K9ac signals within the promoter regions of the <italic>Atg16l1</italic>, <italic>Wipi2</italic>, <italic>Atg7</italic>, and <italic>Ambra1</italic> gene loci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6m</xref>). Thus, <italic>Brg1</italic> loss led to a repressive chromatin status that directly repressed the transcription of the genes important for autophagosome initiation. Consistent with the GEM results, we found positive associations between BRG1 and ATG16L1, WIPI2, and AMBRA1 in the IBD biopsies (using datasets from GSE57945; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5k</xref>). Together, our results indicate that BRG1 modulates the multifaceted autophagy machinery to govern colon homeostasis.</p>

The ROS and BRG1signature were derived from GSE42476 and our own dataset. In order to define the degree of gene signature manifestation within profiles from external IBD datasets (e.g., GEO GSE11223), we used the previously described t-score metric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, which was defined for each external profile as the two-sided t-statistic comparing the average of the BRG1-induced genes with the average of the BRG1-repressed genes (genes within the human dataset were first centered to SD from the median of the specimens). For a given dataset, the t-score contrasted the patterns of the BRG1-induced genes with those of the BRG1-repressed genes to derive a single value denoting coordinate expression of the two gene sets. The correlation between BRG1 and ATG16L1, WIPI2b or AMBRA1 mRNA in IBD specimens (GSE57945, <italic>n</italic> = 38) is computed by nonparametric Spearman correlation.</p>

Interestingly, the analysis of the samples from the MSI vs. MSS group revealed that the level of NEIL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-01980-f007">Figure 7</xref>A–E), but not other BER proteins (NEIL1, OGG1, NTHL1, APEX1, Polb, and LigIII; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-01980-f007">Figure 7</xref>F–K), is significantly decreased in the MSS group compared to the MSI group. Collectively, these results indicate the role of NEIL2 in MSS-CRCs, where mismatch repair proteins are efficient.</p>

31894335	          <p>The expression of Psoriasin in BC was first evaluated using two gene array datasets. In the cohort (GSE3167) comprised of normal urothelium, superficial transitional cell carcinoma (STCC) without/with carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (CIS), invasive carcinoma, CIS and normal mucosa, the expression of Psoriasin was increased in the invasive carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-or-43-02-0562">Fig. 1A</xref>). This was further supported by analyses of Psoriasin in the other cohort of BC (GSE32549), which revealed an increased expression of Psoriasin in invasive BCs including both T1 and T2 tumours compared with Ta tumours which were confined within the innermost layer of the bladder lining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-or-43-02-0562">Fig. 1B</xref>). To investigate how Psoriasin expression may relate to clinical prognosis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed for Psoriasin expression in the TGGA BC cohort using an online tool (<uri ns0:href="http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/cgi-bin/" ns0:type="simple">http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/cgi-bin/</uri>).

31996670	        <p id="Par12">To better characterize the mechanisms underlying SMARCA4 in MB development, we have overexpressed OM and <italic>SMARCA4</italic> in human cerebellar progenitors (AF22 cells) and we checked the expression of several downstream genes of OTX2, c-MYC, and SMARCA4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a, b</xref>). Among the different analyzed genes, we found that OM affects <italic>CDKN2B</italic> and <italic>CRABP1</italic> expression and that SMARCA4 is able to rescue these effects (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). Notably, SMARCA4 loss of function does not influence <italic>CDKN2B</italic> and <italic>CRABP1</italic> modulation by OM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d, e</xref>). In line with our results, p15<sup>INK4b</sup> protein (encoded by <italic>CDKN2B</italic> gene) is a well-known oncosuppressor whose modulation by c-MYC and SMARCA4 has already been suggested in cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. CRABP1 protein binds to retinoic acid and helps to transport it into cells. Its role in human carcinogenesis is poorly understood, but high CRABP1 expression levels are associated with poor patient prognosis, high tumor grade in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and CRABP1 protein modulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction in mouse and human cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In Group 3 MB patients, <italic>SMARCA4</italic> gene presents several missense mutations (12 out of 131 patients) and the most common SMARCA4 mutation T910M (3 out of 12) has been already characterized in mouse fibroblast, human cell lines, and SMARCA4-deficient cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, but not in cerebellar progenitors. Furthermore, SMARCA4 T910M protein has been found normally incorporated into the BAF complex, but its ATPase activity is highly compromised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Since SMARCA4 T910M mutation is mainly present in heterozygosity, to analyze its function, we co-overexpressed (at comparable levels, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>) the wild-type and mutated form with OM. Interestingly, SMARCA4 T910M co-overexpression blocks the SMARCA4 wild-type effects on <italic>CDKN2B</italic> and <italic>CRABP1</italic> gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). To further characterize SMARCA4 T910M functions, we analyzed its effects in vivo. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f, g</xref>, SMARCA4 wt is able to block OM-induced MB while SMARCA4 T910M overexpression is able to counteract SMARCA4 wt effects. We further analyzed SMARCA4 T910M effects in human cerebellar organoids and as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6h</xref>, it is able to block the SMARCA4 wild-type effects also in this system. Taken together, these data suggest that in patients harboring heterozygotes <italic>SMARCA4</italic> missense mutations, SMARCA4 T910M represses SMARCA4 wild-type functions and acts as a dominant-negative.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Mutant SMARCA4 represses wild-type SMARCA4 functions.</title><p><bold>a</bold> mRNA expression analysis of human cerebellar progenitors (AF22 cells) 72 h after nucleofecion with pPBase + pPBVenus (V), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBVenus (OM), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBSmarca4wt + pPBVenus (OM + S). <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> qRT-PCR analysis of human cerebellar progenitors (AF22 cells) 72 h after nucleofecion with pPBase + pPBVenus (V), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBVenus (OM), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBSmarca4wt + pPBVenus (OM + S), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBSmarca4wt + pPBSmarca4 T910M + pPBVenus (OM + S + ST910M). <bold>d</bold> Western blot analysis of human cerebellar progenitors (AF22 cells) 72 h after nucleofecion with pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBVenus + pSCV2shCTRL (OM + shRNACTRL), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pSCV2shSMARCA4 (OM + shRNASMARCA4). <bold>e</bold> qRT-PCR analysis of human cerebellar progenitors (AF22 cells) electroporated with pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBVenus + pSCV2shCTRL (OM + shRNACTRL), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pSCV2shSMARCA4(OM + shRNASMARCA4). <bold>f</bold> NPR3 immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin staining of tumors in CD1 mice after transfection with pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBSmarca4wt + pPBSmarca4 T910M + pPBVenus (OM + S + ST910M). <bold>g</bold> Histograms show the percentage of mice that develop MB (3 months) after transfection at P0 with either OM, OM + S or OM + S + ST910M. <bold>h</bold> Quantification of cerebellar organoids GFP + /PCNA + cells at day 40 electroporated at day 35 with PBase + pPBVenus (V), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBVenus (OM), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBSmarca4wt + pPBVenus (OM + S), pPBase + pPBMyc + pPBOtx2 + pPBSmarca4wt + pPBSmarca4 T910M + pPBVenus (OM + S + ST910M). <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> At least <italic>n</italic> = 3 biologically independent experiments. <bold>e</bold>

32194720	          <p>SCGN protein expression was detected by IHC in 33 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens from patients with large cell lung carcinoma. IHC labeling was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ol-0-0-11336">13</xref>). Briefly, serial 4-µm thick sections were deparaffinized with xylol, rehydrated using an ethanol gradient (95, 70 and 50%), and heated for antigen retrieval in 5 mM Tris-HCl buffer for 15 min at 100°C. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and a 5% bovine serum albumin (cat. no. ST023-200g; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) solution was used to block non-specific binding. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C [anti-SCGN antibody (1:100; cat. no. sc-374355; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Syn, anti-CgA, anti-Napsin A (1:200; cat. nos. ab32127, ab15160 and ab187300, respectively; Abcam) and anti-CD56 antibody (1:200; cat. no. 99746s; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.)]. Subsequently, slices were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:100, cat. nos. P0612 and P0615, respectively; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated for 3 min at room temperature with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. Slices were examined using an Nikon microscope (magnification, ×20). For the negative control, primary antibodies were replaced with PBS. The method of Kawai was used to calculate a semi-quantitative score between 1 and 16 for the staining of each tissue core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ol-0-0-11336">15</xref>). The percentage of positive tumor cells in each core was estimated and values were assigned as follows: 1, ≤25%; 2, 25–50%; 3, 50–75%; and 4, ≥75%. The intensity of staining was determined where 1= none, 2= weak, 3= intermediate, and 4=strong. The first and second scores were then multiplied together resulting in a maximum staining score of 16, for any tissue core. Wilcoxon statistics were employed to analyze the data. Two pathologists reviewed the results independently.</p>

33236167	      <p id="Par593"><bold>Methods:</bold> Cases were identified in our pathology (n=2) and consultation files (n=20). Histological and immunophenotypic findings were reviewed. All cases were negative for melanocytic markers we use routinely (SOX10, S100, pan-melanoma, Melan A, HMB45) except for minimal foci (&lt;5%) of differentiation or immunoreactivity observed in a few cases.

Survival analyses were performed with R survival and prodlim packages on TCGA cohorts. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05 or False Discovery Rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05. The identified genes were validated by qPCR, Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry.</p>

33236167	      <p id="Par11275"><bold>Methods:</bold> DNA/RNA pairs from 32 lung cancer patients from NCT MASTER previously undergone WES were analysed: Sequencing using the nNGM-lung cancer hotspot panel and DNAs and corresponding RNAs were sequenced using the pan cancer TSO500/TST170 panel (Illumina). We wanted to evaluate the efficiency of panel-based sequencing vs WES to detect therapy-relevant alterations and to investigate their impact on therapy decision.</p>
33236167	      <p id="Par11276"><bold>Results:</bold> Sequencing of all samples applying both approaches is finished and data analysis is ongoing. 1. nNGM panel: Nine from 32 patients did not reveal any alterations. All except for four samples revealed the same relevant alterations identified by WES. Discrepancies might be due to the used hotspot gene panel design not covering the complete genes. Therapy relevant alterations in EGFR, BRAF, among others were identified. 2. TSO500/TST170: Data analysis is still ongoing, TMB assessment and MSI status is additionally collected. Finally, results will be sent blinded to NCT MASTER for clinical annotation. Recommendations based on the different sequencing approaches will be compared to the original decisions based on WES data.</p>
33236167	      <p id="Par11277"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Using different approaches for recommendations for therapy in oncology might have an impact on decision making. We therefore evaluated results from three different sequencing approaches, WES, nNGM hotspot gene panel sequencing and TSO500/TST170 hybrid-capture based sequencing and compared their putative influence on decision making. As expected, known therapy-relevant variants such as EGFR or BRAF mutations were detected applying all assays.</p>

To further determine whether TGF-β1 was contained in sEVs, we extracted proteins of BxPC-3 and BxPC-3-derived sEVs and performed western blot to detect the expression of TGF-β1. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>C, TGF-β1 was detected in both BxPC-3 and BxPC-3-derived sEVs. To track the process of BxPC-3-derived sEVs transporting TGF-β1 from BxPC-3 cells to T cells, we transfected tdTomato-CD63-BxPC-3 cells with a CMV promoter-driven EGFP-tagged TGF-β1 gene using a lentivirus vector system (TGF-β1/CD63-BxPC-3). tdTomato-CD63-BxPC-3 cells transfected with EGFP gene were considered as control (Ctrl/CD63-BxPC-3). We then extracted the TGF-β1/CD63-BxPC-3-derived sEVs (TGF-β1/CD63-sEVs) and Ctrl/CD63-BxPC-3-derived sEVs (Ctrl/CD63-sEVs) to stimulate the peripheral T cells. Green fluorescence was expressed more in TGF-β1/CD63-sEVs-T than that in Ctrl/CD63-sEVs-T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>D). Flow cytometry further determined that EGFP fluorescence was detected in TGF-β1/CD63-sEVs-T but not in Ctrl/CD63-sEVs-T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>E). These results indicated that TGF-β1 was carried by sEVs from BxPC-3 to T cells. To determine the specificity of sEVs-derived TGF-β1 for Treg induction, TGF-β1 inhibitor Disitertide (50μg/mL) was premixed with sEVs to competitively inhibit sEVs-derived TGF-β1. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>F, compared with sEVs-T, Disitertide reduced the induction of Tregs by sEVs. However, the proportion of FOXP3+ Treg was still higher in D+ sEVs-T than that in Ctrl-T. Despite the use of Disitertide, the induction of FOXP3+ Treg by sEVs was not completely suppressed. These results indicated that there existed other molecular mechanisms that were involved in inducing Treg.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Top Gene Sets Enriched in sEVs-T</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Gene Sets Name</th><th>NES</th><th>Nom p Value</th><th>FDR q Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TNF-α signaling via NF-κB</td><td align="char">2.675</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Inflammatory response</td><td align="char">2.38</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>p53 pathway</td><td align="char">2.253</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>IL-6 JAK STAT3 signaling</td><td align="char">2.247</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Hypoxia</td><td align="char">2.245</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>UV response UP</td><td align="char">2.199</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>KRAS signaling UP</td><td align="char">2.147</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Estrogen response late</td><td align="char">2.126</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Apoptosis</td><td align="char">2.126</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Epithelial mesenchymal transition</td><td align="char">2.103</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Xenobiotic metabolism</td><td align="char">2.069</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Estrogen response early</td><td align="char">1.992</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Coagulation</td><td align="char">1.935</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Apical junction</td><td align="char">1.928</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Interferon gamma response</td><td align="char">1.926</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0</td></tr><tr><td>Myogenesis</td><td align="char">1.864</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Glycolysis</td><td align="char">1.861</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>IL-2 STAT5 signaling</td><td align="char">1.858</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Allograft rejection</td><td align="char">1.849</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>TGF-β signaling</td><td align="char">1.846</td><td align="char">0.001</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Heme metabolism</td><td align="char">1.838</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Interferon alpha response</td><td align="char">1.833</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>KRAS signaling DN</td><td align="char">1.82</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Unfolded protein response</td><td align="char">1.812</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Spermatogenesis</td><td align="char">1.75</td><td align="char">0.003</td><td align="char">0.002</td></tr><tr><td>UV response DN</td><td align="char">1.747</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.002</td></tr><tr><td>Complement</td><td align="char">1.702</td><td align="char">0</td><td align="char">0.003</td></tr><tr><td>Angiogenesis</td><td align="char">1.699</td><td align="char">0.011</td><td align="char">0.003</td></tr><tr><td>Reactive oxygen species pathway</td><td align="char">1.69</td><td align="char">0.006</td><td align="char">0.003</td></tr><tr><td>Notch signaling</td><td align="char">1.674</td><td align="char">0.006</td><td align="char">0.004</td></tr><tr><td>Myc targets V1</td><td align="char">1.564</td><td align="char">0.003</td><td align="char">0.016</td></tr><tr><td>DNA repair</td><td align="char">1.445</td><td align="char">0.021</td><td align="char">0.047</td></tr><tr><td>Adipogenesis</td><td align="char">1.422</td><td align="char">0.025</td><td align="char">0.057</td></tr><tr><td>Oxidative phosphorylation</td><td align="char">1.376</td><td align="char">0.03</td><td align="char">0.081</td></tr><tr><td>mTORC1 signaling</td><td align="char">1.375</td><td align="char">0.042</td><td align="char">0.079</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tspara0015"><p>FDR, false discovery rate.</p></fn><fn id="tspara0020"><p>Nom p value &lt;0.05 and FDR q value &lt;0.25 meaning statistically significant.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

32314963	        <p>Human full-length wild type ERK3 (ERK3 WT) cDNA was purified from Human Kinase Library (Addgene). ERK3 WT pDONR-223 was used as a template to generate ERK3 K49A K50A kinase dead mutant. Site-directed mutagenesis was implemented by PCR using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Cat# MO491, New England BioLabs) and the following primers were used: frw_5’ <named-content content-type="sequence">GCAATTGTCCTTACTGATCCCCAGAGTGTC</named-content>, rev_5’ <named-content content-type="sequence">CGCGATGGCTACTCTTTTGTCACAGTC</named-content>. For lentiviral expression, ERK3 WT and ERK3 K49A K50A mutant in pDONR-223 were transferred into the destination vector pLenti4TO/V5-Dest by clonase reaction (Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix Cat# 11791–020, ThermoFisher Scientific). ERK3 WT and ERK3 K49A K50A mutant were also cloned into pcDNA3/V5-Dest40 vector for transient transfection purposes. For the production of lentiviral particles, the following packaging plasmids were used: pHDM-G (encoding VSV-G), pHDM Hgpm2 (encoding codon-optimized HIV gag-pol proteins), pHDM tat 1b (encoding HIV Tat1b protein) and pRC CMV-Rev1b (encoding HIV rev protein). Lentiviral particles were generated following standard protocols. In short, lentiviral supernatants were produced in 293 T cells by co-transfection of the cells with lentiviral packaging plasmids (0.3 µg each), lentiviral expression constructs (1 µg) and 10.8 µl of 10 mM polyethylenimine (PEI). The viral particles were harvested after 48 hr and sterile-filtered. HT-29, MDA-MB231 and HeLa cells were infected with lentiviral particles in the presence of 10 µg/ml of polybrene (Cat# sc-134220, Santa Cruz). Cells were then selected with puromycin (Cat# 0240.3, Carl Roth) at following concentrations: 3 µg/ml (MDA-MB231, HeLa) or 8 µg/ml for HT-29, until a stable knockdown was achieved. For complementation assays, empty vector control (pLenti4TO/V5-Dest), wild type or kinase dead (K49A K50A) mutant of ERK3 were reintroduced into shERK3 (3’UTR) background by lentiviral transduction and cells were double-selected with zeocin (100 µg/ml) (Cat# R25001, Invitrogen) and puromycin.</p>
32314963	        <p>HeLa cells stably transfected with shRNA targeting ERK3 at 3’UTR (shERK3) or with control empty vector shRNA (shCo) were transiently transfected with either an empty vector pcDNA3/V5-Dest40 (EV), ERK3 WT or ERK3 K49A K50A mutant construct (0.5 µg plasmid) in the presence of Lipofectamine2000 (Cat# 11668027, ThermoFisher Scientific) (3 µl/well). 6 hr post-transfection medium was exchanged for DMEM + FBS complete medium. 24 hr post-transfection medium was exchanged again for DMEM–FBS medium. 48 hr post-transfection supernatants were harvested for IL-8 ELISA and cells were analyzed by western blot.</p>

33010822	          <p id="p0260">To compare the transcriptome of CPOs to adult human choroid plexus tissue and hippocampal organoids (HOs), normalization steps were implemented to first make the data comparable. Human choroid plexus raw sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rodriguez-Lorenzo et al., 2020</xref>) was downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO: accession number GSE137619). The data was aligned to GRCh38.p12 and raw counts TPM-normalized to parallel CPO and HO datasets. TPM expression values were log<sub>10</sub>(TPM + 1) transformed for plotting individual gene expression values. To compare the whole transcriptome of CPOs to adult human choroid plexus tissue and HOs, raw counts were normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation (VST) using DESeq2 v1.24.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Love et al., 2014</xref>) and correlation analysis was performed by calculating Spearman correlation coefficients in the space of shared genes across the whole transcriptome of all datasets.</p>

H9 cells (~90% confluence) were cultured in 24-well tissue dishes for 3 days in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 100 ng/mL Activin A (R&amp;D Systems, 338-AC-050) and 2 μmol/L CHIR99021 (Tocris, 4423-10MG), followed by 4 days with 200 ng/mL Noggin (R&amp;D Systems, 6057-NG-100), 500 ng/mL FGF4 (Peprotech, 100-31-1MG), 2 μmol/L CHIR99021 and 10 μmol/L SB431542 (Tocris, 1614-10MG) in Advanced DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, 12634010). After 7 days’ treatment with above-mentioned factors, anterior foregut endodermal cells were embedded in a droplet of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, 356237) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 20–25 min. After matrigel solidification, cells were then fed with 20 ng/mL human BMP4 (R&amp;D Systems, PRD314-10), 0.5 μmol/L all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, Sigma-Aldrich, R2625), 3.5 μmol/L CHIR in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, 11320033) with 1% Glutamax (Gibco, 35050061), 2% B27 supplement (Life Technologies, 17504044) basal medium from day 8 to day 14. For preconditioning toward lung progenitor stem cell differentiation, NKX2-1<sup>+</sup> VAFE-enriched cells were cultured in the same basal medium supplemented with 3 μmol/L CHIR99021, 10 ng/mL human FGF10 (R&amp;D Systems, 345-FG-025), 10 ng/mL human KGF (novoprotein, CM88) and 20 μmol/L DAPT (Sigma, D5942) from day 14 to day 21. From day 21, human airway organoids (hAWOs) medium was prepared from Ham’s F12 (Gibco, 21127022) by supplementation with 50 nmol/L dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, D4902), 100 nmol/L 8-Br-cAMP (Biolog Life Science Institute, B007-500), 100 nmol/L 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Wako, 095-03413), 10 ng/mL KGF, 1% B-27 supplement, 0.25% BSA (Sigma, A1470) and 0.1% ITS premix (Corning, 354351). And human alveolar organoids (hALOs) medium was prepared by supplementing 3 μmol/L CHIR99021 and 10 μmol/L SB431542 to the human airway organoids medium. Organoids were transferred into new Matrigel droplets every 4–7 days using mechanical digestion.</p>

33147843	      <p>First described from the physiological changes observed in rat cardiomyocytes on Bion 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-ijms-21-08205">22</xref>] and salivary glands of rats on-orbit in Spacelab 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-ijms-21-08205">23</xref>], there is a growing body of work associating altered autophagic responses to spaceflight or microgravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-ijms-21-08205">21</xref>]. Many of the autophagic and lysosomal alterations are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-21-08205-t001">Table 1</xref>. These results are derived from observations of alterations to in vitro cell culture systems or the direct action of tail suspension (hindlimb unloading) in rodents on muscle/bone. Interestingly, non-exhaustive meta-analysis of mRNA microarray datasets from space-flown animals or cell lines show alterations in expression of endo-lysosomal or vesicular trafficking genes. For example, significant differential expression of endosome associated proteins such as Rab5 (early), Rab7 (late) and Rab11 (recycling) are observed in space flown mice (GSE94381 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-ijms-21-08205">24</xref>]) and mesenchymal stem cells (GSE100930 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-ijms-21-08205">25</xref>]), whilst various kinesins, dyneins or dynactins required for lysosomal trafficking also show significant differential expression. Further evidence of altered endo-lysosomal function during spaceflight is suggested by the near two-fold expression change of transcription factor EB (TFEB; GSE94381), a critical regulator in lysosomal biogenesis. Understanding the role of endosomes, lysosomes and autophagic processes in cellular function and disease pathogenesis in space environments may reveal novel physiological biomarkers and new therapeutic targets or countermeasures against space-related stressors and ageing-related pathologies.</p>

The protein concentration was adjusted to 1.0 mg/ml according to the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and printed on nitrocellulose-coated slides in four replicates (Grace Bio-Labs) using an Aushon Biosystems 2470 arrayer (Burlington). The following antibodies were used as probes: anti-phosphorylated MEK (Ser217/221) (CST9154), anti-phosphorylated ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) (CST4370), anti-phosphorylated EGFR (Tyr1068) (CST3777), anti-phosphorylated AKT (Ser473) (CST4060), and anti-MEK (CST8727). The specificity of the probe antibody was validated by immunoblot analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). All probe antibodies were visualized using anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to infrared dyes, IRDye 680RD (LI-COR, Biosciences). Anti-tubulin (clone 64, Sigma) was used as a control probe for each spot, followed by anti-mouse antibody conjugated to IRDye 800CW (LI-COR biosciences). The signal intensity of each spot was detected using an Odyssey scanner (LI-COR Biosciences), and the amount of phosphorylated protein was normalized to tubulin.</p>

32616845	        <p id="Par1">Grade 4 glioma or GBM has poor prognosis and is the most aggressive grade of glioma. Accurate diagnosis and classification of tumor grade is a critical determinant for development of treatment pathway. Extensive genomic sequencing of gliomas, different cell types, brain tissue regions and advances in bioinformatics algorithms, have presented an opportunity to identify molecular markers that can complement existing histology and imaging methods used to diagnose and classify gliomas. ‘Cancer stem cell theory’ purports that a minor population of stem cells among the heterogeneous population of different cell types in the tumor, drive tumor growth and resistance to therapies. However, characterization of stem cell states in GBM and ability of stem cell state signature genes to serve as diagnostic or prognostic molecular markers are unknown. In this work, two different network construction algorithms, Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and Multiscale Clustering of Geometric Network (MEGENA), were applied on publicly available glioma, control brain and stem cell gene expression RNA-seq datasets, to identify gene network regulatory modules associated with GBM. Both gene network algorithms identified consensus or equivalent modules, HuAgeGBsplit_18 (WGCNA) and c1_HuAgeGBsplit_32/193 (MEGENA), significantly associated with GBM. Characterization of HuAgeGBsplit_18 (WGCNA) and c1_HuAgeGBsplit_32/193 (MEGENA) modules showed significant enrichment of rodent quiescent stem cell marker genes (GSE70696_QNPbyTAP). A logistic regression model built with eight of these quiescent stem cell marker genes (GSE70696_QNPbyTAP) was sufficient to distinguish between control and GBM samples. This study demonstrates that GBM associated gene regulatory modules are characterized by diagnostic quiescent stem cell marker genes, which may potentially be used clinically as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in GBM.</p>
32616845	      <p id="Par6">Here, lists of quiescent and proliferative state stem cell signature genes were identified underlying GBM specific gene regulatory modules. Two network analysis methods, WGCNA and MEGENA, were utilized to build a glioma gene regulatory network and GBM associated sub-networks or modules based on gene–gene co-expression patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Both methods identified comparable GBM associated modules, which suggests that GBM modules identified in this study are biologically robust. GBM modules, HuAgeGBsplit_18 (WGCNA) and its equivalent c1_HuAgeGBsplit_32/193 (MEGENA), were enriched with quiescent stem cell signature genes (GSE70696_QNPbyTAP) and expression of these quiescent stem cell signature genes was sufficient to build a logistic regression diagnostic model capable of distinguishing between control and GBM samples. In summary, a set of quiescent stem cell markers enriched in GBM modules was identified with potential application in diagnostic GBM screening.</p>

32616845	      <p id="Par30">Network analysis facilitates grouping of genes with highly correlated gene expression patterns into modules. It is assumed that modules corelate with distinct biological and cellular states, such as diseases and cell types, respectively. Presently, network analysis identified 9 WGCNA modules and 20 MEGENA modules that were highly correlated with GBM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>B,F). One of these WGCNA modules, HuAgeGBsplit_18 WGCNA module (equivalent c1_HuAgeGBsplit_32/193 MEGENA modules) was also significantly enriched with adult hippocampal rodent quiescent stem cell genes (GSE70696_QNPbyTAP) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>B). Interestingly, though this quiescent stem cell marker enriched HuAgeGBsplit_18 WGCNA module (equivalent c1_HuAgeGBsplit_32/193 MEGENA modules) had a significant correlation with GBM (p-value 0.007) it had a small correlation value of 0.14 with GBM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>B). Possible reasons for this small but significant correlation are discussed here: (A) The result is consistent between WGCNA and MEGENA, two completely different network analysis algorithms. This supports that the results are biologically robust and not a computational artifact that would alter based on alterations in default algorithm settings. (B) SVA + LM normalization was used in this study to retain effects of glioma on gene expression and remove effects of all other covariants. It is possible that effects of covariants such as batch effects are not completely removed by this normalization, which is confounding glioma gene expression effects. (C) It is possible there are other covariants that significantly effect gene expression, such as patients’ comorbidities. However, as this information was not available, it could not be included in SVA + LM normalization and therefore glioma effects could not be effectively retained. (D) Controls used in this study comprise of RNA-seq datasets from different parts of the brain derived from humans other than the patients themselves. Ideally control tissue should be derived from the same patient who has the glioma, but presently such patient matched controls were not available for analysis. Lack of patient matched controls is a common challenge in the field of glioma and human disease research.</p>

33506057	        <p>To identify potential genes involving in tumor response to pCRT, the transcriptomic data from microarray datasets (GSE45404, GSE68204, and GSE87211) of rectal cancer patients receiving pCRT were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. According to the tumor regression grade (TRG) standard at the seventh edition manual of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), TRG1 and TRG2 are defined as response, and TRG3, TRG4, and TRG5 are defined as nonresponse or poor response. The GEO datasets were composed of 22 cases of nonresponders (NR) and 26 cases of responders (R) in GSE45404, 27 cases of nonresponders (NR) and 22 cases of responders (R) in GSE68204, and 160 cases of normal tissues and paired 203 cases of tumor tissues in GSE87211, respectively, which are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>.

We have found that there were nine genes significantly identified in upregulation of nonresponders to pCRT, including C6orf15, KRT23, COL2A1, FOLR1, FREM1, DACT2, NKD2, VSTM2L, and ZSCAN18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Among these candidate genes, VSTM2L gene was chosen for further investigation because its mRNA expression is significantly relative to both the survival time (OS) and disease-free time (DFS) in the GSE87211 dataset about rectal cancer patients receiving pCRT (Supplementary Figure (available <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">here</xref>)). VSTM2L was significantly downregulated in tumor compared to normal tissues in GSE87211 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>) and upregulated significantly in tumor tissues of nonresponders to pCRT in the GSE45404 and GSE68204 datasets (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(d)</xref>). To identify and validate the relationship between VSTM2L expression and tumor response of rectal cancer patients receiving pCRT, we have found that high expression of VSTM2L is positively correlated with poor tumor response through mRNA and protein level detection of six rectal cancer patients receiving pCRT (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(e)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(h)</xref>). The survival analysis revealed that high expression of VSTM2L is associated with poor prognosis in rectal cancer patients receiving pCRT (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(i)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(j)</xref>). In addition, the analysis of association between clinical characteristics and VSTM2L expression in 186 rectal cancer patients in GSE87211 showed that high expression of VSTM2L was significantly associated with tumor regression after pCRT (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). The high expression of VSTM2L may have potential to predict poor tumor response and prognosis in rectal cancer patients receiving pCRT.</p>
33506057	        <p>To explore the underlying downstream molecular mechanisms that VSTM2L overexpression induces resistance to CRT in cancer cells, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the microarray data from GSE45404, GSE68204, GSE87211, and VSTM2L-overexpressing RNA sequence. These datasets were classified into two groups according to the mRNA expression level of VSTM2L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>). The GSEA results showed that high expression of VSTM2L was mostly positively associated with genes involved in IL-4 signaling (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(c)</xref>). We then used our own VSTM2L-overexpressing RNA-Seq data to perform the pathway relative genes of IL-4 signaling and found that the mRNA level of 13 genes has appeared to significantly change (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), including 10 upregulated genes including CFLAR, ALOX5, SLC15A2, EGR1, KLF13, PMAIP1, SPAG1, HOMER2, ATXN1, and NCF2 and 3 downregulated genes including SLC39A8, ATPAF1, and PEG10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(d)</xref>). Among these significant genes of IL-4 signaling are CFLAR, ALOX5, PMAIP1, EGR1, NCF2, SLC39A8, and PEG10 which have been reported to be associated with tumor progression or chemotherapy-drug resistance through effecting proliferation and apoptosis in previous studies. And then, we further verified the impact of VSTM2L overexpression in those reporting proliferation and apoptosis relative genes of IL-4 signaling in LS.174T and SW837 cells; the results suggested that VSTM2L overexpression significantly upregulated the protein expression of CFLAR, ALOX5, PMAIP1, EGR1, and NCF2 and downregulated the protein expression of SLC39A8 and PEG10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(e)</xref>). Thus, we have identified that overexpression of VSTM2L induced resistance to CRT in cancer cells through downstream IL-4 signaling which could affect the progress of cell proliferation and apoptosis.</p>

Universal mouse Reference RNA (Agilent) was differentially labelled and hybridized to the tissue or cultured samples. A 4 × 44K Agilent Whole Mouse Genome dual colour Microarray (G4122F) was used. Labelling, hybridization and washing were performed according to Agilent guidelines. Microarray signal and background information were retrieved using the Feature Extraction software (V.9.5.3, Agilent Technologies). The hierarchical clustering analysis was performed in duct, acinar, islet and organoid arrays after <italic>in silico</italic> subtraction of the pancreas gene array. A cutoff of two-fold differentially expressed was used for the clustering analysis. GSEA was performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Subramanian et al (2005)</xref>.

22815884	            <p>A HEK293 cell line harboring stably integrated LGR4 and the STF reporter construct were incubated with conditioned media of a library of 2859 proteins known or predicted to be secreted. Firefly luciferase values were determined for each sample and normalized to Alamar blue values of the respective samples. Media + PBS and pcDNA DEST40: Negative controls, not expressing any secreted protein; recombinant RSPO1 samples, positive controls using recombinant RSPO1 at concentrations ranging from 0.1−240 ng/ml; RSPO1 pcDNA DEST40, positive control expressing RSPO1 cDNA; Sample: Combined dataset of all secreted (known or predicted) proteins, each protein assessed from conditioned media of duplicate cDNA transfections. RSPO1-4 proteins (black squares) scored highest. Then WNT proteins (red triangles) WNT1, WNT2, WNT3A, WNT7B and WNT8A reproducibly scored above a threshold of 10<sup>4</sup>.<sup>5</sup> that marks the upper range of the bulk of datapoints, whereas WNT2B, WNT5A, WNT5B, WNT6, WNT8B, WNT9B, WNT10A, WNT10B, WNT11 and WNT16 scored below; WNT3, WNT4, WNT7A and WNT9A centered around the threshold. Each dot, triangle or square represents the luciferase value of a unicate transfected cDNA construct. Shown is an aggregate display of the primary screen and hit confirmation analysis.</p>
22815884	        <p>HEK293T-LGR4-STF cells were plated into white, opaque matrix 384-well plates using standard lab automation, and were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. The secreted protein supernatant from the cDNA plate was transferred from the transfection plate (after 72 h incubation) to the assay plate and incubated for a further 16–20 h. Recombinant RSPO1 was used as a positive control, as well as pcDNA DEST40 (Invitrogen) expressing RSPO1, and a recombinant protein dose response was added to each plate to control for plate to plate variability; pcDNA DEST40 empty vector served as negative control. Steady Glo (Promega) was added to the assay plates and following a 5 min room temperature incubation, the assay was read on the Envision (Perkin Elmer) using a 0.1 s/well protocol for US luminescence giving a value of “relative light units” (RLU) for each test well.</p>

Gene expression was quantified using the RPKMforgenes.py method (settings -fulltranscript, -onlycoding)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> from which raw gene counts were obtained (version last modified 11.04.2013). Genes that could not be resolved (based on sequence similarity) and/or had 0 counts in at least one sample were removed from the analysis. Genes were annotated using the RefSeq database. A total of 11402 unique genes were represented in the RNAseq data. Non-normalized RNAseq data was used as input in anota2seq (ver. 1.2.0; with parameters datatype = “RNAseq”, normalize = TRUE, transformation = “TMM-log2”). Changes in translational efficiencies altering protein levels were assessed using the anota2seqAnalyze function. Contrasts were set to assess the effect of CR-31 in N organoids, the effect of CR-31 in KP organoids and the difference between non-treated N and KP organoids.

Current and past samples of Intestine Chips, Caco-2 Gut Chips and Caco-2 Transwells, as well as human intestinal tissues from GEO, were pre-processed with SCAN (SCAN.UPC package)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Resulting expression values were then quantile-normalized together, and differential analysis was performed with limma package for each comparison pair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>; gene expression values were averaged for each condition. Template matching was used to extract genes that are differentially expressed between these conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Gene lists for the selected GO terms were collected from the Gene Ontology Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://geneontology.org/">http://geneontology.org/</ext-link>). For each GO term, no more than 18 genes were selected to determine similarity between Intestine Chip and duodenum as well as differences compared to the other samples based on their z-score and template matching score [PMID 11597334], and a curated heatmap for these selected genes grouped by GO terms was generated by clustering the conditions according to the averaged gene expression values using Canberra distance and complete linkage. Gene expression data for primary human small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), Caco-2 Gut Chip, and Caco-2 Transwell were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> (accession no.

Transcriptome profiles of duodenal organoids and primary Intestine Chip performed in this study were deposited to the NCBI GEO database (accession no. GSE109471). Global gene expression profiles were visually represented using self-organizing maps generated using the Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector (GEDI) program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. In GEDI, each pixel tile within a mosaic represents a minicluster of genes that have highly similar expression patterns across all analyzed samples. The same genes are forced to the same mosaic position for all GEDI maps, hence allowing direct comparison of transcriptomes based on the overall mosaic pattern. The color of tiles indicates the centroid value of gene expression level for each minicluster.</p>

27653516	<italic>SLC26A9</italic> has 3 annotated human protein‐coding isoforms. Isoform 1 (ENST00000367135) codes a 791aa protein that terminates in a PDZ‐domain binding motif, which facilitates SLC26A9 interaction with CFTR. Isoforms 2 (ENST000000367134) and 3 (ENST00000340781) both code the same 887aa protein that lacks the PDZ‐binding motif. Comparative genomic analysis of <italic>SLC26A9</italic> predicts that isoform 1 is present in all species beyond <italic>Xenopus</italic>, whereas isoforms 2 and 3 are primate‐specific. Transcriptome analysis revealed that isoform 1 was the primary transcript in the lung, pancreas, salivary gland, skin and stomach (n=3 per tissue, Human Protein Atlas). Isoform 3 has lower expression, and was only found in lung and skin (4.5% and 43.5% of isoform 1, respectively). Isoform 2 was not identified in any of these tissues. RT‐PCR of <italic>SLC26A9</italic> RNA transcripts detected abundant isoform 1 in primary stomach, lung, and pancreas tissues, whereas isoforms that do not encode a PDZ‐binding motif (ie, isoforms 2 or 3) were only found in the lung. Isoform 2 has also been previously reported in primary lung cells (Bertrand CA, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015;50(S41):230).</p>

27653516	    <p>PB01 is a new orally inhaled therapeutic preparation of recombinant human follistatin 288 (rhFST288). Safety and toxicology studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys showed that single and multiple inhaled daily doses of PB01 (8‐400 μg/kg) over 14 days were well tolerated and there were no significant adverse effects on respiratory parameters, locomotor activity, or the cardiovascular system. In addition, there were no adverse changes in clinical pathology parameters and no tissue and organ pathology. Pharmacokinetic analysis of PB01 in serum indicated minimal systemic exposure after inhalation. A first‐in‐human Phase 1 clinical trial on the safety and pharmacokinetic effects of PB01 in healthy male participants has commenced (ACTRN12615000984594). Results from the single ascending dose study show that PB01 was well tolerated by the participants. There were no serious adverse events and all reported adverse events were considered mild. There was no dose‐limiting toxicity, and no clinically significant changes in laboratory assessments, vital signs, 12‐lead ECG, pulmonary function test and physical examination from baseline, for any PB01 treatment group. A multiple ascending dose study has completed with results expected by July 2016. A second Phase 1 clinical study to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of PB01 on lung inflammation is planned.</p>
27653516	<bold>Results:</bold> Seventy‐five MRSA strains from 34 patients (58.8% male, median age 13.4 years, range 2.57‐52.15 years) were analyzed. The mean MRSA colonization time was 1.57 years (1.24 SD). Fifteen (44.1%) of 34 patients harbored MRSA for less than one year (mean time 0.32 years ± 0.32 SD) and SCC<italic>mec</italic> type IV was detected in 12/15 (80%) patients. Nineteen (55.9%) of 34 patients harbored MRSA for more than one year (mean time 2.50 years ± 0.71 SD) and SCC<italic>mec</italic> type IV was detected in 5/19 (26.3%) patients (Fisher's exact test P= 0.006). MLST and SCC<italic>mec</italic> analysis indicated that 15 different clones were present in our cohort. Most of them (66%) belonged to known epidemic lineages (Table). Thirty‐two (94%) out of 34 patients were infected by a single MRSA clone. Most of the MRSA isolates were grouped into 3 lineages: ST5, ST228 and ST1866 (differing from ST5 by a single mutation in the <italic>pta</italic> allele). These clones were very closely related to each other (576 single nucleotide variations on average). The ST228 clone has been previously described as a Southern Germany epidemic clone. Whole genome analysis also showed that clones underwent genetic adaptation independently in each patient with several single nucleotide specific variants.</p>

27653516	    <p>We sequenced the genomes of 40 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clinical strains obtained from the Trentino Regional Support CF Centre (Italy) and isolated from the sputum of a single CF patient over an eight‐year period (2007‐2014). Genotypic analysis of the population by in silico MLST revealed a characteristic single clonal population dominated by ST390 and five closely related new ST variants indicating that all members of the population likely belong to the same clonal lineage and evolved from a common ancestor.</p>
27653516	    <p>We then focused our attention on a subgroup of five clonal isolates belonging to ST1864, one susceptible to antibiotics, two resistant to some antibiotics and two MDR. Not only did they share the same genetic background, but they presented the same phenotypic traits that play a key role in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> adaptation process and may be involved in phenotypic resistance. When the genomes were analysed through the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database to detect the presence of resistance genes, we did not found any differences between the five strains, neither for presence or absence of specific genes nor for significant mutations. This is consistent with the hypothesis that these MDR phenotypes arose from as yet uncharacterized genomic determinants.</p>
27653516	<bold>Results:</bold> Eleven (73%) were female. Age at colonization with <italic>Bc (cBc</italic>) was 17.5 (7‐44.9); follow‐up after <italic>cBc</italic> was 3.7 (1‐6.3) years. Nine (60%) were under care at the Pediatric CF Centre. Patients with <italic>Bc</italic> were segregated from all other CF patients. MLST identified four different clones: 3 had ST102; 4, ST482; 2, ST771; and 6, ST404; all evenly infecting children and adults. Best FEV<sub>1</sub>%Pred on the year prior to <italic>cBc</italic> was 86 (45‐125). Four each had chronic bronchial infection (cbi) with <italic>S. aureus</italic> (3 children) and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (all adults). Twelve (80%) were on nebulized colistin either for eradication therapy or cbi with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Ten (67%) including 5/6 adults had no change in their symptoms at <italic>cBc</italic> but five (three with ST404 and one each ST102 and ST482) had noted increased symptoms for weeks to months. Symptoms subsided in all following the start of long‐term nebulized ceftazidime 1g bid (Cft), and all 4 children had ≥10% absolute increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>%Pred within 2‐4 months. Five (4 adults) developed cbi with <italic>Bc</italic> over the first year after <italic>cBc</italic> and still had it in 2015. Eight (7 children) were <italic>Bc</italic>‐free in 2015 and two children had intermittent colonization. There was no significant difference in the annual change in the best FEV<sub>1</sub> over two years prior to <italic>cBC</italic> (‐0.2 (‐5.5 ‐ +8)) vs 2 years after (+2.7 (‐2.5 ‐ +15)). There was also no difference in the annual number of exacerbations requiring IV antibiotics: 0.3±0.5 vs 0.035±0.12. Remarkably the annual total number of exacerbations decreased: 1.75±1.99 vs 0.82±0.82 (p&lt;0.005). FEV<sub>1</sub> increased significantly within 4 months in the 13 patients being put on Cft : 90.2±27.5 vs 80.8±24.2 (p&lt;0.01).</p>

To identify peaks of more diffuse histone modification signals over larger regions, we applied the SICER algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053270-Zang1">[84]</xref> to the genome-wide raw sequence reads of H3K4me2 occupation sites in the lactating mammary gland, in virgin MECs, and in liver. Input–seq read libraries were used as a control in both analyses. SICER's default parameters were used except for the change of species to mm9 and the gap size. The window size was kept at 200 bp because this is approximately the length of a nucleosome plus linker. The gap size parameter is a multiple of the window size, but the optimal choice of this parameter depends on the characteristics of the chromatin modification. To determine an appropriate gap size, SICER was iteratively run with increasing gap size and the aggregate island score was plotted as a function of gap multiple to find the gap size for which the maximum is reached. An optimal gap size of twice the window size (gap size = 400 bp) in lactating mammary was chosen and this gap size choice appears to be robust to tissue type (mammary or liver) or the control library. The same procedure was repeated for K4Me2 in virgin MECs, yielding a gap size of three times the window size (gap size = 600 bp).</p>

25751518	        <p>We showed that expanded epithelial cells from SI and LI are enriched for intestinal stem cells as evidenced by their dependence on R-Spondin 2, their expression of stem cell markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and their high colony-forming frequency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0118792.t001">Table 1</xref>). We then used gene array analysis to determine if cells expanded from SI and LI demonstrated differences in their molecular signatures (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE56525). Among the 21,238 total probes on each array, 3274 probes were significantly different. After removal of probes for the same gene, 1118 transcripts had an expression fold change greater than 1.5. Cells expanded from SI and LI clustered separately using unsupervised hierarchical clustering methods where the distances are defined linearly (left axis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Therefore, even though we were unable to distinguish subregions in SI tissue (ileum, jejunum, etc.), we did not detect any major differences or heterogeneity among the many SI samples examined. In addition, while our samples ranged in age from 20–23 weeks, this variable was deemed non-essential due to proper clustering of gene expression among the SI and LI samples.</p>

29110754	        <p>Previous work has demonstrated that stem-cell-derived human intestinal organoids resemble immature human duodenum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Finkbeiner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, transplantation into immunocompromised mice results in HIO maturation to an adult-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Finkbeiner et al., 2015</xref>). These analyses compared HIOs consisting of epithelium and mesenchyme to whole-thickness human intestinal tissue, which also possessed cellular constituents lacking in HIOs such as neurons, blood vessels and immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Finkbeiner et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the extent to which the HIO epithelium resembles immature/fetal intestinal epithelium remained unclear. To address this gap and further characterize the HIO epithelium relative to fetal and adult duodenal epithelium, we isolated and cultured epithelium from HIOs grown entirely in vitro, from fetal duodenum, adult duodenum, or HIOs that had been transplanted into the kidney capsule of NSG immuno-deficient mice and matured for 10 weeks. These epithelium-only derived organoids were expanded in vitro in uniform tissue culture conditions for 4–5 passages and processed for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Comparison of global transcriptomes between all samples in addition to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) used to generate HIOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Finkbeiner et al., 2015</xref>; E-MTAB-3158) revealed a clear hierarchy in which both in vitro grown HIO epithelium (p=5.06 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) and transplanted epithelium (p=7.79 × 10<sup>-14</sup>) shares a substantially greater degree of similarity to fetal small intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p>
29110754	        <p>RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit and following the 'Total RNA’ isolation protocol (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA). RNA library preparation and RNA-sequencing (single-end, 50 bp read length) were performed by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core using the Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 platform. All sequences were deposited in the EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress database (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns1:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004473">SCR_004473</ext-link>) using Annotare 2.0 and are cataloged under the accession number E-MTAB-5801. Transcriptional quantitation analysis was conducted using 64-bit Debian Linux stable version 7.10 ('Wheezy’). Pseudoalignment of RNA-seq data was computed using kallisto v0.43.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) and differential expression of pseudoaligned sequences was calculated using the R package DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Love et al., 2014</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns1:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000154">SCR_000154</ext-link>).</p>

29110754	      <p>We included control HIOs injected with PBS and treated with SC-514 in our initial experiment and uploaded the relevant RNA-seq data to the public repository at EMBL (E-MTAB-5801), however we did not address this dimension of the experiment in our original manuscript out of concerns that it might over-complicate the presentation of our analysis. However, in response to concerns from the reviewers, we have added supplemental figures, which we hope will clarify the baseline effects of the NF-κB inhibitor SC-514. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> shows the log2-transformed fold-change in gene expression relative to PBS-injected controls for all 7 experimental conditions examined in this set of experiments: live <italic>E. coli</italic> +/- SC-514, heatkilled <italic>E. coli</italic> +/- SC-514, and hypoxic culture +/- SC-514, and PBS + SC-514. This figure shows that the number of genes altered by treatment with SC-514 alone is comparable to the set of genes altered in other experimental conditions, although there are generally more genes that are down-regulated by SC-514 exposure than there are genes that are upregulated by SC-514. We examined over-represented genes sets from the GO, KEGG, and REACTOME databases in genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated by treatment with SC-514 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>) in order to better understand the types of processes that might be influenced by SC-514 exposure. We plotted the pathways that were in the top 90 percentile based on statistical significance, indicating a high degree of enrichment in the gene subsets regulated by NF-κB inhibitor SC-514 at baseline. The data indicates that SC-514 may suppress some aspects of transcription and translation and may up-regulate authophagy and translation-associated processes. Notably, SC-514 does not appear to have a strong effect at baseline on the pathways identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> as key NFkB-dependent responses to bacterial contact and/or hypoxia, namely innate and adaptive defense, epithelial barrier integrity, angiogenesis and hypoxia signaling, or intestinal development.</p>

To facilitate a degree of comparability between microarray expression intensities and single cell clusters, quantile normalization, as implemented in R package ‘preprocessCore’ was performed.

29596476	        <p>Our studies indicate a clear role for the differentiation state of the epithelium in mediating cytokine and chemokine expression and innate immune recruitment in murine colitis. Nevertheless, the stage at which the epithelial cells were arrested remained unclear. In order to address this, we performed microarray analysis on 4 control and 6 inflamed colons (GEO accession GSE87317). Analysis of individual markers for different cell types suggested that there was a pronounced decrease of goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells and a moderate decrease of enterocytes and stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), cellular phenotypes that we have confirmed by histologic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002417.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Because transit amplifying cells (TACs) are defined functionally, the existing monovariate markers are not sufficient to assess their enrichment. In order to determine whether there was a relative increase in TACs in inflamed colon, we employed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using published gene sets derived from epithelium enriched for various cell types. A stem cell gene set was derived from sorted Lgr5+ epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref014">14</xref>], while enterocyte and secretory progenitor gene sets were derived from various pharmacologic and genetic treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref015">15</xref>]. Finally, a TAC signature was derived from regenerative epithelium composed of 97% TACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002417.ref016">16</xref>]. Using GSEA, we found de-enrichment for gene sets associated with secretory cells, enterocytes, and stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). Conversely, we saw enrichment for genes associated with Atoh1 knockout (which lacks goblet cells) and the TAC signature. Importantly, several of the genes found in the TAC signature are chemokines, all of which were strongly induced transcriptionally in our microarray data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002417.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). By contrast, there were no cytokines or chemokines present in any of the gene sets for stem or differentiated cell types. This observation confirms that cytokine expression is present within the epithelium itself and that this is enhanced in TACs, but not in stem cells or differentiated cells. Together, these analyses suggest that the suppressed differentiation and enhanced proliferation that is seen in colitis is the result of expansion of the TAC compartment and not the result of stem cell expansion.</p>

In particular, ductal extension and branching during puberty and epithelial expansion of alveolar milk-forming units within pregnancy require distinct morphological movements and coordinated efforts of multiple epithelial constituents within basal and luminal compartments of the bilayered mammary tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macias and Hinck, 2012</xref>). Epithelial lineages are derived from a hierarchical network of stem, progenitor, and more differentiated progeny.

Bulb-shaped terminal end buds (TEBs) drive development during puberty, where an outer layer of stem-like cap cells and an inner layer of body cells lay the foundation for the epithelial constituents that make up the ductal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smalley and Ashworth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for orchestrating self-renewal cues required for stem cell maintenance and cell fate decisions in multiple embryonic and postnatal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zeng and Nusse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Amerongen et al., 2012a</xref>). The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is required at the earliest stage of mammary development in the embryo for the specification of the mammary placode and initiation of mammary morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2004</xref>) and in postnatal development for proper stem cell maintenance, branching morphogenesis, and alveolar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatsell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lindvall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badders et al., 2009</xref>). Pathway activation occurs through the binding of a Wnt ligand to a receptor complex composed of Frizzled (Fzd) and a coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6). This Wnt–receptor combination prompts the disassociation of a complex composed of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), casein kinase 1α (CK1α), Axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), resulting in stabilization of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angers and Moon, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The Wnt/β-catenin–independent pathway embodies alternative Wnt signaling mechanisms that do not stabilize β-catenin or engage the coreceptors LRP5/6. Rather, these outcomes control various processes such as planar cell polarity, convergent extension, calcium fluxes, and actin/cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angers and Moon, 2009</xref>). Relative to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the molecular determinants of Wnt/β-catenin–independent pathways are less characterized; however, proteins implicated in Wnt/β-catenin–independent pathways include the Rho and Rac GTPases, Rho-Kinase (ROCK), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the calcium-sensitive enzymes PKC and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CAMKII; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Amerongen et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angers and Moon, 2009</xref>). Implicit in conveying the specificity of Wnt signaling transduction, the Wnt receptor repertoire likely plays an instrumental role in assimilating multiple concurrent Wnt inputs within a developmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Amerongen and Nusse, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Alternative receptors of the Ror and Ryk receptor tyrosine kinase families are mediators of Wnt/β-catenin–independent signaling together with Fzd receptors. Ror1 and Ror2 display both overlapping and distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns in the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsuda et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, Wnt5a and Ror2 exhibit overlapping spatiotemporal expression in multiple embryonic structures, and strong phenotypic similarities exist between mice deficient in Ror2 and Wnt5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeChiara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takeuchi et al., 2000</xref>). Multiple models have since established that Ror2 mediates Wnt5a signaling, and under certain contexts, results in the antagonism of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mikels and Nusse, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Amerongen et al., 2012b</xref>). Although functions for the Wnt5a/Ror axis have been established based on phenotypic defects in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, and vertebrates, exactly how multiple cell types within a given tissue convey specific Wnt signals to coordinate a particular developmental process remains unknown. In the mammary gland, the existence of multiple Wnt ligands has been realized for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavin and McMahon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bühler et al., 1993</xref>); however, the contribution of the receptor to Wnt signaling specificity and function in vivo remains undefined.</p><p>We therefore interrogated the developmental outcome of Ror2 loss in the postnatal mammary gland by lentiviral-mediated shRNA silencing. Using this approach, we observed that disruption of Ror2 in vivo affects branching and differentiation of the mammary epithelium. Gene expression profiling of sorted epithelial fractions revealed distinct alterations within luminal and basal epithelial compartments in Ror2-deficient mammary outgrowths. Notably, dramatic changes in actin cytoskeletal genes affecting mammary developmental outcome were detected. We also examined the integration of Wnt/β-catenin–dependent and –independent signaling machinery as it relates to the epithelial hierarchy and coordination of tissue morphogenesis. Collectively, this study uncovers an intricate model of Wnt pathway coordination in vivo and assigns an important role for the alternative Wnt receptor Ror2 in directing branching morphogenesis, differentiation, and actin-cytoskeletal cues within the mammary epithelium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ligands and receptors of the Wnt/β-catenin–independent pathway exhibit temporal and spatial regulation in the mammary gland</title><p>Discovery of the expression of multiple Wnt ligands in the mammary gland suggested the necessity for these proteins in the regulation of mammary gland development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavin and McMahon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bühler et al., 1993</xref>). To gain a better understanding of the specificity of Wnt signaling in the context of mammary development, we sought to identify the spatiotemporal expression patterns of Wnt ligand and receptor components within the mammary epithelium.

Expression patterns of Wnts and their associated receptors were subsequently assessed in more refined epithelial subpopulations. Studies have demonstrated the ability to segregate the luminal CD24<sup>+</sup>CD29<sup>lo</sup> fraction into mature luminal (ML; c-kit<sup>−</sup>CD14<sup>−</sup>), luminal progenitor (LP; c-kit<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>), and alveolar progenitor (AP; c-kit<sup>−/lo</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>) subpopulations based on the expression of c-kit and CD14b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asselin-Labat et al., 2011</xref>).

Intriguingly, when expression patterns of <italic>Wnt5a/Ror2</italic> and <italic>Wnt5b/Ror1</italic> were evaluated within the luminal fractions, they exhibited similar expression trends, with <italic>Wnt5a/Ror2</italic> present in ML and LP cell subpopulations and <italic>Wnt5b/Ror1</italic> present in LP and AP subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1, D and E</xref>).

These observations suggest a yet-undefined role for β-catenin–independent Wnt signaling in mammary epithelial homeostasis and offer insight into the potential Wnt ligand/receptor pairings exhibited in the mammary epithelium.</p></sec><sec><title>Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity and Ror2 expression are inversely correlated in the mammary gland</title><p>Studies of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in mammary development have demonstrated its involvement in guiding self-renewal cues and decisions of lineage potential in the mammary epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zeng and Nusse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Amerongen et al., 2012a</xref>). Additional reports have shown that Wnt/β-catenin–independent signaling can antagonize the Wnt/β-catenin–dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mikels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2014</xref>), yet it remains unclear how these pathways cooperate in vivo where multiple cell types exist under different developmental contexts. We sought to identify the spatial distribution and relationship between Wnt pathways in vivo by probing the location of Wnt/β-catenin activity relative to Ror2 expression in the mammary gland. To analyze Wnt/β-catenin signaling in situ, we used a lentiviral reporter harboring 7TCF/Lef binding sites upstream of <italic>eGFP</italic> (7TCF-<italic>eGFP</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuerer and Nusse, 2010</xref>) to transduce primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and subsequently evaluate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vivo after transplantation. This reporter reliably identifies Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in primary MECs in response to both Wnt stimulation and inhibition (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp2" ns0:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201408058/DC1">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>). Significant enrichment of Wnt/β-catenin activity was observed in the TEBs of the developing gland, distinctly localized to the stem-like cap cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A–C</xref>). This activity diminished down the tapered neck of the TEB, where cells differentiate into mature myoepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). An SH2-containing inositol 5′-phosphate (<italic>s-SHIP</italic>; isoform of SH2-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase) promoter controlling <italic>eGFP</italic> expression, previously shown to mark cap cells of the TEB during puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai and Rohrschneider, 2010</xref>), mirrored the expression gradient and localization of Wnt/β-catenin activity in the TEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>).

When the pattern of the alternative receptor Ror2 was examined in the TEB structure, expression was inversely correlated with the location of Wnt/β-catenin activity. Specifically, Ror2 expression was weak in the cap cell layer and gradually more prominent as the cell layers differentiate into mature epithelial layers of the trailing TEB neck and duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Within the trailing epithelial network, Ror2 was evident in both basal and luminal epithelial layers of the pubertal gland, and this pattern of expression was maintained in the adult virgin ductal network (Fig. S2, C and D).</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity and Ror2 expression are inversely correlated in the mammary gland.</bold> (A) Fluorescent whole mount of a 4-wk mammary outgrowth harboring a lentiviral 7TCF-<italic>eGFP</italic> reporter to survey Wnt activity in vivo.

Collectively, these data uncover, for the first time in vivo, the inverse relationship of Ror2 expression with Wnt/β-catenin and s-SHIP activity, distinguishing the formation of mature (Ror2-expressing) myoepithelial cells from more primitive (Wnt/β-catenin active) stem cell populations as the mammary gland builds its bilayered epithelial network during puberty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Wnt/β-catenin–dependent and –independent pathways are integrated in the mammary epithelium</title><p>The inverse correlation of Wnt/β-catenin activity with Ror2 expression observed in vivo suggests two conceivable scenarios for how Wnt pathways cooperate in mammary development: (1) Ror2 functions to restrict the localization and intensity of Wnt/β-catenin action by pathway antagonism or (2) distinct Wnt pathways demarcate the differentiation states of the mammary epithelial hierarchy during active morphogenesis. Nevertheless, the assimilation of multiple Wnt inputs in vivo is likely dictated by cell-surface expression of specific Wnt receptors within distinct epithelial populations together with the Wnt ligand combination present within the niche. In light of findings that <italic>Wnt5a</italic> and <italic>Wnt5b</italic> expression patterns were distinct within mammary epithelial subpopulations, the signaling capacities of these Wnts were further interrogated in the mammary epithelium. In an effort to establish which Wnt ligands activate Wnt/β-catenin–dependent versus –independent pathways in MECs, we used an in vitro system of primary MEC monolayer cultures, treating cells with a prototypical Wnt/β-catenin ligand, Wnt3a, alone and in combination with Wnt/β-catenin–independent ligands, Wnt5a and Wnt5b, to assess the interaction of these proteins in the mammary epithelium. The 7TCF-<italic>mCherry</italic> reporter was used as a readout for Wnt/β-catenin–dependent activity. After 24 h, we observed an increase in mCherry-positive cells in response to Wnt3a, whereas Wnt5a and Wnt5b were unable to activate 7TCF-<italic>mCherry</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Both Wnt5a and Wnt5b did, however, inhibit the induction of 7TCF-mCherry–positive cells in response to Wnt3a, demonstrating the capacity of both Wnt5a and Wnt5b to antagonize Wnt/β-catenin activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Additionally, qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>Axin2</italic>, a downstream-negative feedback regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, was used to corroborate the reporter data. After 8 h of Wnt3a treatment, robust <italic>Axin2</italic> mRNA induction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Wnt5a and Wnt5b significantly inhibited Wnt3a-induced <italic>Axin2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The antagonism of Wnt5a and Wnt5b was not a result of receptor competition with Wnt3a, because the phosphorylation of Lrp6 by Wnt3a was equivalently activated in the presence of Wnt5a or Wnt5b (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp3" ns0:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201408058/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). Lentiviral shRNA silencing of <italic>Ror2</italic> abrogated these effects and demonstrated that Ror2 was required to mediate both Wnt5a and Wnt5b inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in primary MECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of Ror2 in vitro potentiated the ability of Wnt5a, but not Wnt5b, to antagonize Wnt/β-catenin induction in response to Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3 E</xref> and S3 C). This is likely a consequence of sustained Ror2 expression and Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling, as Wnt5a stimulation typically prompts the down-regulation of Ror2 expression in primary MECs (Fig. S3 B). These data not only highlight the integration of Wnt/β-catenin–dependent and –independent pathways in primary MECs, but also reveal an intricate role for Ror2 in conveying Wnt/β-catenin–independent signals elicited by Wnt5a and Wnt5b, offering insight into the coordination of multiple Wnt inputs in vivo.</p><fig id="fig3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Wnt/β-catenin–dependent and –independent pathways are integrated in the mammary epithelium.</bold> (A) FACS profiles of primary MECs representing the percentage of 7TCF-mCherry induction after treatment with Wnt3a, Wnt5a, and Wnt5b.

Expression of essential mediators of this pathway was investigated at the onset of branching in shLUC versus shRor2 organoids, including cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), Ras homology family member A (RhoA), and RAC1.

We next evaluated the in vivo phosphorylation status of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of actin-binding proteins. ERM proteins act downstream of Rho GTPases and have been previously implicated in regulating actin cytoskeleton rearrangements during morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivetic and Ridley, 2004</xref>). Phosphorylated ERM normally localizes to the apicolateral surface of luminal cells of mammary ducts, as was observed in the ducts of shLUC outgrowths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 G</xref>).

First, we established an intricate landscape of Wnt/β-catenin–independent ligand and receptor expression within epithelial subsets of the mammary gland. Moreover, we established the ability of Wnt5a and Wnt5b to antagonize the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in vitro through Ror2 in primary MECs, and discovered the intricate spatial organization exhibited in vivo between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Tcf/lef activity) and the Wnt/β-catenin–independent pathway (Ror2 expression). Functional studies revealed a requirement for the Ror2 receptor in orchestrating proper branching morphogenesis and differentiation of the mammary epithelium. These alterations were accompanied by changes in both the luminal and basal epithelium when Ror2 signaling was interrupted. In particular, expression profiling of RNA isolated from luminal and basal epithelial cells from control and shRor2 outgrowths uncovered alterations in genes associated with developmental processes, cell–cell communication, differentiation, actin cytoskeleton organization, and cell adhesion. Lastly, we demonstrated that Ror2 mediates appropriate actin cytoskeletal dynamics during branch formation and provided evidence for the Rho pathway mediating this effect downstream of Ror2.</p><p>The expression of multiple Wnt ligands across different stages of mammary development provided early evidence for the involvement of Wnt signaling in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavin and McMahon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bühler et al., 1993</xref>). Subsequent studies extended these observations using in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kouros-Mehr and Werb, 2006</xref>), and, more recently, microarray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kendrick et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim et al., 2010</xref>) and proteomic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ji et al., 2011</xref>) analyses of sorted epithelial cell fractions. Functional roles for particular Wnt ligands have been previously identified, such as Wnt4 acting downstream of progesterone receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brisken et al., 2000</xref>) and Wnt5a downstream of TGF-β signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roarty and Serra, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pavlovich et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, Wnt5a and Wnt5b were established as substrates of MMP3, and Wnt5b was implicated as a negative regulator of mammary stem cell dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kessenbrock et al., 2013</xref>). At present, it remains unclear how the mammary gland assimilates multiple, simultaneous Wnt inputs during development. Recent studies suggest that even a single Wnt protein can elicit diverse signaling activities in vivo depending on the cellular context and combination of receptors present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Amerongen et al., 2012b</xref>). The current study provides significant refinement of the expression patterns of multiple Wnt ligands and receptors in vivo. We identified an intricate pattern of expression shared between <italic>Wnt5a/Ror2</italic> and <italic>Wnt5b/Ror1</italic> within the luminal compartment, which indicates that these Wnt/β-catenin–independent arms of signaling are functioning distinctly in mature versus progenitor subpopulations. Similar trends in ligand/receptor pairs were also observed across developmental stages, highlighting the distinction between <italic>Wnt5a/Ror2</italic> and <italic>Wnt5b/Ror1</italic> signaling in vivo. These findings substantially extend our understanding of the specificity and nonredundant nature of Wnt signaling components within the complex epithelial lineages of the mammary gland. Studies of Wnt5a and Wnt5b function in chondrocytes of the long bones also suggest a distinction among these Wnts in other developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The cap cell layer of the TEB represents a mammary stem cell reservoir that drives the formation of more mature epithelial lineages of the epithelial bilayer during ductal extension and primary branch formation within puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Williams and Daniel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>). We established that the cap cells of the TEB represent an active zone for Wnt/β-catenin activity, and discovered that this activity is inversely correlated with the expression of Ror2, which increases in abundance down the neck of the TEB. We propose a model where Wnt/β-catenin activity provides self-renewal cues for cap/stem cell functionality within the TEB, with Ror2 expression delineating the transition zone where cap and body cells differentiate into more mature epithelial lineages along the basal and luminal hierarchy down the trailing ducts. Within the luminal compartment, Ror2 regulated the composition of ML, AP, and LP populations, where the absence of Ror2 skewed the AP-to-LP pool, altering the differentiation capacity of the mammary epithelium. Within the basal compartment, Ror2 guided the establishment of lineage potential down a more differentiated state. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in expression of genes associated with mesenchymal differentiation (<italic>Trp63</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Foxc1</italic>, and <italic>Gja1</italic>) in shRor2 basal cell fractions by microarray profiling. Additionally, <italic>Procr</italic>, a newly identified multipotent mammary stem cell marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), was elevated in the microarray within shRor2 basal fractions, which suggests that progression of a basal stem/progenitor cell to a more differentiated myoepithelial cell requires Ror2 signaling. These data further suggest a scenario where the Wnt receptor dictates, at least in part, the developmental outcome of the mammary epithelium. Wnt signal specificity and heterogeneity within the mammary gland are likely not determined solely by the receptor context, given that multiple Wnt ligands, receptors, coreceptors, and downstream signaling players exist. Local Wnts that supply spatial cues to orient the plane of division and determine cell fate within the TEB could potentially represent another aspect of guidance provided by Wnt signaling during active morphogenesis and lineage commitment, as has been demonstrated with embryonic stem cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Habib et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, signaling gradients specified by individual Wnt ligands, or other extracellular Wnt modulators, could provide an additional level of Wnt signaling refinement during mammary development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiecker and Niehrs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harterink et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Reciprocal relationships between Wnt/β-catenin–dependent and –independent signaling, with regard to self-renewal and differentiation processes, have been observed in other models of development, regeneration, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Green et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Florian et al., 2013</xref>). In some cellular contexts, Wnt/β-catenin–dependent pathway antagonism by Wnt/β-catenin–independent mechanisms exist in several cell types and within certain tissues, mediated predominantly by Wnt5a. Multiple studies have demonstrated that this antagonism is elicited through the tyrosine kinase activity of Ror2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mikels and Nusse, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mikels et al., 2009</xref>), although other mechanisms have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>). In our studies, both Wnt5a and Wnt5b antagonized Wnt/β-catenin–dependent activity in primary MECs, whereas disruption of Ror2 expression in vitro abrogated these effects. Ror2 overexpression, however, potentiated the antagonism of Wnt/β-catenin activity in MECs; however, this effect was specific only for Wnt5a. These data suggest that the mechanism of inhibition by Wnt5b likely does not depend on Ror2 abundance, but on that of another receptor, perhaps Ror1. Given that Lrp6 activation was maintained in Wnt3a-treated cultures with either Wnt5a or Wnt5b, the mechanism of antagonism is likely a result of downstream signaling elicited by Wnt/β-catenin–independent signaling, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CamKII→PKC→NFAT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angers and Moon, 2009</xref>). The decrease in abundance of the 7TCF-<italic>eGFP</italic> reporter in vivo in response to Ror2 depletion was surprising based on our in vitro data. We propose two explanations for these observations. First, Ror2 loss prompted the down-regulation of genes associated with mesenchymal differentiation, which could alter integrity of the bulk basal/myoepithelial cell population, and thus indirectly affect Wnt/β-catenin–responsive stem cells. No differences in primary or secondary mammosphere formation between basal FACS-sorted cells from shLUC and shRor2 outgrowths were observed, which suggests that myoepithelial differentiation rather than self-renewal was compromised. Second, in vitro assays involve a defined interaction of multiple Wnts and short-term responses that are not necessarily reflected in vivo, where multiple Wnt pathway modulators and additional Wnt ligand and receptor interactions between multiple cell types are likely occurring. For instance, Ror2 interactions with Fzd have been demonstrated in other cellular contexts, distinguishing Wnt/β-catenin–dependent versus –independent signaling decisions when Fzd couples to either Ror2 or Lrp5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishita et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Ror homologue, Cam-1, exhibits a non–cell-autonomous mechanism of Wnt pathway antagonism by means of sequestering Wnts and fine-tuning the pattern of Wnt pathway activity and cellular fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Green et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, the potential for Wnt gradient influences on specifying the Wnt signaling output, together with the possibility of unique Wnt–Wnt interactions in vivo, presents another layer of complexity that needs to be explored further in the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nalesso et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, our results highlight the intricacy of Wnt pathway components in vivo and the potential of Ror2 to engage additional Wnt ligands, receptor interactions, and other modulators of the pathway.</p><p>How cells actively collaborate and communicate during the shaping of an organized epithelial structure such as the mammary gland remains an evolving puzzle. Alternative Wnt/β-catenin–independent pathways are instrumental in guiding embryonic development by providing the instructive cues essential for tissue morphogenesis and by dictating appropriate cellular movements in concert with proper orientation of cells within a particular plane of a tissue. Roles for Wnt/β-catenin–independent signaling in planar cell polarity and convergent extension movements, spanning <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, zebrafish, and mammalian models, highlight their critical function in directing morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Amerongen, 2012</xref>). For instance, in the developing mouse embryo, Wnt/β-catenin–independent pathways serve an essential function in coordinating development of several organs, including the skeleton, heart, and nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeChiara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takeuchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ho et al., 2012</xref>). In the mammary gland, branching morphogenesis is a key developmental process required for proper patterning of the epithelium, yet the regulatory mechanisms guiding appropriate tissue architecture are still incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorevski and Nelson, 2011</xref>). Elegant in vitro models have helped define the cellular cooperation that takes place during branching morphogenesis of the mammary epithelium, as well as some of the factors that govern these processes. One such pathway implicated in proper epithelial morphogenesis during branching is the Rho pathway, responsible for coordinating the collective movement of epithelial cells. Essential components of this pathway, including CDC42, Rho, Rac1, and ROCK, have been implicated in mediating appropriate branch formation during active epithelial morphogenesis, specifically coordinating both branch initiation and extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ewald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu and Nelson, 2013</xref>). Our discovery that protein expression levels of multiple Rho pathway components were altered in Ror2-depleted organoids during active branching morphogenesis in 3D cultures demonstrates the imbalance of Rho signaling imparted by Ror2 depletion. The net biological effect of these signaling alterations in the mammary epithelium was inappropriate branching morphogenesis, accompanied by mislocalized intercellular F-actin within shRor2 branches in vitro and improper positioning of phosphorylated ERM within the epithelial bilayer of shRor2 ducts in vivo. The current study, therefore, assigns the Wnt/β-catenin–independent receptor Ror2 as an important regulator of proper branching through the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics during epithelial morphogenesis. Intriguingly, given the inverse relationship of Ror2 expression with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in more mature versus primitive epithelial populations within the mammary gland, the establishment of lineage commitment down a more differentiated path could be related to actin cytoskeletal cues mediating cell fate decisions, as has been observed in epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connelly et al., 2010</xref>). The precise mechanisms downstream of Ror2 that signal to regulate the Rho pathway remain to be elucidated.</p><p>This study establishes the coordinated regulation of Wnt/β-catenin–dependent and –independent pathways in the context of postnatal mammary gland development and assigns a role for Ror2 in the regulation of proper branching and differentiation in vivo. In-depth characterization of Wnt signaling interactions in mammary development is a necessary prerequisite for understanding the cooperation of Wnt signaling pathways in heterogeneous cell populations within breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cleary et al., 2014</xref>). Given the association of the Wnt/β-catenin–dependent pathway with basal-like breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DiMeo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khramtsov et al., 2010</xref>), further characterization of Wnt specificity and Wnt pathway integration in the context of tumorigenesis is warranted. Future studies should yield significant insight into the role of Wnt-β-catenin–dependent and –independent signaling in the regulation of tumor heterogeneity and cellular interactions during cancer progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mouse strains and maintenance</title><p>This study was performed in accordance with the rules of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The third, fourth, and fifth mammary glands were harvested from virgin or pregnant stages of development. In the case of transplants, the fourth pair was used. Glands were subsequently weighed and manually minced into 1 mm × 1 mm fragments between two scalpels. Mammary organoids were derived by digesting the glands in DMEM/F12 containing 1 mg/ml Collagenase A (Roche) for 2 h at 37°C with constant rotation at 125 rpm. The digest was subjected to differential centrifugation to enrich for organoids by performing a series of short centrifugation steps (8 s at 1,500 rpm, performed three to four times). The enriched epithelial organoid preparation was subjected to 0.25% trypsin at 37°C for 5 min, washed, and filtered through a 0.40-µm cell strainer to obtain single MECs. Single cells were washed twice with PBS before transduction, RNA isolation, or FACS staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Lentiviral transduction of primary MECs</title><p>Transduction of primary MECs was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Welm et al., 2008</xref>), with modifications.

Single cell preparations were resuspended at a concentration of 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in HBSS<sup>+</sup> (containing 2% FBS with 10 mM Hepes buffer) for antibody staining. All antibody incubations were performed on ice for 30 min. Cells were stained with anti–mouse CD24-Pacific Blue (1:100; BioLegend) and anti–mouse CD29-APC (1:100; BioLegend) to separate the luminal and basal epithelial fractions. LP fractions were isolated by segregating the luminal CD24<sup>+</sup>CD29<sup>lo</sup> fraction based on either (1) CD61 or (2) the combination of CD14 and c-kit, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shore et al., 2012</xref>).

Compound (Tissue-Tek: Sakura Finetek Japan, Tokyo, Japan), frozen, and sectioned at 5 μm thickness. Sections were directly observed with a fluorescent microscope or subjected to immunofluorescent staining with an antibody against GFP (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used as the secondary antibody. Counterstaining was performed with Hoechst33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To stain secretory granules in Paneth cells and goblet cells, we used Rhodamine-labeled Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin I (UEA I) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). For immunofluorescent staining of GFP, antigen retrieval was performed by boiling samples for 30 min in Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 1 mM EDTA.</p>
27589228	        <p>To examine the clinical relevance of our findings, gene expression analysis was performed with intestinal epithelial cells obtained from surgical specimens of four Japanese FAP patients. We compared gene expression patterns in samples collected from adenomas sized from 5 to 10 mm, mucosae within 5 mm from the stalks of adenomas, and mucosae at least 20 mm distant from adenomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162300.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The results showed that, in comparison to the mucosae apart from adenomas, 488 genes were upregulated by more than 1.5-fold and 381 genes were downregulated by more than 1.5-fold in the adenomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162300.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Notably, the expression levels of <italic>LGR5</italic> in adenoma samples were significantly higher than those in normal mucosae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162300.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), suggesting that adenoma cells were successfully separated from normal cells. The genes upregulated and downregulated in FAP adenomas significantly overlapped with those in FP<sup>lo</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162300.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). We also analyzed previously published datasets of human sporadic adenomas [GSE8671 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0162300.ref047">47</xref>]], and found that the 1,774 genes upregulated (&gt; 1.5-fold) and 584 genes downregulated (&lt; -1.5-fold) in human sporadic adenomas also significantly overlapped with those in FP<sup>lo</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162300.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). These results suggest that the aging-associated gene expression signatures identified in FP<sup>lo</sup> cells are characteristics common to human FAP and sporadic adenomas. Notably, we identified 42 genes commonly upregulated in FP<sup>lo</sup> crypts, human FAP adenomas and human sporadic adenomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162300.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162300.s012">S2 Table</xref>). Similarly, 18 genes commonly downregulated were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162300.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162300.s013">S3 Table</xref>). About half of the identified upregulated genes (24/42 genes) have been shown to play a role in tumor development and progression (e.g. <italic>Cd44</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, etc.) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162300.s012">S2 Table</xref>). As for these 42 upregulated genes and 18 downregulated genes, qRT-PCR was performed with RNA samples obtained from the adenomas and the mucosae adjacent to and apart from adenomas. We found that the expression levels of the 42 upregulated genes were often increased in the mucosae adjacent to the adenomas as well as adenoma themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162300.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Indeed, when we scored the samples based on the average expression profiles of the 42 upregulated genes or 5 housekeeping genes, the score of the 42 genes, but not that of housekeeping genes, were elevated in normal mucosae adjacent to adenomas, as well as adenoma themselves, compared with normal mucosae apart from adenomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162300.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This suggests that, in human patients, the normal epithelial cells adjacent to adenomas have already acquired some traits of human adenoma, as in the case of mouse FP<sup>lo</sup> cells. However, in the same samples, expression of the 18 commonly downregulated genes was not decreased significantly in the mucosae adjacent to the adenomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162300.g005">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162300.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This might be due to the fact that human samples collected from the normal mucosae adjacent to adenomas include heterogeneous cell populations. Thus, the decreases in the expression levels of the 18 genes in the population corresponding to FP<sup>lo</sup> cells might be concealed by the expression signals from other populations. We think that this is also the reason why we could not detect any changes in global gene expression patterns between the normal mucosae adjacent to and apart from adenomas in our microarray analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162300.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>
28072391	        <p>To address the cooperative effects of CDX2 and BRAF function in regulating gene expression in human CRCs, we first compared our mouse gene signature to 212 human CRC samples available in TCGA project data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/">https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>) and that also have mutation data.

Then, we computed the intersection of this selection to the similar selection we had performed in our mouse data to ask for significant Cdx2 by Braf interactions. We observed strong association between our mouse data and human CRC data with significant enrichment of genes found ‘up’ in both data-sets as well as ‘down’ in both data-sets, and few disagreements between both data-sets (p=4.5×10<sup>−49</sup>, Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test of association) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>).

Three mice per group were used. Total RNA was extracted and purified from tumors or normal tissues at the colon-cecum junction. We used Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), which hold 41345 probe-sets, but we largely analyzed just those 25216 probe-sets that were mapped to Entrez gene IDs. Raw data was processed with the Robust Multi-array Average algorithm (RMA). Data is log2-transformed transcript abundance estimates. We fit a one-way ANOVA model to the five groups of samples. We supply a supplementary excel workbook that holds the same data as the series matrix file, but also holds the probe-set annotation at the time we analyzed the data, and some simple statistical calculations, which selects subsets of the probe-sets as differentially expressed between pairs of groups, as well as significant <italic>Cdx2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> interactions. It also gives the homologous human gene IDs we used for enrichment testing, which were 1-to-1 best homologs according to build 68 of NCBI's Homologene.

31015422	        <p id="Par31">JAR (human placenta choriocarcinoma) cells were transfected with the mammalian expression plasmid Peak12 driving the expression of GST, GST-WDD (320–607) or GST-WDD (231–607) open reading frames. THP-1 (human monocytic) cells were retrovirally transduced with the same constructs cloned into the P12-MMP retroviral vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. For the definitive proteomics assay, a total of 15 × 6-cm plates of JAR cells were transfected per construct (GST or GST-WDD (231–607)) and lysed 48 h after transfection. THP-1 cells transduced with GST or GST-WDD (231–607) were divided into two groups. One of them was activated with LPS (Sigma; 5 µg/ml) and PMA (Sigma; 50 ng/ml) for 24 h to favor expression of inflammatory mediators whereas the other one remained untreated. 60 × 10 cm plates were processed per condition in this case since chimera expression was lower compared to JAR cells. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) for 30 min on ice with occasional mild vortexing. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, diluted with the same buffer devoid of detergent to reach a final detergent concentration of 0.2%, and incubated for 3 h with agarose beads coupled to GSH (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C with rotation. Precipitates were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer (0.2% detergent), resuspended in 2x RSB and boiled. Samples were resolved in 10% poly-acrylamide gels and silver stained. Specific bands absent in control (GST) samples were excised and processed for proteomics identification. Protein digestion was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> with minor variations. Silver-stained gel plugs were destained with a solution containing 7.5 mM potassium ferricyanide and 25 mM sodium thiosulfate, rinsed in water and dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile. Plugs were then DTT reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI; 6 ng/µl in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate) was added before incubation at 37 °C for 18 h. Tryptic peptides were dried in a speed vacuum system, desalted by using C18-homemade columns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> and analyzed by reversed-phased LC-MS/MS using a nanoAcquity UPLC (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) coupled to a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo-Fisher, San Jose, CA). Separations were done in a BEH 1.7 µm, 130 Å, 75 µm × 100 mm C18 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) at a 400-nL/min flow rate. Injected samples were trapped on a Symmetry, 5 µm particle size, 180 µm × 20 mm C18 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Peptides were eluted using a 30 min gradient from 3 to 35% B (0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile). The LTQ-Orbitrap Velos was operated in a data-dependent MS/MS mode using Xcalibur (Thermo-Fisher, San Jose, CA). Survey scans were acquired in the mass range 400–1600 m/z, with 30,000 resolution at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 400 and lock mass option enabled for the 445.120025 ion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. The 20 most intense peaks having ≥2 charge state and above 500 intensity threshold were selected in the ion trap for fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation. MASCOT [v 2.3] and Sequest HT [v 1.3] search algorithms were used for searching the acquired MS/MS spectra using Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer software (v. 1.4.1.14) against a database of human sequences (Uniprot, release 2013_05) with common contaminants. Search parameters were as follows: fully tryptic digestion with up to two missed cleavages, 10 ppm and 0.8 Da mass tolerances for precursor and product ions, respectively, oxidation of methionine was established as variable modification and carbamidomethylation of cysteine as fixed modification. 1% false discovery rate using Percolator was used for peptide validation. The crude lists of identified proteins (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">1</xref>) were manually curated to eliminate non-human references and redundant hits, and to find in all cases the equivalent reviewed Uniprot reference. We implemented a filtration step using the Crapome sever (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://crapome.org/">http://crapome.org/</ext-link>) to eliminate hits present in more than 10% of the control proteomics assays included in this database (thus likely to be artifacts). Such curation steps resulted in secondary lists of non-redundant and fully reviewed Uniprot entries annotated for function (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">2</xref>). The reviewed lists were subjected to a Venn analysis to find out the degree of redundancy of the identified proteins in the three experimental systems analyzed (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">3</xref>).

30190207	        <p id="p0155">With the identified impact of PGE<sub>2</sub> on the expression of markers of stem cells and the reported beneficial effect on in vitro expansion of intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0160">32</xref>], we performed single-cell reseeding experiments in order to measure the direct effect of PGE<sub>2</sub> on the fraction of cells with self-renewal properties. Whereas pretreatment with TNF alone did not significantly alter organoid-forming capacity, the combination with PGE<sub>2</sub> led to a significant reduction in organoid-forming efficiency when compared with control samples (P &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>a, b). Despite the previously reported role of PGE<sub>2</sub> as supporting long-term maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0160">32</xref>], treatment with PGE<sub>2</sub> alone reduced the organoid-forming efficiency when compared with unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>a, b). In line with the reduced self-renewal capacity and the observed reduction in the expression of stem cell marker genes in the RNAseq experiments, organoids treated with TNF and PGE<sub>2</sub> also expressed lower levels of the adult stem cell marker <italic>LGR5</italic> and the proliferation marker <italic>KI67</italic> when compared with unstimulated control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>c, d, <xref ref-type="graphic" rid="f0035">Fig. S3</xref>).

Of note, Annexin A1 (<italic>ANXA1</italic>), which is expressed specifically by the repairing epithelium following tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0165">33</xref>], was upregulated on PGE<sub>2</sub> stimulation suggesting that this is associated with a change in cellular identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>e). Analysis of microarray expression profiles obtained from intestinal biopsies of patients with active UC and healthy control subjects demonstrated a significant correlation between <italic>ANXA1</italic> expression and disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>f). Additionally, previously published expression data (GSE14580) of intestinal biopsies from patients with UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0145">29</xref>], including Rs and PNRs to TNF inhibitors, showed that the expression of both <italic>COX-2</italic> and <italic>ANXA1</italic> indeed are elevated in PNRs when compared with Rs and healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>g, h).

Sequencing was performed on biological triplicates on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and generated ∼69 million 100 bp paired end reads per sample (data deposited in GEO under accession number GSE80082). Sequenced reads were trimmed to 75 base pairs and mapped to the Refseq genome model, using RSEM (v.1.2.21). RSEM uses the bowtie2 alignment tool. Gene counts were filtered to remove genes with 10 or fewer mapped reads per sample. TMM (treated mean of M-values) normalisation and differential expression analysis using the negative binomial model was carried out with the R-Bioconductor package ‘EdgeR’. Genes with logCPM&gt;1 and FDR&lt;0.05 were judged to be differentially expressed. Enrichments of pathway, category and motif gene sets were assessed using GSEA with logFC pre-ranked gene lists. Gene sets with an enrichment false discovery rate (FDR) value of less than 0.05 were judged to be strongly statistically significant and values of less than 0.25 significant.</p>

31412637	        <p>Rapid advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows measurement of the expression of genes at single-cell resolution in complex disease or tissue. While many methods have been developed to detect cell clusters from the scRNA-seq data, this task currently remains a main challenge. We proposed a multi-objective optimization-based fuzzy clustering approach for detecting cell clusters from scRNA-seq data. First, we conducted initial filtering and SCnorm normalization. We considered various case studies by selecting different cluster numbers (<inline-formula><ns1:math id="mm1"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>c</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>l</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula> = 2 to a user-defined number), and applied fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm individually. From each case, we evaluated the scores of four cluster validity index measures, Partition Entropy (<inline-formula><ns1:math id="mm2"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>P</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>E</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula>), Partition Coefficient (<inline-formula><ns1:math id="mm3"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>P</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>C</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula>), Modified Partition Coefficient (<inline-formula><ns1:math id="mm4"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>M</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>P</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>C</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula>), and Fuzzy Silhouette Index (<inline-formula><ns1:math id="mm5"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>F</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>S</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>I</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula>). Next, we set the first measure as minimization objective (↓) and the remaining three as maximization objectives (↑), and then applied a multi-objective decision-making technique, TOPSIS, to identify the best optimal solution. The best optimal solution (case study) that had the highest TOPSIS score was selected as the final optimal clustering. Finally, we obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Limma through the comparison of expression of the samples between each resultant cluster and the remaining clusters. We applied our approach to a scRNA-seq dataset for the rare intestinal cell type in mice [GEO ID: GSE62270, 23,630 features (genes) and 288 cells]. The optimal cluster result (TOPSIS optimal score= 0.858) comprised two clusters, one with 115 cells and the other 91 cells. The evaluated scores of the four cluster validity indices, <inline-formula><ns1:math id="mm6"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>F</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>S</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>I</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><ns1:math id="mm7"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>P</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>E</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><ns1:math id="mm8"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>P</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>C</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><ns1:math id="mm9"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>M</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>P</ns1:mi><ns1:mi>C</ns1:mi></ns1:mrow></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula> for the optimized fuzzy clustering were 0.482, 0.578, 0.607, and 0.215, respectively. The Limma analysis identified 1240 DEGs (cluster 1 vs. cluster 2). The top ten gene markers were <italic>Rps21, Slc5a1, Crip1, Rpl15, Rpl3, Rpl27a, Khk, Rps3a1, Aldob</italic> and <italic>Rps17</italic>. In this list, <italic>Khk</italic> (encoding ketohexokinase) is a novel marker for the rare intestinal cell type. In summary, this method is useful to detect cell clusters from scRNA-seq data.</p>
31412637	        <p>In this study, we first proposed single-cell cluster identification method based on multi-objective optimization for scRNA-seq gene expression data. The R code is available at <uri ns0:href="https://github.com/sauravmtech2/MOO-FUZZ-for-scRNAseq-">https://github.com/sauravmtech2/MOO-FUZZ-for-scRNAseq-</uri>. Then, we evaluated the method by using the count data of “<italic>Whole Organoid Replicate 1</italic>” within a single-cell mRNA sequencing dataset (GEO ID: GSE62270). This dataset has initially contained 23,630 features (genes) and 288 cells in mice. Here, we provided our evaluate results.</p>
31412637	      <p>Of note, our study was conducted on a publicly available dataset GEO ID: GSE62270 that was published by Grun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-genes-10-00611">23</xref>]. In the dataset, Grun et al. proposed RaceID method and performed an initial analysis with the published dataset. They had selected multiple cell types, such as organoid, Lgr5, Reg4, etc. and then performed analysis on them, whereas we chose only an organoid, “Whole Organoid Replicate 1” that composed of several cell types, and then conducted our analysis using our proposed framework. Our main objective behind our study is to propose a new method to identify cell clusters using multi-objective fuzzy clustering technique for single-cell data. To verify the performance of our method, we used this dataset. The method developed by Grun cell et al. was for rare cell type detection, whereas our method was developed only for cell-cluster identification through multi-objective optimization and fuzzy clustering. As the comparative study, our proposed method and RaceID both used some initial pre-filtering strategy such as cell filtering and gene (feature) filtering. During pre-filtering, we applied a recent robust normalization technique, SCnorm made for single-cell sequencing data, but in RaceID, the total transcript count across each cell was normalized to the median transcript number toward cells. Thereafter, RaceID used k-means clustering algorithm while the number of cluster was determined from “gap statistics” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-genes-10-00611">23</xref>], whereas our proposed method used the stronger clustering algorithm, fuzzy c-means in which the number of cluster was determined by a multi-objective optimization technique, TOPSIS on the four cluster validity index measures, PE, PC, MPC, and FSI of which first one was minimization index and remaining three were maximization indices. Since our method focused on optimizing the cell clusters depending upon the quality of clusters, our technique of identifying cell clusters was obviously stronger than the cell-cluster identification approach used in RaceID. On the other hand, RaceID can detect outlier cells (rare cells) from the resultant clusters, whereas we did not do anything in our study to identify outliers (rare cells). In future, we will extend our work to detect rare cells for single-cell RNA-seq data. In case of our analysis, the number of cells was 206 after initial filtering. Here through integrated use of fuzzy clustering and TOPSIS multi-objective optimization technique, we obtained optimal cluster result (TOPSIS optimal score = 0.8584) that comprised of two optimal cell clusters, one containing 115 cells and another with 91 cells. The evaluated scores of the four cluster validity indices, FSI, PE, PC, and MPC for the optimized fuzzy clustering were 0.482, 0.578, 0.607 and 0.215, respectively. In case of the analysis by Grun et al, six cell clusters had been identified through k-means clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-genes-10-00611">23</xref>].</p>

Probe fluorescence is determined as log-transformed value or as 2 to the power of the log-transformed value. In comparisons of gene expression profiles between two sample groups, the average log-transformed values for both groups were subtracted and the fold increase in probe fluorescence was calculated as 2 to the power of this difference (2<sup>avg1-avg2</sup>). Expression profiles could not be determined for all genes that have been described as (non-)hematopoietic lineage specific markers due to probe absence on the Illumina HT12.0 array or inclusion of probes showing overall non-significant fluorescence.</p>

Immunostaining for GFP to detect Lgr5 expression was performed on frozen sections or paraffin-embedded sections using rabbit anti-GFP (2956, clone: D5.1, Cell Signaling, 1:100) antibody. For DAB staining, slides were then incubated with amino acid polymer conjugated with peroxidase and Fab’ (Histofine simple stain rabbit MAX-PO (R), 414341, Nichirei Bioscience Inc.).

Microarray analysis was conducted by Toray Industries (Tokyo, Japan). In brief, extracted total RNA was checked with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and labeled with Cy5 and Cy3. The labeled RNAs were hybridized onto a Human Oligo chip 25k (Toray Industries). After stringent washing, the fluorescent signals were scanned with a 3D-Gene Scanner (Toray Industries) and analyzed using the 3D-Gene Extraction software (Toray Industries). The raw data for each spot were normalized by subtraction of the mean background signal intensity determined from the signal intensities of all blank spots with 95% confidence intervals. The relative expression level was calculated by comparing the signal intensities of the valid spots throughout the microarray experiments.

29339412	  <body><p>Anterior Gradient-2 (AGR2)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein disulfide isomerase superfamily member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) that is up-regulated in a large number of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Three biological paradigms have emerged from studies on AGR2. The first paradigm holds that the normal cell adhesion associated function of AGR2 is exploited as an oncogenic signal in cancer development. This concept was developed based on data demonstrating that AGR2 protein is required to assemble the dorso-anterior ectoderm that forms the cement gland in vertebrates thus maintaining forebrain integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The cement gland mediates the attachment of the growing epithelium to a solid support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Subsequent data highlighting a role for AGR2 in mammalian cancer-associated cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) provided the link between the normal developmental function of AGR2 and its oncogenic activity.</p><p>The second paradigm maintains that the normal cell migration-promoting function of AGR2 that mediates the regeneration of limb of amphibian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) is exploited as an oncogenic signal during cancer progression. Consistent with this data, recent studies have also highlighted that topical application of AGR2 protein can accelerate wound-healing in mammalian models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Finally, studies in transgenic mice have shown that AGR2-null animals are defective in mucin production, have alterations in asthma incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and are primed to develop inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This third paradigm, therefore, claims that the ability of AGR2 to mediate oncogenic growth is linked to its ability to catalyze the maturation of cysteine-rich receptors that play cancer associated functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recent data has further highlighted an extracellular role for AGR2 in promoting cancer growth and complex organoid structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Thus, the three paradigms derived from normal developmental biology have suggested that the cancer-associated function for AGR2 derives from its ability to promote cell adhesion, stimulate cell migration through an extra-cellular activity, and catalyze plasma membrane receptor trafficking through an intra-cellular function. The biochemical mechanisms underlying how AGR2 mediates these three biological pathways are not fully defined.</p><p>The ER organelle is a site of protein folding and assembly. Thioredoxin-type molecular chaperones like AGR2 presumably enable the folding and trafficking of cysteine-rich transmembrane receptors with complex protein folding requirements. Classic thioredoxins have a conserved thioredoxin fold comprised of the CxxC motif that mediates covalent bond formation with cysteine-containing client proteins followed by resolution through cycles of reduction-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). AGR2, by contrast, is part of the thioredoxin superfamily that contain CxxS motifs and which lack the ability to exploit a two-cysteine redox system that classically mediates client protein oxidation and reduction cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Through this single cysteine, AGR2 can mediate the maturation of receptors including MUC5 family and MUC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Trafficking of EGFR to the plasma membrane through AGR2-dependent catalysis in cancers might also be important for its' oncogenic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) because AGR2-negative cells fail to localize EGFR to its membrane destination. Presumably, AGR2 interacts with EGFR in the ER and facilitates its' folding and maturation, although there is no evidence for this. There might also be trafficking-independent functions for AGR2 in cancer. AGR2 overexpression in isogenic cancer cells can upregulate the proliferation biomarker Ki67 and the tumor modifier TSG101 resulting in p53 protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and AGR2 has extra-cellular oncogenic roles independent of its intra-cellular ER secretory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its classic thioredoxin fold, additional structure-function features of AGR2 protein are emerging. In addition to its N-terminal ER-leader sequence, and degenerated C-terminal ER-retention site (KTEL), there are additional peptide motifs that impact on its protein-protein interactions. The protein can exist as a homodimer through protein-protein contacts stabilized by an EALYK motif from amino acids 60–64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). An N-terminal stretch of amino acids from 21–40 are intrinsically disordered and negative regulatory dimer stability; it is striking that deletion of the N-terminal 40 amino acids of AGR2 can increase dimer stability by three orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). These data indicate that the full-length AGR2 might have a propensity to exist in a monomeric rather than a fully dimeric state. The function of this weak dimeric structure of AGR2 is becoming apparent. The monomeric E60A mutant of AGR2 is fully active in cell-adhesion activity, whereas deletion of amino acids 21–40 that removes the intrinsically disordered domain attenuates its migration function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). These data together suggest that monomeric form of AGR2 is responsible for its' cell adhesion functions.</p><p>There are very few well-validated binding proteins for AGR2 that explain its oncogenic activity. One yeast two-hybrid screen identified the oncogenic membrane receptor Dystroglycan, although this protein-protein interaction is largely unvalidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Nevertheless, antibodies to Dystroglycan or AGR2 can inhibit cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Another yeast-two hybrid screen has identified a set of AGR2-interacting proteins that provide clues into its intracellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). One of the most well-validated of these protein-protein interactions is with the hexameric molecular chaperone and AAA+ superfamily protein Reptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Reptin binds to a divergent hydrophobic peptide motif on AGR2 (amino acids 104–111) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). New drug leads that bind to the Walker-A ATP-binding pocket of Reptin can also stimulate Reptin binding to AGR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Deletion of the N-terminal domain of AGR2 (<italic>e.g.</italic> stabilizing the dimeric form) can stimulate binding of AGR2 to Reptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). These data together suggest that the monomeric and dimeric forms of AGR2 can have distinct functions. Whether Reptin and AGR2 cooperate in protein-folding pathways remains unknown.</p><p>Molecular chaperones and protein disulfide isomerases are generally thought to interact non-specifically with hydrophobic polypeptide regions or cysteine residues, respectively. Accordingly, then, perhaps the most striking feature of AGR2 protein is its ability to bind to peptides in a sequence-specific manner. The AGR2 protein was screened for peptide binding aptamers using peptide-phage libraries resulting in the acquisition of two types of peptides that bind to different domains on the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, the function of this sequence-specific peptide binding function of AGR2 has not been defined. In the case of perhaps the most well-characterized specific peptide-binding protein, MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), the function of this peptide binding motif is to drive selective interaction with several interacting proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we probed this specific peptide binding function of AGR2 to define a possible biological function for this activity. For example, the interaction site could form a docking site for client proteins that enter the ER or it could simply be involved in trafficking AGR2 through adaptor proteins. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was first applied to determine whether a specific peptide-docking site could be mapped on AGR2. Subsequently, an optimized consensus site for AGR2 binding peptides was used to search for human proteins with this consensus motif. An enrichment of transmembrane proteins containing the motif was identified suggesting that a major role for this motif could be in binding to client proteins destined for membrane localizations. A specific protein-protein interaction with the oncogenic membrane receptor EpCAM was validated. This suggests a mechanism for how this docking site on EpCAM can impact on the AGR2-EpCAM protein-protein interaction. These data have implications for how this ER-resident chaperone mediates maturation of proteins destined for the plasma membrane. During these studies, a clinical proteomics analysis using resected biopsies from patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma identified AGR2 and EpCAM as highly expressed in primary adenocarcinoma as well as cancer-associated lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). This allows scientific information acquired on AGR2 and EpCAM pathway regulation to be translated into novel therapeutics that target the AGR2:EpCAM axis for improved cancer management.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title /><sec><title /><sec><title>Chemicals, Antibodies, and Peptides</title><p>All chemicals and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and of high purity or HPLC spectral grade.

EpEX (amino acid 24–265 of accession number NM_002354) was chemically synthesized and human codon optimized (GeneArt Gene Synthesis, ThermoFisher Scientific) and cloned into pET151/<sc>d</sc>-TOPO harboring 6x His epitope tag followed by TEV protease site fused to N terminus of EpEX. Mutants His-AGR2 and His-EpCAM were made according to the protocol described in QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) using High Fidelity PCR, 2x <italic>Pfu</italic> Turbo master mix (Rovalab). AGR2 mutants pmAGR2D132A (containing Asp132 to Ala), pmAGR2P133A (containing Pro133 to Ala), pmAGR2S134A (containing Ser134 to Ala) were generated using AGR2-D132A-F and AGR2-D132-R, AGR2-P133A-F and AGR2-P133A-R, and AGR2-S134A-F and AGR2-S134A-R mutagenic primers respectively as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">Table II</xref> using pmAGR2 as a template.

When lysates from untreated cells are incubated with streptavidin beads coated with Peptide A4, monomeric AGR2 protein can be affinity purified from the crude lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, lane 4 <italic>versus</italic> Load, Flow-though, and wash, lanes 1–3). In addition, the chemically stabilized dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, lane 5) can also be affinity purified using the Peptide A4 coupled beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, lane 8 <italic>versus</italic> 5–7).

These data indicate that Peptide A4 can be used to affinity purify dimeric or monomeric protein and suggest the bioactivity of this peptide motif in crude lysates to AGR2 is relatively specific. However, the silver stain gel does reveal high molecular mass proteins that might either be binding to the peptide direct or through association with AGR2. These potential AGR2 binding proteins that were in these fractions were not evaluated. Nevertheless, the relative specificity of this peptide for AGR2, as defined by its ability to affinity purify the protein from crude lysates, suggests that this feature of AGR2 might selectively drive (some of) its protein-protein interaction functions. Thus, we continued to characterize this specific peptide binding activity to discover bonafide client proteins that harbor this consensus peptide motif.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The specificity of an AGR2-binding peptide aptamer for use in the affinity purification of <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-linked AGR2 protein from crude lysates</bold>. <italic>Affinity purification of AGR2 from crude cell lysates</italic>.

Such data might indicate whether specific peptide binding is a function of AGR2 or whether proteins with this motif that bind AGR2 impact on its' structure. When a protein binds to a ligand the kinetics of hydrogen-deuterium exchange can be altered at amide bonds that can reflect conformational changes or binding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and this method was used to determine whether the peptide-A4 interacts with any specificity on AGR2 and/or whether it alters AGR2 protein conformation. We had previously set up hydrogen-deuterium exchange using the N-terminal domain of MDM2 protein (amino acids 1–126) as a model system to define effects of ligand binding on the exchange reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and the methodology in this study used <italic>ExPro Script</italic> to measure deuteration rates. Because this data was published, a new software package became available for use by life scientists (<italic>HDExaminer</italic>). This provides an additional robust tool to study protein dynamics in solution using deuterium exchange methodologies. We first evaluated, therefore, MDM2-ligand binding using HDExaminer as a positive control to measure the integrity of the data acquired using our methodology including; sample acidification after deuteration, freezing, thawing, and injection onto an immobilized pepsin column (flow rate 100 μl/minute), peptide trapping and desalting using a peptide microtrap for 3 min at flow rate 50 μl/minute and peptide separation using an analytical column with a linear gradient.</p><p>MDM2 is an oncoprotein with a druggable peptide-binding pocket that can be studied using the ligand Nutlin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This ligand mimics the p53 peptide and binds stably within its N-terminal hydrophobic pocket. Full-length MDM2 was deuterated without or with Nutlin-3 using the hydrogen-deuterium exchange methodology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.000573/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>). Purified full-length MDM2 (2 μ<sc>m</sc>) was incubated with DMSO or the ligand Nutlin-3 (1:4 ratio) for one hour, diluted in a 10-fold excess of D<sub>2</sub>O buffer, and processed with immobilized pepsin (as described above) to define changes in deuteration of peptic products. The data show, as expected, suppression of deuteration at the N-terminal drug-binding pocket of MDM2 from amino acids 56–103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Suppression of deuteration from amino acids 245–265 might reflect allosteric effects of the drug on MDM2 protein conformation or it might reflect an interaction with Nutlin-3 at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Amino acid residues ranging from 20–50 also show suppressed deuteration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) suggesting conformational changes occur outside and adjacent to the Nutlin-3 binding pocket.

Peptic cleavage is not completely random throughout the sequence and can generally be grouped into four distinct domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). These domains contain (1) the N-terminal domain from amino acids 21–53 that harbor intrinsically disordered sequences that negatively regulate dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>); (2) the central domain containing amino acids 54–108 that harbor the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), the CXXS thioredoxin fold, and the Reptin docking site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>); (3) a region N-terminal to the specific peptide-binding domain (amino acids 109–130; this study); and (4) the specific peptide binding domain adjacent to the ER retention site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). Preferred cleavage sites or hotspots of pepsin cleavage can be visualized such as Thr23 (in the N-terminal disordered region; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), Tyr63 (within the dimer interface of 60-EALYK-64), Ile74 (N-terminal to the CxxS motif), and Val110 (within the Reptin binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). The existence of four regions with a degree of pepsin preference, suggests some secondary/tertiary conformation is maintained on acidification. It is interesting to note that very few peptides were obtained covering the complete dimerization motif from amino acids 60–64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>C; highlighted by bracketed amino acids within sequencing EALYK). In fact, a hotspot of cleavage is at Tyr63 (within the dimer interface of 60-EALYK-64) suggesting this region is relatively more susceptible to proteolysis when in the acidified and denatured state.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Peptic coverage of AGR2 protein in the seven-point deuteration reaction time course.</bold>

Although in EpCAM binding, S134A&gt;D132A&gt;P133A = wt-AGR2 with two mutants showing a gain-of-function. These data suggest that although mutating some amino acids in the VDPSL motif can impact on specific peptide binding, the global conformation changed induced by loop mutation (for example in the gain-of-function S134A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>) might result in binding to a distinct site on the EpCAM molecule.

At the earlier time point of 600 s of incubation in deuterated buffer, there was selective suppression of deuteration of peptide fragments from amino acids 147–206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>A</italic>).

These two regions form a discontinuous epitope in 2-dimensions but are proximal in 3-dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>D</italic>, in red).

Higher AGR2/EpCAM protein ratios (greater than 4:1) resulted in general deuterium suppression over the majority of the EpCAM peptic fragments (data not shown), thus the ratio we used is optimized to capture the most dominant and specific AGR2 interaction sites on EpCAM protein.</p><fig id="F14" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 14.</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping the AGR2-binding site on EpCAM using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.</bold> The indicated wt or mutated (Y251A) versions of EpCAM were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with buffer only or AGR2 protein at a molar ratio of AGR2/EpCAM of 4:1.

This also suggests the detergent binding pocket might also represent a protein-interaction site in EpCAM. Another interpretation of this data is that AGR2 “chaperonin” functions might alter the conformation of EpCAM near the TLIYY motif and then dissociate from EpCAM. Accordingly, the deuterium suppression observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>B</italic>) might relate to a conformational change in EpCAM and not reflect the direct stable binding site of AGR2 protein. Nevertheless, there appears to be a role for the TLIYY motif in the deuterium suppression on EpCAM, because AGR2 does not induce any detectable change in EpCAM<sup>Y251A</sup> protein under these same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>C</italic>). This is consistent with the attenuated binding of AGR2 to EpCAM<sup>Y251A</sup> protein using ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). The data together suggest that the “weak” TLIYY docking site in EpCAM might form a “landing pad” that directs AGR2 into a more stable fit at adjacent motifs. This is reminiscent of previous mapping of a novel, “weak” or transient Nutlin-3 binding site on the rim of the hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. This latter data suggested that the weak Nutlin-3 nucleation site in MDM2 directs the molecule into the deep MDM2 pocket for a more stable fit at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Discovering protein-protein interactions for a target is a key aim in life sciences(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and is especially important where genetic screens are not available to define pathway functions. AGR2 exists only in vertebrate lineage thus limiting the possibility for developing genetic screens to define function. Thus, we need to rely on interactomics to expand on our knowledge of AGR2 function. Yeast-two hybrid methods have identified potentially important AGR2-binding proteins. The first yeast-two hybrid identified the membrane receptor and pro-metastatic protein Dystroglycan/C4.4a as an AGR2 interactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and the newt homolog of AGR2 was shown to bind to the receptor Prod1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). These data are consistent with the emerging paradigm that AGR2 stimulates receptor maturation linked to growth or adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Another yeast-two hybrid screen revealed that AGR2 could bind not only to membrane receptors but many nuclear proteins such as RIP140 and Reptin, which might reflect a role for the form of AGR2 that escapes the ER through its non-canonical KDEL retention sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The most well characterized AGR2 binding interactor is the AAA+ superfamily chaperone protein Reptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, perhaps the most intriguing biochemical function for AGR2 is in its intrinsic sequence-specific peptide-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In this report, we exploit this specific “peptide-binding” function of AGR2 to (1) propose a consensus-binding motif for its client proteins; (2) highlight that this motif is enriched in transmembrane proteins; and (3) characterize one such novel client protein, the oncogenic receptor EpCAM.</p><p>The majority of protein sequence information in higher eukaryotes is encoded by the “linear motif”; perhaps millions of such motifs are comprised of small stretches of amino acids that drive relatively weak but specific protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). A powerful tool to define the linear motif repertoire for a protein is the peptide-phage combinatorial library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). This methodology has been used to define the peptide consensus motif for the peptide binding groove of the oncoprotein MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This information stimulated the development of peptide mimetics that inhibit MDM2 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). This methodology has also been used to define PxxP consensus binding motifs for the transcriptional coactivator p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). When AGR2 was subjected to a peptide-phage library screen, a pentapeptide docking motif emerged as TTIYY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). There were two distinct peptides selected in this latter study, but we had only focused on the one with the TTIYY motif. The specificity of the TTIYY peptide in binding to its target in crude lysates was evaluated using affinity purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The TTIYY-containing peptide could be used to affinity purify AGR2 from cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) or human tissue biopsies with a high specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This suggests that the peptide could act as a highly specific recognition motif for AGR2 target proteins. However, our data using fluorescence polarization assays indicate that the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> for AGR2 binding to free consensus site containing peptides in solution is in the range of 15–45 μ<sc>m</sc> (data not shown), suggesting the interaction, though very specific, is also very weak. These data suggest that although AGR2 might bind specifically to such motifs, the affinity is weak enough to allow rapid association-dissociation events that would presumably be important for its chaperone cycle in cells.</p><p>The human proteome was scanned for proteins containing this motif to produce a set of potential AGR2-client proteins and there was a relative enrichment in transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). EpCAM was chosen as the target of choice and its paralog also shows identity in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>). The consensus motif within EpCAM forms a β-strand within the main α-β fold in the EpCAM structure and is adjacent to a detergent binding pocket, defined by PDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" ns0:href="4MZV">4MZV</ext-link>). EpCAM mutation at Y251 prevents the receptor from reaching its normal destination at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>) and this mutation also attenuates stable AGR2-binding as defined using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>). It has been noted that linear motifs can reside within intrinsically disordered domains or they can reside within structural domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). In the case of the linear motif within disordered regions, it is known that they can acquire distinct secondary structures depending on the nature of the protein-interaction. If the linear motif resides within a structural domain, the protein-protein interaction presumably requires an alternate conformation at the target site. Using EpCAM as a model, we can speculate that AGR2 might interact with an unfolded version of EpCAM as the receptor is being assembled in the ER. Alternatively, AGR2 might interaction with the receptor as its conformation is altered especially as the peptide-docking site is near the single-pass transmembrane domain.</p><p>By defining a peptide consensus for AGR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>), we were able to search for additional human proteins that might harbor this motif. Two different search engines were used for this. Transmembrane proteins predominated using <italic>ScanProsite</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>) whereas proteins within the Golgi/ER or exosomes particles predominant using <italic>SLiMSEARCH4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>G</italic>). There is a degree of specificity in this peptide motif, as a prior selection of peptides from phage libraries to p300 identified PxxP motif proteins that predominate in transcription factors like SMAD4 and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). The implication of this data is that the specific docking site of AGR2 is used to interact with client proteins that enter the ER or through trafficking. We had also characterized another receptor that has the AGR2 consensus linear motif site; the transmembrane protein Meckelin-3 (TMEM67; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). Mutating one of the several AGR2 consensus motifs on MKS3 impaired its ability to be assembled into the plasma membrane (M. Lawrence, PhD thesis (University of Edinburgh), manuscript in preparation) providing the proof-of-concept that receptors other than EpCAM might exploit an AGR2 docking motif for polypeptide folding or maturation.</p><p>The EpCAM receptor was validated as a putative, novel AGR2 client protein. We can speculate that because the docking site is in the C terminus of EpCAM adjacent to the single pass transmembrane domain if AGR2 binds to this inside the ER, the motif could impact on how the protein folds as it enters the ER. Because stable binding exists adjacent to this TLIYY motif within a detergent binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>), this might reflect a chaperonin binding domain for AGR2 as it directs EpCAM folding in cells. The docking site might direct AGR2 to EpCAM to allow the correct formation of key disulfide bonds. Alternatively, the docking site might facilitate AGR2-mediated transport of EpCAM cargo as it is transported in a partially folded state to the plasma membrane. A key observation is that in cells, the EpCAM-Y251A mutant protein fails to reach its normal plasma membrane destination but is present in the cytosol or nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). There is a redox component to this docking site <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>), suggesting that disulfide bridge formation in the EpCAM protein can impact on how AGR2 binds in cells, although cell-based di-sulfide shuttling assays might be more difficult to reconstitute in cell systems. Future cell-based assay developments can impact on understanding how the “detergent binding site” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>) and/or the EpCAM docking site (amino acids 247–251) facilitates its maturation or trafficking. For example, it would be interesting to generate a gain-of-function AGR2-S134, cysteine-mutated EpCAM, or “detergent-binding domain” mutant EpCAM derived cell models using CRISPR gene editing to measure changes in the flux of EpCAM receptor maturation as a result of such mutations. A second key observation in cellular based assays is that untagged endogenously expressed EpCAM and AGR2 can colocalize in cells, as defined by Proximity Ligation assays. This method is a tool that improves on the immunoprecipitation method for validating or identifying interacting proteins because the proteins are analyzed <italic>in situ</italic> and the interaction is limited by distance constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). The cytosolic association between AGR2 and EpCAM using proximity ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>) is consistent with cytosolic interaction observed using GFP and mCHERRY tagged ectopically expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was applied to determine whether a specific binding site of the TTIYY containing peptide could be identified on AGR2.

The methodology has been validated using proteins for nearly 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Although the translation from mass spectrometric laboratories to cell biology fields has not been so widespread, new software might accelerate translation to the life sciences. The technical methodology uses certain assumptions that can impact on data interpretation. For example, the use of pepsin at low pH to fragment a “denatured,” deuterated protein into “random” overlapping polypeptides has limitations. As highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, pepsin treatment of AGR2 does not produce a theoretically perfect overlapping peptic series, with “hotspots” of cleavage that reside proximal to particular functional domains. This suggests that there are significant secondary structural elements at low pH that can hinder pepsin cleavage, as the target protein is not fully denatured. Such an imperfect peptic product series reduces the extent of high-resolution fine-mapping of ligand binding effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) and/or conformational effects of a missense mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref>). In our report, the most likely peptide A4-binding site on AGR2 was localized to amino acids 131–139 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) and on Nutlin-3 binding to MDM2 to broad regions within two distinct functional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Under these conditions, hydrogen-deuterium exchange can be considered a low-resolution structural tool that identifies functional motifs. The method also has the advantage of requiring relatively small amounts of protein, although another limitation is that the target protein requires significant dilution with D<sub>2</sub>O that might impact on conformational dynamics. Nevertheless, the hydrogen-deuterium exchange data allowed for orthogonal approaches that validated using mutagenesis the role of amino acids 131–135 in AGR2-peptide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref>).</p><p>A small region from amino acids 131–135 was identified in AGR2 as a likely, primary binding site for TTIYY motif-containing peptides, because it is here that the most significant deuterium suppression was observed after peptide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Additional residues C-terminal to the 131–135 amino acids motif, including RADITGRYSNRL, also show deuterium suppression by the consensus site peptide A4, however, this region was not evaluated by mutagenesis. We focused on amino acids 131–135 because this represents an exposed surface with an unstructured turn that might form a binding finger into hydrophobic TTIYY docking sites. To further validate this data, a set of mutants were created that exhibit a loss-of-function on synthetic peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that this motif is the major peptide-docking site. By contrast, the same series of AGR2 mutant proteins exhibited an inverse gain-of-function activity on the client protein EpCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>), whose interpretation is complicated because of the oxidation-dependent resilience of EpCAM to this AGR2 mutant series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). Nevertheless, the ability to create a loss or gain-of-function mutations in this region suggests that it not only provides a primary peptide- interaction site, but that the conformation of this region can allosterically affect distal regions that impact on monomer-dimer equilibrium. The enhanced binding of EpCAM to this S134A mutant also suggests that AGR2 might have a secondary binding site on EpCAM that is stabilized by the altered conformation of the S134A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref>). This potential secondary site appears to play only a minor role on wt-AGR2 protein because the EpCAM<sup>Y251A</sup> mutation attenuates wt-AGR2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>Another feature of the deuterated peptide data (for example, observed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.000573/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1, S3, S5, and S7</ext-link>) and in other studies using HDX Workbench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) or HDExaminer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) is that larger peptide fragments can have a different number of deuteron exchanges than predicted within smaller or partially overlapping fragments. For example, in AGR2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA118.000573/DC1">supplemental Fig. S3</ext-link>), the peptic peptide 17–56 shows a 30% deuteration exchange (corresponding to 10.8 deuterons), the embedded peptide 17–30 shows 55% deuteration (corresponding to 7.1 deuterons), and the overlapping peptide 31–52 shows 50% deuteration (corresponding to 9.5 deuterons). These inconsistencies in the number of deuterons exchanged relative to the expected levels, within overlapping peptides of different lengths or within smaller peptides embedded within larger peptides highlights, putative, could be due many factors such as secondary structural constraints under the low pH of the peptic reactions (as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) or by peptide length/charge state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). In addition, it is also possible that high levels of deuterium suppression in a small stretch of the polypeptide are compensated by elevated deuteration in adjacent regions (because of conformational changes) so that the net deuteration in larger peptides is different than the smaller peptide. This is relevant to AGR2 because it is diluted 10-fold in D<sub>2</sub>O during the deuteration reaction, during which the AGR2 concentration is far lower than the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> (of dimerization) that could in turn impact on its monomer-dimer equilibrium. Alternatively, there could also be variability in peptide back exchange where it has been reported that higher-order structures in a polypeptide might reduce or elevate the rates of hydrogen-deuterium exchange depending on the peptide length and/or sequence. The degree of secondary structural effects through peptide-column interactions can also impact on exchange rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Systematic studies on factors that can impact on back-exchange have identified an unexpected dependence on ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Considering these properties of the methodology, we can speculate that the linear gradient used in the separation of AGR2 peptic peptides might increase back-exchange on the column because they are eluted much later in the gradient than then their corresponding nested fragments. Despite these quantitative differences in expected deuteration rates because of the complexities of the methodology, the software can accurately quantify deuterium exchange rates using peptic peptides of the same length (sequence) but under different conditions (ligand or protein mutation; <italic>e.g.</italic> example peptides include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref><italic>B</italic>). With these limitations of the methodology, useful data can be acquired on ligand binding (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) or on heterologous protein-protein interaction motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, a methodology has been developed to exploit the linear peptide motif as a tool to discover new protein-protein interactions for a molecular chaperone. This includes (1) validating the specificity of a peptide(s) acquired from combinatorial peptide libraries as an affinity purification tool from crude cellular lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>); (2) using hydrogen-deuterium exchange to demonstrate a specific interaction site for the peptide that allowed the creation of mutants for validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> – 6); (3) using alanine scan mutagenesis to derive a linear motif consensus site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>); and (4) validating the EpCAM-AGR2 protein interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> – 14). These <italic>in vitro</italic> and cell-based methodologies provide a complementing approach to the yeast-two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation methodology to identify and validate new protein-protein interactions by exploiting the linear peptide motif as a common type of protein-protein interaction that is involved in dynamic protein-protein assembly reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Our data highlight that the EpCAM receptor has specific AGR2 binding regions. The recent identification that EpCAM and AGR2 proteins are coexpressed at a very high frequency in human esophageal adenocarcinoma cancer biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) provides a clinical rationale to further dissect the AGR2-EpCAM pathway control in relation to carcinogenesis and potential therapeutics in this cancer type.</p></sec><sec><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE repository with the data set identifier PXD005782.</p></sec>

31211831	        <p>We hypothesize that the discrepancy between the enzymatic capacity to produce butyrate and its concentration in feces could be explained by defects in the consumption of this metabolite in the context of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, first we established the effects of butyrate in the healthy epithelium using ex vivo human primary organoid cultures derived from Ctrl individuals. EpOCs were generated from colonic crypts and differentiated in vitro into d-EpOCs. Analysis of microarray gene expression data identified 2014 genes differentially expressed (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05; FDR ≤ 0.05) between EpOCs and d-EpOCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), which was in agreement with our previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref></sup> (GEO Series accession No. GSE75916; <uri ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse75916" ns0:type="simple">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse75916</uri>; last accessed 12 June 2019). The transcriptional signatures of EpOCs and d-EpOCs stimulated with 0.5 mM or 5 mM of butyrate for 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours were also analyzed. Principal component analysis (PCA) separated EpOC from d-EpOC populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Butyrate induced a dose- and time-dependent transcriptional signature in both EpOCs and d-EpOCs, having a more profound effect in the latter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Indeed, &gt;4000 genes (~50% of them upregulated) were significantly modulated by 5 mM of butyrate at 24 hours on d-EpOCs (FDR ≤ 0.05; |FC| ≥ 1.5).</p>
31211831	        <p>To mimic the effects of inflammation in the epithelium, d-EpOCs from healthy donors were stimulated with increasing doses of TNFα, a cytokine involved in the physiopathology of IBD.

29968757	        <p id="Par12">Importantly, we observed that pair-wise mutual information (MI) was not able to capture all the interactions among TFs in synergistic cores, supporting that these TFs interact synergistically rather than pair-wise (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>). For example, this was observed in the case of interaction between the three plutipotency TFs (NANOG, POU5F1, and SOX2) in hESC, and Runx1, Fli1, Gata2, and Tal1 in the blood progenitor subpopulation described above, due to the multifactorial nature of the transcriptional regulatory mechanism. On the contrary, a set of TFs exhibiting pair-wise interactions among themselves does not necessarily display a multiple synergistic interaction, and therefore will not represent a synergistic transcriptional core. To show this, we performed a topological analysis of subpopulation specific GRNs inferred from pair-wise co-expression to identify top 10 subpopulation-specific hubs that could potentially be TFs that define subpopulation identities. Results showed that only a few known TFs were recovered as unique hubs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>; Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>), indicating that transcriptional synergy is more suited for unraveling TFs that define subpopulation identities.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Unique top 10 hub TFs in GRNs for the example subpopulations in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1.

28626588	        <p>To discover novel regulators of the senescent phenotype, we used an established model of cellular senescence comprised of sustained epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition in HBE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>]. Cells treated with erlotinib or dimethylsulfoxide were incubated with the fluorescent senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) substrate C12FDG, and senescent cells were purified using flow cytometry according to the method of Debacq-Chainiaux <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>] and Yuan (in preparation). Subsequent gene expression analysis revealed significantly reduced expression of the epigenetic regulators CBX5, HELLS and UHRF1 in the senescent population compared with the non-senescent and dimethylsulfoxide controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>). Quantitative real-time PCR validation confirmed that the expression of HELLS and UHRF1 was strongly repressed as early as 18 h after senescence induction, whereas CBX5 downregulation was less robust and observed only at the 48-h time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>). Notably, <italic>UHRF1</italic> mRNA is also significantly decreased in replicative and oncogene-induced senescence based on two published gene expression data sets (GSE19864 and GSE19018). We confirmed the reduced protein expression of UHRF1 in these three senescent contexts using oncogenic H-Ras-overexpressing senescent IMR90 fibroblasts, late passage HBE cells and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition-induced senescent HBE cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>). To determine the functional significance of these findings, HELLS or UHRF1 expression was reduced using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown in HBE cells. Depletion of HELLS had no significant effect on HBE cell senescence as measured by Edu incorporation and SA-β-Gal staining (data not shown), which is consistent with previous findings in human fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>]. In contrast, UHRF1 knockdown resulted in major impairments in cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), mimicking the induction of cellular senescence triggered by epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition. Based on these results, we selected UHRF1 as a possible epigenetic regulator of the senescent state.</p>

30332774	        <p>The distribution and location of CTEN protein in normal cells are of particular importance in its biological activities. Previous studies have demonstrated that CTEN is highly expressed in prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijms-19-03190">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijms-19-03190">5</xref>] but the expression pattern in various types of prostate cells has not been determined. To clarify the cell-type-specific expression of CTEN, we first examined the levels of CTEN protein in primary epithelial, stromal and smooth muscle cells isolated from human prostate by Western analyses. The result showed that CTEN protein is highly abundant in the prostate epithelial cells but nearly undetectable in the prostate stromal and smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03190-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). Next, we further investigated the distribution of CTEN in the prostate epithelium by the analyses of publicly available online databases. Three datasets, including GSE89050, GSE86904 and GSE82071, were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and their gene expression profiles were analyzed by microarray (GSE89050 and GSE86904) or RNA-sequencing (GSE82071). In these datasets, benign human prostate specimen was dissociated into single cell and fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed to separate basal epithelial cells from luminal ones as described in Materials and Methods. We interrogated the expression of CTEN in prostate basal and luminal epithelial cells, which were discriminated based on the levels of CD49f (aka integrin α6), a prostate basal cell marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-ijms-19-03190">15</xref>]. In all the three datasets, CTEN mRNA transcripts are greatly increased in the subpopulation detected with high levels of CD49f (CD49f-H) compared to that detected with low levels of CD49f (CD49f-L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03190-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). It indicates that CTEN is predominantly expressed in the prostatic basal epithelial cells but decreased in the luminal subtypes.</p>
30332774	        <p>The gene expression datasets, including GSE89050, GSE86904 and GSE82071, were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The criteria of purification in these three datasets are slightly different. In GSE89050 dataset, CD45−/EpCAM+/CD49fHi is for basal cells and CD45−/EpCAM+/CD49fLo is for luminal cells. In GSE86904 dataset, EpCAM+/CD44−/CD49fHi is for basal cells and EpCAM+/CD44+/CD49fLo is for luminal cells. In GSE82071 dataset, Trop2+/CD49fHi is for basal cells and Trop2+/CD49fLo is for luminal cells. In this study, basal and luminal types of benign prostate epithelial samples from the datasets were analyzed. Quantile normalization of data sets was performed on NetworkAnalyst (available online: <uri ns0:href="http://www.networkanalyst.ca/faces/home.xhtml">http://www.networkanalyst.ca/faces/home.xhtml</uri>).

Control cells were treated with the vehicle, 0.2% (w/v) BSA in PBS. RNA was extracted by using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and quality was checked by using Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Bioanalyzer (Agilent). All RNA integrity values (RIN) were above 9. cDNA libraries were prepared from 1 ug RNA as template, using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced by using the paired-end option with 100 bp reads on Illumina HiSeq 2000 and min. 50 million reads were obtained per sample. Formatting and quality control (FASTQC v0.11.5, Babraham Institute) were performed by using the Galaxy platform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0155">[31]</xref> installed at the University of Bristol. The paired end reads were then aligned to the human genome (hg38) by using TopHat2 (v2.0.14) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0160">[32]</xref>. The resulting alignment files (BAM) files were uploaded to SeqMonk v1.38 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/).

The Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (ATTC, Manassas, VA) was used for testing SU-DIPG-XIII, XVII, XIX, and VI latest on 10 January 2020. All cells were cultured in tumor stem medium containing 50X B-27 Supplement Minus Vitamin A (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA), H-EGF at 20 ng/mL (Shenandoah Biotechnology, Warwick, PA), H-FGF-basic-154 at 20 ng/mL (Shenandoah Biotechnology, Warwick, PA), H-PDGF-AA at 10 ng/mL (Shenandoah Biotechnology, Warwick, PA), H-PDGF-BB at 10 ng/mL (Shenandoah Biotechnology, Warwick, PA), and 0.2% heparin solution at 2 μg/mL (STEMCELL Technologies, BC, Canada). All experiments used cells collected within 5 passages after thawing. The cells were passaged by the treatment of TrypLE (Gibco, Waltham, MA) and DNAse I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) rocking at 37°C for 5–15 minutes, then HBSS (Corning, Corning, NY) was added to deactivate TrypLE. The cells were transferred to new Nunc EasYFlask Cell Culture Flasks (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and grown in tumor stem medium as previously described.

SFRPs have been shown to have tumour suppressor functions in cancers such as medulloblastoma.

31166966	        <p>A total of 1,652 proteins were identified among which 1,203 proteins (72.8%) were commonly expressed in both histological types, 195 proteins (11.8%) were unique to SCLC, and 254 proteins (15.4%) were found only in LCNEC. The mass spectrometry data have been deposited to the PRIDE Archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/</ext-link>) via the PRIDE partner repository and jPOST with the data set identifier PXD013583 and JPST000587, respectively. Protein expression data obtained from FFPE clinical tissue specimens obtained by surgical resection from 12 patients are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217105.s006">S1 File</xref>. This demonstrated that both SCLC and LCNEC share the majority of expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217105.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). A hierarchical clustering was obtained by using the Ward method for proteins with their spectral counts identified for each patient.

GO analysis using PANTHER Ver. 11.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0217105.ref035">35</xref>] exhibited mostly similar profiles in gene hits.

29662201	        <p id="P8">To discover additional pathways contributing to the impaired proliferation in glucose deficiency, we performed microarray analysis on keratinocytes from <italic>K14.Glut1</italic> mice and their <italic>WT</italic> littermates (GSE102955, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3a</xref>). Consistent with the significantly decreased proliferative capacity of <italic>Glut1</italic> deficient keratinocytes, hierarchical clustering and gene ontology analyses revealed that genes related to the cell cycle progression and cell division were markedly impaired compared to keratinocytes from their <italic>WT</italic> littermates. Normal cells respond to oxidative stress by routing glucose through the pentose phosphate pathways (PPP) to regenerate NADPH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Consistent with glucose’s role in ROS clearance, transcripts related to redox homeostasis were amongst the most markedly elevated genes in keratinocytes from <italic>K14.Glut1</italic> mice compared <italic>WT</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3a</xref>). Twenty-four genes related to oxidative stress were more than 2 fold higher in <italic>Glut1</italic> deficient keratinocytes compared to <italic>WT</italic> keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3b</xref>). Other oxidative stress response genes including <italic>Nqo1</italic> and <italic>Hmox1</italic> (HO1) were significantly upregulated in Glut1 deficient keratinocytes both under basal growth conditions and when cells were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or UVB compared to <italic>WT</italic> keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). Confirming the impact of Glut1 on cellular levels of oxidative stress, measurements of DCFDA fluorescence revealed that keratinocytes from <italic>K14.Glut1</italic> mice showed significantly higher levels of reactive oxygen species both under basal growth conditions and after treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or UVB compared to <italic>WT</italic> keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). <italic>Glut1</italic> deficient keratinocytes were significantly more sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UVB induced cell death than <italic>WT</italic> keratinocytes even when controlling for their slower growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). The supplementation of antioxidants (GSH and NAC) rescued H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced toxicity in keratinocytes from <italic>K14.Glut1</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). In primary human keratinocytes, the acute inhibition of GLUT1 through WZB117 also increased the sensitivity of the cells to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c</xref>) and increased the expression of redox homeostasis genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2d</xref>). Both genetic and chemical inhibition of glucose transport lowered levels of NADPH compared to their respective controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2e–f</xref>), suggesting that decreased flux through the PPP contributed to the observed defects in redox homeostasis. MitoSOX staining further revealed that the acute (but not chronic) chemical inhibition of glucose transport increased mitochondrial oxidative stress compared to vehicle control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2g</xref>), suggesting mitochondria as an additional source of oxidative stress in keratinocytes deprived of glucose. Despite Nrf2’s established role in mediating the response to oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, total and nuclear levels of Nrf2 were not higher in keratinocytes from <italic>K14.Glut1</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a–b</xref>). Thus, Glut1 is required for redox homeostasis in keratinocytes at least in part through its roles in regenerating NADPH.</p>

29669006	        <p>To compare the mucosal transcriptional profiles between IBD patients and healthy controls, we analyzed the publicly available Leuven cohort (GSE16879), in which data were obtained from control, CD, and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients at the time of pre– and post–infliximab treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref></sup> A clear differentiation among the samples, depending on their disease activity, was observed when applying PCA using the given log2 microarray expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In the case of CD patients, 9872 gene expressions were found to be statistically different from those in healthy controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, transcriptome data of post-therapy samples from responders were clustered together and significantly away from the healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). These results suggest that the CD intestinal mucosa in responders is molecularly different from that of healthy controls in terms of gene expression. PCA analysis showed that CD and UC are indistinguishable, suggesting the molecular similarity of inflamed CD and UC colon in spite of some phenotypic differences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup4">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, which describes PCA of CD patients, UC patients, and healthy controls).</p>

29681888	        <p>Peptide iodination and radioligand-binding assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Briefly, 10 nmol Tyr<sup>11</sup>-somatostatin-14 (Tyr<sup>11</sup>–SST14, Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) were iodinated by the chloramin T method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) with 1 mCi carrier-free Na<sup>125</sup>I (NEZ033L010MC, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and purified by HPLC (Analytic HPLC 1200 Series, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (see Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). For competitive radioligand binding assays, 40,000 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and grown overnight. The next day, cells were incubated in binding buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% w/v BSA, cOmplete protease inhibitors) containing 100,000 counts per minute (cpm) [<sup>125</sup>I]-Tyr<sup>11</sup>-SST14 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptide. After 30 min at 37°C, cells were washed with ice-cold washing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mM NaCl, 0.05% w/v BSA), lysed with 1 N NaOH, transferred to vials, and measured in a gamma counter (Wallac 1470 Wizard, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The obtained cpm values were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5.04, and IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated by non-linear regression (one site—fit logIC<sub>50</sub>, least squares fit).</p>
29681888	      <p>As presentation of SSTR-binding sites at the cell surface is a prerequisite for functional response of NET cells to SSA treatment, a competitive radioligand binding assay was utilized to determine their binding capacity. While QGP-1, LCC-18, and H727 showed only background levels of [<sup>125</sup>I]-Tyr<sup>11</sup>-SST14 binding with no displacement by increasing amounts of either somatostatin-14 or octreotide, both BON and UMC-11 demonstrated binding above background that could be displaced by unlabeled somatostatin-14 (IC<sub>50</sub> values: 0.50 ± 0.16 nM in BON and 0.70 ± 0.29 nM in UMC-11), but not by octreotide, indicating a lack of binding sites for octreotide in all five NET cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). In order to examine whether this absence of binding was due to insufficient expression, all five SSTR subtypes were analyzed by RT–qPCR for their mRNA expression in the five NET cell lines under investigation and, for comparison, in 10 human normal tissues (5 from pancreas, 5 from small intestine) as well as 20 human NET tissues (10 from pancreatic NET, 10 from small intestinal NET). In all five cell lines, the expression of the receptor subtype with the highest affinity for SSAs used in the clinic, SSTR2, was at or below the level of expression in normal tissues and more than one order of magnitude lower than the median value of expression in NET tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). For BON, QGP-1, LCC-18, and UMC-11, SSTR2 expression was at least two orders of magnitude lower than in NET tissues. The receptor with the second highest affinity for clinically used SSAs, SSTR5, is also expressed at or below the median of normal tissues in QGP-1, LCC-18, and UMC-11, while in BON and H727, it is expressed at levels close to NET tissues. SSTR3 has moderate affinity for octreotide and other SSAs. It shows mRNA levels close to those of NET tissues in BON and H727, whereas the levels in the other cell lines were below the expression in normal tissues. SSTR1 was found to be highly expressed in UMC-11 (at the same level as in NET tissues), levels at or below normal tissues were detected in BON, LCC-18, and QGP-1. SSTR1 expression was lowest in H727. SSTR4 mRNA levels were similarly low in normal and NET tissues, and they could not be detected in any of the cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B).</p>
29681888	      <p>In summary, no octreotide binding was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A) in any of the cell lines and mRNA levels for the preferred target of octreotide, SSTR2, were found to be at least 10-fold and up to 1,000-fold lower in NET cell lines than in human NET tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Therefore, the lack of functional responses seen in viability, proliferation, and cell cycle analysis assays (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A–C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B) seemed likely to have its cause in low levels of SSTR2 expression in these cell lines. In order to rescue octreotide sensitivity, in two of the cell lines (BON, QGP-1) SSTR2 was reintroduced by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding human SSTR2. The success of SSTR2 re-expression was tested by RT-qPCR, radioligand binding assay, immunofluorescence, and internalization assay (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A–D). Quantification of human SSTR2 mRNA by RT-qPCR demonstrated successful expression of the target in both BON-SSTR2 and QGP-1-SSTR2 cells, with mRNA levels about 1,000-fold higher than in wild-type BON and QGP-1 and similar to mRNA levels found in human NET tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Consequently, considerably higher binding levels were detected in the [<sup>125</sup>I]-Tyr<sup>11</sup>-SST14 radioligand binding assay in transfected cells as compared to wild-type cells: 2.5-fold higher in BON-SSTR2 and 9-fold higher in QGP-1-SSTR2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Importantly, this binding could be completely displaced by increasing concentrations of unlabeled octreotide at IC<sub>50</sub> values in the expected subnanomolar to low nanomolar range (0.67 ± 0.32 nM for BON-SSTR2, 3.62 ± 0.23 nM for QGP-1-SSTR2). Similarly, immunofluorescence staining using a monoclonal antibody specific for human SSTR2 in wild-type BON and QGP-1 cells yielded only faint signals, whereas after reintroduction of SSTR2 into these cell lines, a clear staining signal was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). The distribution of SSTR2 staining suggested a predominant localization of the receptor at the plasma membrane. Taken together, SSTR2 detection in transfected cells using RT-qPCR, radioligand binding, and immunofluorescence staining strongly suggested successful SSTR2 reintroduction into BON and QGP-1 cells, thereby leading to sufficient levels of plasma membrane receptors. To verify whether these receptors would also show functional activity, a microscopic internalization assay was performed. BON-SSTR2 and QGP-1-SSTR2 were incubated for 30 min at 37°C under control conditions (medium only) or with 1 µM somatostatin-14 in medium. Controls showed predominantly plasma membrane localization as seen before, whereas after incubation with the agonist, a more diffuse, punctate pattern was observed, indicating a functional, ligand-dependent SSTR2 internalization into an intracellular vesicle compartment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). Similarly, cells were incubated with or without octreotide to principally demonstrate that there is downstream activity of octreotide in SSTR2-transfected BON and QGP-1 cells. As data in Figure S2 in Supplementary Material shows, octreotide has a profound effect on SSTR2 distribution in these cells (as well as in rat RIN-1038 cells transfected with a ratSSTR2-GFP plasmid). In the absence of ligand, the receptor localizes at the plasma membrane. Upon ligand addition, a translocation to an intracellular compartment becomes clearly visible (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material).</p>

29713661	      <p id="p0115">As outlined in the previous sections, there are multiple algorithmic options for reconstructing trajectories from single-cell data. We leave you with a few points of considerations when applying these methods.<list id="ulist0010" list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>•</label><p id="p0120">Many algorithms are developed by showing that existing algorithms do not perform well on a synthetic data set or a newly generated data set, thus motivating the development of a new algorithm. Overfitting is a point of consideration when the data set used for building the algorithm also is used to show its effectiveness. The effectiveness of the algorithm also should be shown on existing data sets that generated well-behaved results by previous algorithms.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>•</label><p id="p0125">Pseudotime currently has no real correspondence to real time. The number of cell states that recapitulates a trajectory can reflect the frequency of a transition event or the rate of transition. For instance, a longer branch can reflect a lineage that produces many cells compared with a shorter one.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>•</label><p id="p0130">The distribution of the input data matters. Tissue-level data sets, which are expected to contain multiple cellular phenotypes, usually are distributed with common and rare cell subsets. The power of droplet-based scRNA-seq approaches lies in their ability to query thousands of cells, and thus reduces the need for flow-sorting enrichment of rare cell populations for analysis. Uncommon cells can be extracted computationally after the data have been collected. However, results undoubtedly will be better analyzed for common cell types than rare ones. For instance, a 0.1% representation of a rare cell type even in a 4000-cell data set will be represented by only 4 data points in the data set. Although down-sampling and other strategies can be applied to normalize the distribution of data post hoc, a better strategy would be to tackle this issue during data collection. Enrichment experimental strategies for target populations, and/or methods to remove overly abundant or uninteresting cells may be considered depending on the biological question and the cell type of study.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>•</label><p id="p0135">All computational modeling approaches are hypothesis-generating tools that require assumptions to be fulfilled and results to be validated. For trajectory analysis algorithms, the key assumption is that transitioning cell states are represented within the collected data. Thus, whether tissue is being harvested during embryonic development vs adult will greatly affect the interpretation of results. For instance, pancreatic islet development is completed by embryonic day 16.5. Thus, an adult pancreatic data set collected at homeostasis will contain very few transitioning cells and will be unsuitable for trajectory analysis. Furthermore, results generated in silico should always be confirmed experimentally by methods such as conventional lineage tracing or lineage perturbation experiments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64"><sup>64</sup></xref> More recently, next-generation approaches that leverage mutational scars, such as those induced by Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, have been developed for accurately determining if individual cells belong to the same lineage in the classic, parent-child sense.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">82</xref> These approaches can potentially be integrated with single-cell approaches to combine cell-state transitional information with parent-child lineage data.</p></list-item></list></p>
30407529	      <p>A key challenge in bridging clinical and bioinformatics research is closing the gap between biobanks and public data archives. This would allow to provide traceability of samples, including the data that is generated from them, without compromising the anonymity of the patients who donated them. In a typical workflow, samples are physically obtained and stored by biobanks. Researchers can obtain patient samples from biobanks in order to conduct a variety of assays, before submitting their results to a public archive, which may be controlled access depending on the type of assay, as a prerequisite of publication. This data is then made available back to other researchers to subsequently exploit for further analysis. BioSamples accessions can provide this traceability, but to date a mechanism to enable biobanks to acquire BioSamples accessions and easily trace links to datasets has not existed. We now use Bioschemas, an extension to schema.org, that provides a mechanism to expose life science data in a structured form through the web without the need for a dedicated API. We have led the development of the samples specification for BioSchemas and are now exposing a Bioschemas compliant JSON-LD file for each of our samples, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples/SAMEA229810.ldjson">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/samples/SAMEA229810.ldjson</ext-link> in addition to a general <italic>DataCatalog</italic> description of the repository itself. By bridging between resources (biobanks, curated repositories such as the EGA and the BioSamples database), we enable the possibility of samples being traced back to their source, their combination behind firewalls with privately held genomic data, and the integration of results of other analyses on those same samples in a way that takes into account the need for controlled-access. BioSchemas also provides a mechanism to deliver lightweight metadata exchange pipelines. We earlier discussed the importance of high quality metadata in the metagenomics data. Marine microbial Reference genome database (MarRef) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) is a highly manually curated resource which ensures metagenomics samples have over 100 metadata attributes accurately described, many more than in a typical BioSamples database submission. In collaboration with MarRef, we are using BioSchemas to mark up additional curated metadata in a manner that the BioSamples database can automatically read, without the need for MarRef to implement a dedicated API. The BioSamples database is now able to incorporate this additional metadata into the original records using the curation object approach we have described above.</p>

Six days following mutagenesis, the HAP1-7TGP or LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cell populations were treated with a low dose (1.04%) of WNT3A CM in complete IMDM growth medium, combined with a saturating dose (10 ng/ml) of recombinant human RSPO1 (R and D Systems Cat. # 4645-RS) or RSPO3 (R and D Systems Cat. # 3500-RS), respectively. A total of 1.25 × 10<sup>8</sup> singlet-gated cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), gating for the lowest ~10% WNT reporter (EGFP) fluorescence. A population of singlet-gated HAP1-7TGP or LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells (not gated based on EGFP fluorescence) was also sorted and carried along as a control to set FACS gates during the subsequent sort. Cells were expanded for 6 days to allow recovery and resetting of the WNT reporter, and a portion of the cells was used in a subsequent round of sorting, following the same treatment and FACS gating criteria. For both screens described, cells underwent two consecutive rounds of FACS sorting. 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells expanded following the final sort for each screen were used to identify GT insertions in the sorted cell populations and an equivalent number of mutagenized but unsorted HAP1-7TGP or LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells were used to identify GT insertions in the respective control cell populations. Preparation of genomic GT insertion libraries for deep sequencing, mapping of sequencing reads and statistical analysis of GT insertion enrichment was conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lebensohn et al., 2016</xref>), except that the libraries for the unsorted (control) and sorted cell populations from the RSPO3 screen in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells were indexed and sequenced together in an Illumina NextSeq 500 system. FASTQ files containing sequencing data for the unsorted and sorted cell pupulations from the RSPO3 screen in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells, as well as for the sorted cell population from the RSPO1 screen in HAP1-7TGP cells have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with study accession number SRP260445. The FASTQ file containing the sequencing data for the unsorted cell pupulation from the RSPO1 screen in HAP1-7TGP cells had been deposited previously with study accession number SRP094861 (SRA accession number SRX2410629).

Preparation of genomic GT insertion libraries for deep sequencing, mapping of sequencing reads and statistical analysis of GT insertion enrichment was conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lebensohn et al., 2016</xref>), except that the libraries for the unsorted (control) and sorted cell populations from the RSPO3 screen in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells were indexed and sequenced together in an Illumina NextSeq 500 system. FASTQ files containing sequencing data for the unsorted and sorted cell pupulations from the RSPO3 screen in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells, as well as for the sorted cell population from the RSPO1 screen in HAP1-7TGP cells have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with study accession number SRP260445. The FASTQ file containing the sequencing data for the unsorted cell pupulation from the RSPO1 screen in HAP1-7TGP cells had been deposited previously with study accession number SRP094861 (SRA accession number SRX2410629). We generated a ranked list of hits from each screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and used it to create circle plots depicting the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Note that the data presented here for the RSPO1 screen in HAP1-7TGP cells is different from that presented in our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lebensohn et al., 2016</xref>) because in order to maintain a comparable degree of phenotypic enrichment between this screen and the RSPO3 screen in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells, we analyzed a cell population from our previous RSPO1 screen in HAP1-7TGP cells that had been sorted only twice (as opposed to four times) for the lowest ~10% WNT reporter activity.</p>

Only uniquely mapped reads were considered for further analysis. Aligned reads form biological replicates were pooled together. For LSD1 ChIP-seq analysis, tag directories were generated for pooled DMSO treated samples and for pooled GSK-LSD1-treated samples using HOMER v4.10.1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>), allowing a maximum of 1 tag per base pair to remove PCR duplicates and using the given fragment length. Peaks were called for pooled vehicle-treated samples and for pooled GSK-LSD1-treated samples using HOMER v4.10.1, using the corresponding inputs and default parameters. Visualization tracks were generated using HOMER v4.10.1, allowing a maximum of 1 tag per base pair to remove PCR duplicates, normalizing experiments to 10 millions total tags and subtracting the corresponding input (-tbp 1, -i -subtract) and visualized using UCSC Genome Browser(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kent et al., 2002</xref>). For the differential analysis of LSD1 peaks, DMSO-treated and GSK-LSD1-treated peak sets were concatenated, then sorted and merged using BEDtools v2.27.1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Quinlan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), allowing a maximum distance of 100 base pairs (bp) to merge peaks. The resulting peak file was gene annotated and reads were counted in each tag directories and normalized to fragments per kilobase mapped (FPKM) using HOMER v4.10.1. To retrieve high confidence peaks, the peak file was filtered to retrieve peaks with a read count greater than 2.5 FPKM in both condition (e.g., DMSO-treated or GSK-LSD1-treated). Differential peaks were defined as GSK-LSD1-lost if the read counts in DMSO-treated samples were at least 2 times higher than in GSK-LSD1-treated samples. Identically, peaks were defined as GSK-LSD1 gained if the read counts in GSK-LSD1-treated samples were at least 2 times higher than in DMSO-treated samples. Heatmaps and average profile plots were generated by annotating the corresponding peaks sets using HOMER v4.10.1 and custom R 34 scripts. Analysis of transcription factor motifs at each peak set was performed using HOMER v4.10.1 and a fragment size of 200 bp, scaling sequence logos by information content. Gene ontology analyses of DMSO / GSKLSD1-shared LSD1 sites, GSK-LSD1-lost LSD1 sites and GSK-LSD1-gained LSD1 sites were performed using HOMER gene ontology annotation, using the default genome size (2e9) and the default genome background. SNAI2 ChIPseq reads were retrieve form GEO GSE55421 and processed as described above, filtering out peaks with a FPKM lower than 2.5. Overlap between sets of LSD1 peaks and SNAI2 peaks was assessed by merging peak files, using HOMER v4.10.1, allowing a maximum merging distance of 1000 base pairs. For H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 ChIP-seq analysis, broad peaks were called in each condition on pooled biological replicates using macs2 - v2.1.1.20160309 using a broad-cutoff of 0.05 and default parameters(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Differential peaks were identified using macs2 bdgdiff default parameters.

Genomic distribution, average profile plots, heatmaps and visualization tracks of H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 in DMSO-treated samples and in GSK-LSD1-treated samples as well as differential H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 regions were retrieved by annotating the corresponding sets of peaks using HOMER v4.10.1, as described above. Overlaps between GSK-LSD1-gained H3K4me1, GSK-LSD1 gained H3K4me2 regions and GSKLSD1-lost LSD1 sites were assessed on peak-associated genes by associating those peaks with the nearest gene’s transcriptional start site using HOMER v4.10.1 and a custom R script.</p>

31420376	  <body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The intestinal mucosa are protected from luminal threats by epithelial cells overlaid with a layer of mucus that is structurally dependent on the polymeric protein Muc2. This protein is secreted by intestinal goblet cells and forms a barrier that separates the microbiota from the epithelial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johansson et al., 2008</xref>). Disruption of this barrier increases susceptibility to infectious pathogens and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergstrom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johansson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Desai et al., 2016</xref>) The structure and properties of the mucus layer vary depending on location along the gastrointestinal tract; in the distal colon, there is an inner mucus layer (IML) that is attached to the epithelial surface and is impenetrable to bacteria-sized objects. This defensive structure is necessitated by the vast number of bacteria that comprise the colonic microbiota. The distal colonic IML is converted to an unattached outer mucus layer that serves as a habitat and nutritional substrate for elements of the microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johansson et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Factors that can influence IML formation and function have been identified. Bacterial colonization appears to regulate formation of the IML as germ-free mice lack a functioning IML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johansson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Desai et al., 2016</xref>). The configuration of the microbiota also influences IML function, as genetically identical mice from different breeding colonies show microbiota-dependent IML variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jakobsson et al., 2015</xref>). Several endogenous factors that promote IML function have also been identified. These include the core O-glycan glycosyltransferases that sheath the Muc2 peptide backbone with a protective layer of glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergstrom et al., 2017</xref>), as well as goblet cell–secreted proteins (e.g., Zg16 and Relmβ) that protect the IML from infiltration by specific bacterial taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergström et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Propheter et al., 2017</xref>). However, despite recent advances in this area, our understanding of the mechanistic processes that regulate both the formation of the IML and its barrier capacity remains incomplete.</p><p>The proposed role of the microbiota in shaping the IML indicates that a promising area of IML regulatory research is the innate immune system, as this incorporates different signaling platforms that can detect multiple microbe-associated molecular patterns. One such platform is the inflammasome, a protein complex that links sensing of microbial molecules or cellular stress indicators by nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat–containing proteins (NLRs) to activation of the canonical and noncanonical effector proteases caspase 1 (Casp1) and Casp11. Inflammasomes are primarily studied in macrophages, where their assembly drives maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and pyroptosis; however, recent research has highlighted the defensive role of inflammasomal activity in the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knodler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birchenough et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In a recent investigation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wlodarska et al. (2014)</xref> examined the role of the Nlrp6 inflammasome during <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection and found that <italic>Nlrp6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Casp1/11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were more susceptible to infection. As the severity of <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection can be linked to IML function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergstrom et al., 2010</xref>), it was speculated that the Nlrp6 inflammasome might regulate the formation of the IML. By analyzing fixed colonic tissue sections, they found that <italic>Nlrp6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice lacked a detectable IML. This was phenocopied by <italic>Casp1/11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, thus suggesting that active epithelial Nlrp6 inflammasomes were critical regulators of Muc2 secretion, thereby controlling IML formation.</p><p>The results presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wlodarska et al. (2014)</xref> show clear differences between the mouse strains they examined; however, the reliance on histology to provide quantitative IML data are potentially problematic, as mucus preservation in tissue sections is highly variable. Additionally, use of nonlittermate-controlled mice means variations in the microbiota may also have led to the misinterpretation of genotype-independent IML phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stappenbeck and Virgin, 2016</xref>). This is relevant given the role of the microbiota in shaping the IML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jakobsson et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore sought to confirm the role of inflammasome signaling in controlling baseline IML formation using a range of different knockout mice and a combination of ex vivo and in vivo methods that can provide highly reproducible quantitative IML data. In addition, we have also applied these methods to littermate-controlled <italic>Nlrp6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals.</p><p>These investigations found that mice lacking Nlrp6, Casp1, or Casp11 formed an IML that was functionally indistinguishable from WT animals. Surprisingly, we did identify a dysfunctional IML phenotype in mice lacking the inflammasome substrate cytokine Il18; however, careful examination of this phenotype revealed it to be microbiota dependent and unlikely to be driven by Il18 deficiency. Our results therefore argue against the concept that Nlrp6 or inflammasome activity is involved in IML formation or function and further highlight the absolute requirement for microbiota-controlled experiments in this field.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Colonic goblet cell inflammasome expression</title><p>To explore the potential role of different inflammasomes in regulating mucus secretion and IML formation, we first examined the expression of inflammasome component genes in isolated distal colonic goblet cells. This was achieved by acquiring the total distal colonic epithelium from transgenic mice expressing mCherry-tagged MUC2 (RedMUC2<sup>98trTg</sup>) and sorting the goblet cell (mCherry<sup>+ve</sup>) and remaining epithelial cell (mCherry<sup>−ve</sup>) populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). RNA was extracted from each population and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Sorted cell population purity was assessed by examining transcripts coding for goblet cell–specific (<italic>Clca1</italic> and <italic>Tff3</italic>) and colonocyte-specific (<italic>Clca4a</italic> and <italic>Car1</italic>) genes, which demonstrated that the two major epithelial cell populations had been effectively separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Investigation of inflammasome expression in the goblet cell population detected transcripts encoding several putative or confirmed inflammasome activation sensors. Comparatively high expression of Aim2, Nlrc4, and Nlrp6 transcripts was detected. Nlrp1b, Nlrp9b, and Rig1 transcripts were also detected, albeit at lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Conversely, we detected negligible expression of Ifi204, Nlrp2, Nlrp3, Nlrp12, or Pyrin mRNA. Goblet cells also expressed transcripts for the conserved canonical inflammasome components Asc and Casp1, as well as Casp11. As inflammasome activity in other epithelial cells may influence goblet cell mucus secretion and IML formation, we also examined mRNA expression of inflammasome components in the mCherry<sup>−ve</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). With the exception of Nlrp9b, the mRNA expression pattern in this population was virtually identical to that observed in goblet cells. These results demonstrated that distal colonic goblet cells and other epithelial cells express transcripts encoding the essential components of several specific inflammasomes, all of which could therefore potentially play a role in distal colonic IML formation.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Inflammasome expression in the distal colonic epithelium.

In freshly isolated colonic tissue (in vivo sample), pro-Il18 was clearly detected; however, the bioactive form was virtually undetectable.

This indicated that bioactive Il18 could be generated by inflammasome-independent processing in colonic tissue under ex vivo conditions but that this active form was not normally present at detectable levels in the colonic tissue of mice housed in our facility.

Accordingly, we assessed microbiota α-diversity in our different mouse groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). We detected significantly lower diversity in separately housed <italic>Il18</italic><sup>−/−</sup> compared with WT mice, and this was normalized to WT levels by cohousing. However, diversity increased in <italic>Il18<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice after cohousing with both WT and WT2 mice, demonstrating that it did not covary with IML barrier function. To detect specific bacteria that covaried with IML phenotype, we subsequently employed linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), which identified 14 significant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with either the impenetrable (3 OTUs) or penetrable (11 OTUs) IML phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, E and F</xref>). Strikingly, these included the orders Bacteroidales and Clostridiales, which were associated with the impenetrable and penetrable IML phenotypes respectively and together accounted for ∼85% of bacteria detected in all samples, indicating that broad shifts in microbiota configuration correlated with IML barrier function.</p><p>We next sought to determine if the OTUs identified by LEfSe consistently cosegregated with IML phenotype in different experimental settings. This was achieved by examining shifts in abundance in mice where the IML phenotype switched between separately housed and cohoused mice from the same genetic background (i.e., WT mice before and after cohousing with <italic>Il18</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and <italic>Il18</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice before and after cohousing with WT2 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs. 6 G</xref> and S2 C). This analysis found that differences in all of the OTUs associated with the penetrable IML phenotype; e.g., the Clostridiales and the genus <italic>Akkermansia</italic> were primarily driven by changes in one, but not both, experimental groups. However, two of the OTUs associated with the impenetrable IML phenotype, the order Bacteroidales (&gt;99% composed of the family S24-7/Muribaculaceae in our data) and the genus <italic>Adlercreutzia</italic>, were consistent in their behavior across experimental groups in that they were both more abundant in mice with a functional IML but decreased when IML barrier function was compromised.</p><p>Finally, to contextualize our microbiota data, we compared it to previous findings comprising a limited number of earlier investigations have simultaneously measured IML properties and microbiota composition. We examined this pool of published datasets and identified bacterial taxons that were positively or negatively associated with IML thickness or barrier function (Fig. S3). Most bacterial taxon-IML associations were only represented by single observations or were found to be opposite in in different datasets; however, several taxons appeared to behave relatively consistently across different studies. Notably, both <italic>Adlercretuzia</italic> and the Muribaculaceae have been positively correlated to IML barrier function by several previous investigations, thus indicating that the abundance of these bacteria is associated with IML barrier function.</p><p>The fact that the microbiota both cosegregates with and alters the IML phenotype independently of the presence of Il18 indicates that the <italic>Il18<sup>−/−</sup></italic> phenotype is likely to be a genotype-independent false positive with respect to the detection of a dysfunctional IML barrier. However, detailed analysis of microbiota and IML cosegregation in these mice has allowed us to identify microbiota components that might be linked to modulation of IML barrier properties.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s08" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current investigation, we have applied combined ex vivo/in vivo IML analysis methods to multiple inflammasome knockout mice, including littermate-controlled <italic>Nlrp6<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, to verify the claim that Nlrp6 and inflammasome activity is required for IML formation and barrier function. Using this approach, we found no effect of Nlrp6 or inflammasome deficiency on IML thickness, barrier function, or mucus processing. These results conclusively argue against the concept that Nlrp6 regulates IML formation or function. Data acquired from other inflammasome knockout strains were not littermate controlled, raising the possibility that microbiota-dependent effects might influence our approach. Nonetheless, our data demonstrates that the IML is at minimum both present and functional in all inflammasome knockout strains examined. Consequently, while we cannot rule out minor effects, our data support the conclusion that the inflammasome has no major role to play in regulating the IML properties we have investigated.</p><p>An IML deficiency in <italic>Nlrp6<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, <italic>Asc<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Casp1/11<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice previously indicated that epithelial Nlrp6 inflammasome activity regulated goblet cell Muc2 secretion and IML formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wlodarska et al., 2014</xref>). This investigation was the first to provide compelling evidence of a link between innate immune signaling and the IML. However, a reliance on histology to quantitatively assess IML formation and comparison of nonlittermate WT and null mutant mouse colonies raised the possibility that these observations were driven by genotype-independent factors. Although histological staining of methanol-Carnoy–fixed tissue sections is the most commonly used method of IML assessment, it is highly susceptible to artifacts caused by IML shrinkage during fixation or damage during sectioning. Thus, while histology can provide indicative information regarding the IML, it is not always suitable for quantitative analysis and should be supported by other experimental approaches where possible. The IML is in direct contact with the colonic microbiota, and thus, its properties can be strongly influenced by microbiota configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jakobsson et al., 2015</xref>). Previous research investigating the same <italic>Nlrp6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse colony used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wlodarska et al. (2014)</xref> identified a dysbiotic microbiota that could colonize deep within the colonic crypts, indicating the presence of microbes with the capacity to disrupt or circumvent the IML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elinav et al., 2011</xref>). While the causal role of Nlrp6 in driving microbiota alterations is disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lemire et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mamantopoulos et al., 2017</xref>), it remains possible that the IML dysfunction in these mice is microbiota induced as opposed to directly caused by Nlrp6 deficiency. However, without closer investigation of the specific mice in question, we can only speculate as to the extent that these factors, or others, may be responsible for the discrepancy between our findings and those previously reported.</p><p>Screening inflammasome-related knockout mouse strains identified a dysfunctional IML in mice lacking the inflammasome substrate Il18. This proinflammatory cytokine is an important regulator of intestinal homeostasis (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maloy and Powrie, 2011</xref>), and a link to regulation of IML barrier function would therefore be of significance. We thus sought to determine the capacity of Il18 to regulate IML function but found no evidence of epithelial Il18 receptor complex expression or the presence of bioactive Il18 in freshly isolated colonic tissue from mice housed in our facility. Similar experiments in both mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wirtz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Arcangelis et al., 2017</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monteleone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pizarro et al., 1999</xref>) have also indicated that bioactive Il18 is not present in the healthy intestine. This observation was unexpected, given that the cytokine appears to control colonic microbiota composition via homeostatic regulation of antimicrobial peptide expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levy et al., 2015</xref>); however, it is possible that the activation state of Il18 under otherwise healthy conditions varies between WT mice housed at different locations. In addition, our results clearly show that ex vivo manipulation of intestinal tissue results in activation of Il18, a phenomenon that has been remarked upon by other investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>). This observation is consistent with Il18’s role as an alarmin-type cytokine that is activated in response to tissue damage. However, this activation sensitivity must be taken into account when designing experiments that assess the activation state of Il18 in vivo.</p><p>These observations argued against regulation of the IML by either direct Il18 signaling to the epithelium or indirect effects mediated by Il18-sensitive nonepithelial cells. The transfer or suppression of the dysfunctional IML phenotype observed in <italic>Il18<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice upon cohousing with WT mice clearly implicated a microbiota-dependent effect on the IML that was not dependent on the presence or absence of Il18. This was supported by microbiota analysis, which identified a clear correlation of a limited number of bacterial taxa with IML phenotype. Based on this evidence, it is likely that our <italic>Il18<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice have a microbiota configuration that negatively impacts on IML barrier function. While this finding is somewhat less significant than the invalidated concept that Il18 might regulate IML function, it does provide clear illustration of the capacity of the microbiota to affect the IML in a genotype-independent manner. Thus, it also serves as an excellent example of how even combined ex vivo/in vivo analysis methods may generate false–positive results in the absence of appropriate controls.</p><p>Previous investigations that have simultaneously examined IML barrier function and microbiota composition have found a number of significant correlations, primarily consisting of taxa that increase in abundance when the IML is dysfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chassaing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jakobsson et al., 2015</xref>). However, these have largely employed comparison of two groups in a confounding experimental setting (e.g., different diets), making it difficult to identify bacteria that might have a causal or consistent relationship with IML barrier function. Conversely, our study exploited three groups of mice with distinctive initial microbiota configurations and transmissible IML phenotypes that permitted identification of two bacterial taxa that consistently and positively correlated with IML function. Of these, the Bacteroidales, almost exclusively composed of the Muribaculaceae/S24-7 family, demonstrated the largest absolute change in abundance. However, the present lack of taxonomic resolution in this clade means we are currently unable to determine if these changes relate to specific subfamily taxonomic groups. The alterations in <italic>Adlercreutzia</italic> abundance were less dramatic, as they comprise &lt;0.5% of the total microbiota in most samples; however, as this genus is a known producer of at least one bioactive metabolite (equol), it has the potential to modulate host intestinal functions. Importantly, both Muribaculaceae/S24-7 and <italic>Adlercrutzia</italic> have been correlated with improved IML barrier function in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wlodarska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chassaing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schroeder et al., 2018</xref>), which reinforces their potential for future investigations seeking to identify bacteria that have a positive impact on the IML barrier. One drawback of the current study is that we have only analyzed the fecal microbiota. While this approach would have incorporated bacteria that are directly associated with the mucus layer, specific analysis of this community may have revealed microbiota alterations with a greater potential to modulate IML properties.</p><p>It is evident that specific inflammasomes are highly expressed by the major intestinal epithelial cell lineages. Current research largely supports a role for these signaling platforms as cytosolic sensors that detect microbial molecules during viral or bacterial intracellular infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knodler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Inflammasome activation during epithelial infection drives maturation of proinflammatory cytokines and pyroptotic expulsion of the infected cell, thereby maintaining epithelial integrity and alerting the immune system to the presence of microbial intruders. The suggestion that the Nlrp6 inflammasome regulated IML formation independently of cytokine maturation marked a significant departure from this pattern and suggested that active inflammasomes could have supplementary functions to the generation of proinflammatory signals. Indeed, our own research has found that the Nlrp6 inflammasome is an essential component of a signaling pathway that regulates compound Muc2 exocytosis in colonic senGCs after exposure to an abnormally high concentration of bacterial molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birchenough et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McGuckin and Hasnain, 2017</xref>). We have hypothesized that this mechanism acts as a defensive secretory response that is dormant under healthy conditions and independent of the Muc2 secretion that results in baseline IML formation. Consequently, while our previous work absolutely supports the fundamental concept posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wlodarska et al. (2014)</xref> that epithelial Nlrp6 inflammasome activity does have a novel role to play in regulating Muc2 secretion, this function is likely only active under certain circumstances. The results we have acquired during the present study do not support the hypothesis that inflammasome activity regulates normal IML formation.</p><p>In conclusion, this study illustrates how accurate analysis of IML properties requires the use of a combination of methods and comparison of tissues from microbiota-controlled animals. While our investigation does not support a role for the inflammasome in regulating IML formation, this does not mean that other innate immune signaling pathways have no role to play in this process. We therefore hope that this investigation will inform future research in this field and motivate investigation of alternate IML regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s09" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s10"><title>Animals</title><p>All WT, knockout, and transgenic mice were 6–14 wk old on the C57BL/6 background and bred in-house.

Sequences were clustered into OTUs at a 97% identity threshold using an open-reference OTU picking approach in QIIME 1 (version 1.9.1) with UCLUST against the Greengenes reference database (13_8 release). All sequences that failed to cluster when tested against the Greengenes database were used as input for picking OTUs de novo. Representative sequences for the OTUs were Greengenes reference sequences or cluster seeds and were taxonomically assigned using the Greengenes taxonomy and the Ribosomal Database Project Classifier. Representative OTUs were aligned using PyNAST and used to build a phylogenetic tree with FastTree. Chimeric sequences were identified with ChimeraSlayer and excluded from all downstream analyses. Similarly, sequences that could not be aligned with PyNAST, singletons, and very low-abundant sequence rRNA genes (relative abundance &lt;0.005%) were also excluded.

31350390	        <p id="Par8">Further in-depth characterisation of the markers defining different liver populations is required to fully understand their role in development and liver regeneration. Foetal hepatocytes and HHyPs demonstrate clear transcriptional distinction. Despite sharing <italic>ALB</italic> gene expression, foetal hepatocytes express none of the traditional progenitor/BEC markers enriched in HHyPs, including <italic>KRT7</italic>, <italic>SPP1</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic> and <italic>HNF1B</italic>. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Upon t-SNE analysis performed only on ALB<sup>+</sup> cells from our study, K-means clustering indicates that adult HHyPs are more closely associated with adult mature BECs then foetal HHyPs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). Studies have suggested uninjured adult liver would not contain progenitor-like cells with a hybrid hepatobiliary phenotype, yet our scRNA-seq analysis on uninjured human adult liver demonstrates HHyPs are both present and negative for many recently identified mature human BEC markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, despite the high transcriptional similarity between foetal and adult HHyPs there are some key differences in gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on foetal HHyP genes enriched over adult identifies ‘Stem cell proliferation’, ‘Developmental cell growth’, ‘Homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules’ and association with ‘Extracellular matrix component’, suggesting a phenotype associated with progenitor/stem cell-like function and important interactions with the niche environment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). Genes, including <italic>TACSTD2 (TROP-2)</italic>, <italic>CLDN4</italic>, <italic>CLDN10</italic> and <italic>KRT7</italic> are enriched in adult HHyPs compared to the foetal HHyP population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). In contrast, expression of <italic>CLDN6</italic> and the transcription factor <italic>STAT4</italic> are exclusively detected in foetal HHyPs. <italic>MCAM</italic>, <italic>CDH6</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic> are also enriched in foetal HHyPs over adult (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). We observed several other interesting gene expression patterns, including <italic>GPC3</italic> expressed exclusively in foetal parenchymal populations, <italic>CXCL2</italic> expressed exclusively in adult parenchymal populations and <italic>MUC1</italic> restricted to BECs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). To further understand how foetal HHyPs related to the current understanding of liver progenitor cells in the field, we looked at the transcriptome of a recent study for human primary hepatocyte-derived liver progenitor-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We identified that many of the top genes enriched in foetal HHyPs are enriched during the transition process from primary hepatocytes to progenitor-like cells, including <italic>MCAM</italic>, <italic>ANXA2</italic>, <italic>ANXA4</italic>, <italic>BICC1</italic>, <italic>SPIN1</italic>, <italic>TNFRSF12A</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic> and <italic>ABCC3</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). This suggests that in vitro reprogramming techniques to create progenitor-like cells from mature hepatocytes are moving towards a foetal HHyP-like phenotype.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of foetal hepatic and HHyP scRNA-seq populations.

32958515	        <p>Signalling molecules comprising (transcription) regulatory feedback loops present promising drug targets because they can influence the dynamics of a signalling pathway of interest, including the TNF/NF-κB pathway. To augment existing knowledge about NF-κB signalling, we developed an analysis workflow to identify genes encoding potential components of transcription regulatory feedback loops combining known NF-κB-involving signalling pathways, ChIP-seq assay-based NF-κB/RelA-bound genomic regions from the ENCODE project [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) series <uri ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE31477">GSE31477</uri>], and a newly developed method to find combinations of enriched DNA sequence motifs [motif enrichment analysis by logistic regression (MEALR)] (see Materials and Methods for details). Combinations of prioritised motifs tend to coincide with transcription factors that are known to cooperate. Our analysis found 24 transcription factors that appear to cooperate in NF-κB signalling within the genomic regions reported by ENCODE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="DMM044040TB1">Table 1</xref>) as well as 90 potential NF-κB/RelA-target genes that encode components of known pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="DMM044040TB2">Table 2</xref>).

32958515	        <p>We applied MEALR to reveal discriminative DNA sequence motifs in genomic regions bound by NF-κB/RelA after TNF stimulus. Sequence scores were calculated for a subset from the TRANSFAC(R) database, release 2014.4, consisting of 1429 motifs for transcription factors from vertebrate organisms. Genomic NF-κB/RelA binding sites were identified by analysis of ChIP-seq experiments carried out by the ENCODE project and deposited in GEO [Gm10847, Gm12878, Gm12891, Gm12892, Gm15510, Gm18505, Gm18526, Gm18951, Gm19099, and Gm19193 (GEO series <uri ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE31477">GSE31477</uri>)]. MEALR models were estimated to distinguish ChIP-seq peak sequences from genomic background sequences that were randomly sampled from gene promoter regions not overlapping with peaks of the respective experiment. The analysis was conducted five times for each ChIP-seq data set with different background sequence sets. We retained motifs that were incorporated in the model in all five runs.

Altogether, we compared gene expression matrices of 6,187 human ileum cells in this study to the 3,927 mouse ileum cells, which were subjected to the same process of quality control and filtering. We only considered the homologous genes between human and mouse, which eventually generated a scaled expression matric for 11,157 genes of 10,114 cells. For each pair of cells from human and mouse, the Pearson correlation was calculated with the scaled expression data of the genes in the two cells.</p>

32966340	        <p>To gain molecular insights into early cellular changes associated with alcohol exposure in an unbiased manner, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of monolayer EPC1, EPC2 and EPC3 cells treated with or without 0.1% or 2% EtOH for 8 h. We chose an 8 h time point because the majority of cells (&gt;70%) were deemed viable in monolayer culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). RNA-seq yielded 32 million input reads per sample of which 24 million were uniquely mapped on average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239625.s010">S1 Table</xref>). 0.1% EtOH had minimal impact upon gene expression (q&lt;0.01) as visualized by principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239625.s004">S4 Fig</xref>); however, 2% EtOH induced significant changes in 6985 genes with 3370 upregulated and 3615 downregulated (GSE143479). Canonical pathway analysis suggested downregulation of the TCA cycle as the foremost change induced by EtOH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), indicating that EtOH exposure may lead to decreased mitochondrial metabolism. In agreement, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that those associated with mitochondrial structural and functional components including oxidative phosphorylation may be amongst the most negatively enriched sets of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239625.s011">S2 Table</xref>). Additionally, EtOH downregulated significantly genes essential in cell-cycle regulation and DNA damage response pathways (ATM signaling and nucleotide excision repair) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To investigate whether mitochondrial dysfunction may be induced by EtOH, we focused on EPC1 and EPC2 cells in further experiments because they were more similar in gene expression profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239625.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) and EtOH sensitivity (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g002">2</xref>) than EPC3.</p>
32966340	        <p>We explored pathways that may account for the gene expression changes observed under EtOH-induced stress. We utilized the IPA software to analyze our RNA-seq data (GSE143479, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g003">Fig 3</xref>) for the cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators. The mTOR and its network, which negatively regulates autophagy and induces several anabolic pathways, was suggested to be suppressed in EtOH-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>). To confirm the downregulation of this pathway following EtOH exposure, we performed immunoblotting for mTORC1 targets. Following EtOH exposure, we observed robust inhibition of phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target S6 in both EPC1 and EPC2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g009">Fig 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239625.s006">S6C Fig</xref>), as well as decreased phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target 4EBP-1 in EPC2, but little if any in EPC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239625.g009">Fig 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239625.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). This likely reflects some differences in the mTORC1 downstream pathways between the two cell lines.</p>
32153125	        <p>LS174T cells (ATCC: CL‐188; 7 000 3535) (Synthego Corporation, Redwood City, CA) were the parental cells used to generate pooled clones of PXR‐knockout. CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated knockout cells were generated by Synthego Corporation (Redwood City, CA, USA). Briefly, cells were first tested negative for mycoplasma. Guide RNA was selected for high activity, specificity, and activity to create premature stop codons through frameshift mutations in the coding region via insertions and/or deletions (Indels) within exon 2 of the gene encoding human <italic>PXR</italic> (<italic>NR1I2</italic> transcript ID ENST00000337940). To generate specific guide RNAs, based on off‐target analysis, the following modified RNAs were selected: <italic>NR1I2‐119,807,249 5′ AAGAGGCCCAGAAGCAAACC‐3′ [TGG]‐PAM</italic>. To generate these cells, ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) containing the Cas9 protein and synthetic chemically modified sgRNA (Synthego) were electroporated into the cells using Synthego's optimized protocol. Editing efficiency is assessed upon recovery, 48 h post‐electroporation. Genomic DNA is extracted from a portion of the cells, PCR‐amplified, and sequenced using Sanger sequencing. The resulting chromatograms are processed using Synthego Inference of CRISPR Edits software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://ice.synthego.com">ice.synthego.com</ext-link>).

33232663	          <p id="p0410">We used an existing RNA-seq dataset generated using RNAi-mediated knockdown of AR (SRR7120653, SRR7120649, SRR7120646, and SRR7120642). We downloaded raw fastq files and aligned them to the transcriptome (gencode.v28) using Salmon (v0.14.1 using–validateMappings and -l ISR flags). We then used DESeq2 (1.22.2) to compare gene expression changes in response to AR knockdown. We then used the AR-bound gene-set from the previous step to assess how the AR targets respond to its downregulation. For this, we used our iPAGE tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodarzi et al., 2009</xref>) which uses mutual information (MI) and an associated <italic>z</italic>-score to assess the enrichment/depletion patterns of a gene-set across gene expression modulations. To visualize this data, we included a volcano plot, with genes of interest shown in red. For this analysis, we divided log-fold changes into nine equally populated bins, which were also included along with the patterns of enrichment and depletion across the data.</p>

Reduced goblet cell numbers (AB-PAS) were observed in <italic>Mtg16−/−</italic> adult intestine (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="appsec1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). This is in concordance with the previously reported phenotype of <italic>Mtg16 null</italic> animals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26"><sup>26</sup></xref> Similarly, there was a tendency toward reduction of enterocyte markers (villin and alkaline phosphatase) in the mutant intestines (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="appsec1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). We believe that the moderate alteration of terminal differentiation might be due to the redundant role of Mtg8.

Of note, RNA-seq data did not reveal significant alteration of goblet cell markers.

The hairpin sequences against ZNF417/587 were designed using the Genetic Perturbation Portal of the Broad Institute and inserted with Age I/Eco RI into pLKO.1.puro LV (TRCN0000018002; Sigma-Aldrich). After assessing the efficiency of various hairpins for depleting the two KZFPs, the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the sequence GCAGCATATTGGAGAGAAATT was used alone in all experiments except for the RNA-seq in H1 hESC, where it was combined with one targeting AGTCGAAAGAGCAGCCTTATT in two of the four replicates. The pLKO.shDnmt3A/3B vectors were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). The pLKO.shLuc and pLKO empty vectors served as controls. KD efficiency was verified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) after puromycin selection and at the time of sample collection for each experiment. LV containing Cas9KRAB and LTR5hs/SVAs single-guide RNA (ACCCCGTGCTCTCTGAAACAC) was designed and validated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>) using a Cas9KRAB-expressing empty backbone as control. The ZNF417-HA and ZNF587-HA coding sequences from the previously described pTRE vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>) were swapped with the GFP cassette of the pRRL.PGK.GFP LV (plasmid #12252; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.addgene.org/">http://www.addgene.org/</ext-link>) to generate KZFP-overexpressing vectors used in stem cells. LV production and titration protocols are detailed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://tronolab.epfl.ch">http://tronolab.epfl.ch</ext-link>, and lentiviral packaging plasmids are available at Addgene (plasmids #12260 and #12259). Viral titers were determined on HCT116, and an equivalent number of transducing units were used for all vectors in each experiment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>NCCIT cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× GlutaMAX, 1× non-essential amino acids, and 1× antibiotics. Murine J1 ESCs stably transduced with the various LV-HERVK vectors were grown on gelatin, split with Accutase, maintained in 2i + LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) medium, and transduced with the doxycycline-inducible pTRE-ZNF LVs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 60. hiPSC and H1 hESC (WA01, WiCell) were maintained on hESC-qualified Matrigel (BD Biosciences) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>) and as approved by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and the Canton of Vaud Ethics committee. Stem cells were transduced at an MOI of 4, 15, or 100 for KD, CRISPRi, or overexpression experiments, respectively, and selected with puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) for 3 days for KD and CRISPRi. Puromycin-selected hiPSCs were differentiated in induced neurons by addition of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) for 4 days to induce expression of the exogenous neurogenins as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). Lyophilized STINGi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>) was freshly reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide, added to hiPSCs at 0.5 μM 45 min before transduction with KD LVs, and replaced each day.</p><p>Brain organoids were differentiated from H1 ESCs transduced at the same MOI in different wells but, in parallel, with LVs expressing either the shZNF or the empty control vector. Three additional control wells were processed at the same time—one receiving an LV expressing a sh targeting a non–TE binding ZNF, one an irrelevant sh specific for luciferase, and one was not transduced—to control for normal macroscopic development of ZNF417/ZNF587 wild-type (WT) organoids. Cells transduced with the various LVs were puromycin-selected for 3 days, and 9000 of the puromycin-selected cells from each condition were seeded into 96-well low-binding plate to begin organoid generation using the STEMdiff Cerebral Organoid Kit (#08570, STEMCELL Technologies) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Day 0 is denoting the transfer of H1 hESC to a 96-well plate for differentiation into embryoid bodies. Sample size was monitored at three different time points along differentiation (days 20, 33, and 43), and immunostaining and RNA-seq were performed with day 20 organoids, with KD and control organoids always treated in parallel and collected at the same time for downstream analyses.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Protein analyses</title><p>Proteins were extracted from pTRE plasmid-transfected 293T cells in 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC) and immunoprecipitated with either mouse immunoglobulin GM (IgGM) (#I5381, Sigma-Aldrich) or anti KAP1 (#MAB3662, Millipore) antibodies. Immunoprecipitated material was loaded onto 4 to 20% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to membranes for probing with anti-HA-Horseradish peroxidase conjugated (anti–HA)-HRPO (#12013819001, Roche) and rabbit anti-RBCC (#ab10483, Abcam).

RNA-seq was performed with triplicates of day 20 organoids derived in parallel from the shZNF417/587 or the nonrelevant shLuc recipient H1 hESC. Total RNA was extracted with either the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche), NucleoSpin RNA XS (Macherey-Nagel), or RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) with an on-column deoxyribonuclease treatment. For RNA-seq, sample libraries were prepared using a TruSeq stranded mRNA sample preparation kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq machine with stranded 75–base single or paired-end reads for the CRISPRi and ZNF KD or STINGi-related RNA-seqs, respectively. All RT-qPCRs were performed with RNAs from at least independent biological duplicates, using random hexamers and SuperScript II (Invitrogen) or Maxima H Minus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate complementary DNAs (cDNAs). Each cDNA was quantified in triplicates with SYBR Green Mix (Applied Biosystems). The −ΔΔ<italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub> method was used to calculate fold change.

S4A were downloaded from GSE60548. For the BrainSpan Atlas and GTEx RNA-seq remapping, raw SRA (Sequence Read Archive) files were downloaded from the dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) data portal using the prefetch tool from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) SRA Toolkit v2.9.2 and then converted to FASTQ using the fastq-dump tool (with –split-3 for paired-end data). Reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using HISAT2 (v2.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>) with default parameters. Gene counts were generated using uniquely mapped reads with HTSeq-count (for KD hESC RNA-seqs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>) or featureCounts (iPS/iN and CRISPRi RNA-seqs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>). TE counts were generated using the uniquely mapped reads using the multiBamCov tool from the BEDTools software (for KD hESC RNA-seqs) and featureCounts for all others. To avoid read assignation ambiguity between genes and TEs, a gtf file combining both features was provided to featureCounts. TE reads in exons were always dismissed. Genes and TEs with low counts (less reads than there are samples) were discarded. Normalization for sequencing depth was done for both genes and TEs using the Trimmed Mean of -values (TMM) method as implemented in the limma package of Bioconductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>) and using the counts on genes as library size. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using Voom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>) as it has been implemented in the limma package of Bioconductor. A moderated <italic>t</italic> test (as implemented in the limma package of R) was used to test significance. <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg’s method. A gene (or TE) was considered to be DE when the absolute fold change between groups was bigger than 2 and the FDR (adjusted <italic>P</italic> value) was smaller than 0.05 (***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, and *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

Starting from each annotated ERV-int element, we first computed a frequency table of the surrounding retroelement fragments. We then computed the frequency distributions of each LTR type for each ERV-int subfamily and performed a Wald test to assign a <italic>P</italic> value to each LTR/ERV-int pair. To merge an LTR to an ERV-int fragment, it had to represent more than 2% of the pairs, the <italic>P</italic> value had to be smaller than 0.001, the two elements had to be in the same orientation, and the distance between the two elements had to be shorter than 100 bp. The name of the internal part was given to the resulting LTR/ERV-int merged element. For example, an element resulting from LTR7 and HERVH-int fragment merging is identified as HERVH-int. Relevance of LTR and internal piece merging was verified when possible in the literature and in the Dfam database of repetitive DNA based on profile hidden Markov models (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://dfam.org">dfam.org</ext-link>). Fragmented ERV-int or fragmented LTRs from the same subfamily (same name in Repbase database) with the same orientation and closer than 100 bp were also merged.</p><p>We used RNA-seqs with a depth superior to 30 to 40 million reads and at least 75 bp in length as we determined, by comparing various RNA-seq approaches for their respective yield in mappable TE transcripts, that it allowed us to assign more than 91% of repeat-derived reads to specific unique genomic loci through our TE-optimized analytical pipeline.</p><p>TE age was estimated by measuring substitution density of TE loci by comparison with their respective subfamily consensus. Substitutions were then separated between transitions and transversions to feed a Kimura two-parameter model (in-house script) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><italic>43</italic></xref>). To estimate an evolutionary age from Kimura substitution levels, we assumed a constant rate of substitution per million years of 2.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44"><italic>44</italic></xref>), which allowed us to obtain divergence time in million years for each TE locus.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing</title><p>KAP1 ChIP-seq has been described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>).

Cells were fixed with methanol-free formaldehyde (333 mM final) for 10 min at room temperature, diluted with tris (pH 8) (200 mM final), and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and pellets were frozen at −80°C. Cross-linked cells were incubated for 10 min at 4°C in buffer I [50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, and 0.25% Tx100, supplemented with protease inhibitors], spinned, incubated for 10 min at 4°C in buffer II [10 mM tris (pH 8), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitors], spinned, washed three times at 4°C in buffer III [buffer II supplemented with 0.1% NaDOC and 0.25% N-Lauroylsarcosine sodium salt (NLS)], and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer III before being transferred to a TC12X12 AFA fiber tube (Covaris). Sonication was performed with an automated Covaris Focused-ultrasonicator with the following parameters: 20 min, 5% duty cycle, 140 W, and 200 cycles, and extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C. Chromatin sonication was evaluated on a Bioanalyzer DNA chip (Agilent) with one aliquot of material treated with ribonuclease A overnight at 65°C and purified with Qiagen MinElute columns. Immunoprecipitations were performed in low DNA binding tubes using Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after a preclearing step for histone ChIPs and as recommended by the manufacturer. Antibodies specific for HA (#901503, BioLegend), H3K9me3 (#C15410056, Diagenode), H3K4me1 (#pAb-037-050, Diagenode), and H3K27ac (#ab4729, Abcam) were used. Immunoprecipitated material was eluted and treated with proteinase K overnight at 65°C in EB (TE 1× and 1% SDS) and purified on Qiagen MinElute columns. Total inputs and chromatin immunoprecipitated samples were prepared for libraries using 10 ng of material. Aliquots of the samples were tested in qPCR using the KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, KK4604) to determine the optimal number of PCR cycles needed to amplify each library without reaching saturation. Libraries were amplified with KAPA HiFi HotStart Readymix polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, KK2602), size-selected using Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), and always quality-checked on a Bioanalyzer DNA high sensitivity chip (Agilent) and quantified with a Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer, Invitrogen).

Only reads with a mapping quality score higher than 10 were retained. Before peak calling, BAM files were filtered removing reads aligning to ENCODE blacklist regions and to regions of ChIP experiments with high signal in the input using the Bioconductor package GreyListChIP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/GreyListChIP">https://bioconductor.org/packages/GreyListChIP</ext-link>).

Fluorescence imaging was performed with a Leica DM5500 microscope or a Leica SP8 microscope. For wide-field organoid images, a Leica stereoscope was used and the outer area of individual organoids was measured with FIJI using automatic thresholding. To determine the contribution of immature neuroectoderm or rosette-like structures to organoids, FIJI was used with the following criteria. Neuroectodermal-like regions with continual PAX6-positive staining were manually drawn around, and rosette-like structures were determined via the presence of an obvious lumen, flanked by cells of apical basal polarity. The percentage overall contribution of both structures was measured as a proportion of the whole organoid, excluding any large internal cavities. Quantification of Ki67-positive cells was performed with FIJI. Channels were split and converted to 8-bit images and an intensity threshold of 160, and “watershed” was applied to separate touching cells. The tool “Analyze Particles” was used with “show outlines” to demarcate and record the number of Ki67-positive cells. To obtain representative cell counts throughout the organoids, this was repeated on three serial sections separated by approximately 80 to 100 μm, resulting in an average number of Ki67-positive cells per organoid.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Allen brain transcriptome mapping</title><p>Only uniquely mapped reads and TEs with more than 50 reads were retained for analysis.

31503404	        <p>Lukovac et al<xref ref-type="ref" rid="jdb12986-bib-0027">27</xref> established a murine intestinal epithelial organoid model and explored the transcriptional response upon exposure to the supernatant of <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> or <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic>. We carried out a bioinformatic analysis of their microarray data (GSE59644). Our results implied that the most significant transcriptional response upon exposure to <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> supernatant was cell adhesion (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="jdb12986-supitem-0001">S1</xref>A). Cell adhesion consists of the interaction between cell‐adhesion molecules and cell junction structures. The KEGG analysis suggested one of the signaling pathways that <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> supernatant potentially modulates is tight junctions (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="jdb12986-supitem-0001">S1</xref>B). Our bioinformatic analysis indicated that metabolites from <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> potentially regulate the intestinal barrier. The depletion of <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> might critically alter the intestinal barrier in DM.</p>

33188777	          <p id="p0420">The number of translating vRNAs per cell was determined manually for each time point, starting from the first time point that a translating vRNA could be observed, until either individual vRNAs could no longer be distinguished anymore due to the large number of vRNAs in the cell or until the number of translating vRNAs exceeded 50 vRNAs/cell. All bright GFP spots were considered individual translating vRNAs. However, the following additional criteria were taken into account during counting of translating vRNAs:<list id="olist0015" list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0030"><label>1)</label><p id="p0425">Translating vRNAs are highly mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1</xref>M) and a single vRNAs can therefore often be observed in multiple slices of a Z stack at different x,y coordinates, resulting in two spots close together in the maximal intensity projection. To prevent double counting of the same translating vRNA in the maximal projection, two spots positioned very close together were counted as a single translating vRNA.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0035"><label>2)</label><p id="p0430">In many STAb-expressing cells, we also observed one or two distinct GFP foci adjacent to the nucleus, most likely indicating that the STAb bound with weak affinity to the centrosomes. These foci were independent of virus infection, as similar foci could also be observed in uninfected cells. These foci were excluded from all analyses.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0040"><label>3)</label><p id="p0435">Some cells contain GFP foci that were larger and far less mobile than translating vRNAs. These foci were observed in both infected and uninfected cells, and thus represent background foci. These background foci often co-localized with mCherry positive foci, indicative of autofluorescence. A combination of morphology, mobility, and dual positivity with mCherry was used to exclude these background foci during counting of translating vRNAs.</p></list-item></list>
33188777	            <p id="p0455">Since a small amount of noise (i.e., variations in the number of detected foci between adjacent time-points) was observed in the calling of the number of translating vRNAs per time-point (likely due to imperfect detection of vRNAs), the following additional criteria were taken into account for phase annotation:<list id="olist0020" list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0045"><label>1)</label><p id="p0460">Phase1, phase1 pulses, phase1 breaks, and phase2 were each called only if their duration was at least 12.5 minutes. Depending on the timing interval, 3-12 consecutive time points are needed to fulfill the 12.5 minutes requirement. A gap in phase 1 (i.e., one or multiple consecutive time-points without detection of a translating vRNA) could be the result of noise in counting of translating vRNAs or a phase1 break. To test whether a 12.5 minutes threshold is sufficient to distinguish ‘counting noise’ from true biological changes in the infection phase, we analyzed the frequency and the number of consecutive time-points without a translating vRNA during phase1. For each cell, the frequency and duration of gaps of less than 12.5 minutes was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3</xref>E). The majority of gaps consisted of a single time-point, indicating noise in translating vRNA counting. Gaps of 12.5 minutes or longer due to noise would not be expected based on the distributions of gap duration, but instead reflect a biological change in the number of GFP foci. A threshold of 12.5 minutes can thus be used to adequately annotate phase1, phase2, phase1 pulses, and phase1 breaks.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0050"><label>2)</label><p id="p0465">A moving average of the number of translating vRNAs over time was used to approximate both the end of phase3 and the start of phase5.

33228475	        <p>The coronavirus disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global health crisis that is being endured with an increased alarm of transmission each day. Though the pandemic has activated innumerable research attention to decipher an antidote, fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms is necessary to halt the disease progression. The study focused on comparison of the COVID-19 infected lung tissue gene expression datasets -GSE155241 and GSE150316 with the GEO2R-limma package. The significant up- and downregulated genes were annotated. Further evaluation of the enriched pathways, transcription factors, kinases, noncoding RNAs and drug perturbations revealed the significant molecular mechanisms of the host response. The results revealed a surge in mitochondrial respiration, cytokines, neurodegenerative mechanisms and deprived oxygen, iron, copper, and glucose transport. Hijack of ubiquitination by SARS-CoV-2, hox gene differentiation, histone modification, and miRNA biogenesis were the notable molecular mechanisms inferred. Long non-coding RNAs such as C058791.1, TTTY15 and TPTEP1 were predicted to be efficient in regulating the disease mechanisms. Drugs-F-1566-0341, Digoxin, Proscillaridin and Linifanib that reverse the gene expression signatures were predicted from drug perturbations analysis. The binding efficiency and interaction of proscillaridin and digoxin as obtained from the molecular docking studies confirmed their therapeutic potential. Two overlapping upregulated genes MDH1, SGCE and one downregulated gene PFKFB3 were appraised as potential biomarkers candidates. The upregulation of PGM5, ISLR and ANK2 as measured from their expressions in normal lungs affirmed their possible prognostic biomarker competence. The study explored significant insights for better diagnosis, and therapeutic options for COVID-19.</p>
33228475	      <p>The present study focused on statistically synchronized in silico methods to identify the differential gene expression studies of two datasets of Gene expression omnibus, GSE150316 and GSE155241. The datasets contained high throughput RNA sequencing data from the autopsy of various organs of patients succumbed to COVID-19. In order to eliminate poor reproducibility, intensive attention was given only on the lung tissues from both healthy and diseased samples which evaluated the differential expression of genes. Varied Integrated approaches applied in this study computed the enrichment of functions, pathways and non-coding RNAs which gained insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis. The assessment of protein–protein interactions performed augmented the hub genes and their respective association. Potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers were confirmed from the overlapping genes of the disastrous pandemic COVID-19 which can be developed into further treatment and therapeutic options.</p>
33228475	        <p>The gene expression datasets of COVID-19 were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) with the accessions GSE150316 (Desai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">2020</xref>) and GSE155241 (Han et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">2020</xref>). The datasets housed multiple samples and we chose only the lung tissues for our study. The platforms for GSE150316 was based on GPL15520 Illumina Miseq (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) and had 88 samples of various tissues. Among them 5 control and 16 lung tissue samples affected with COVID-19 were chosen. GSE155241 was based on the platform GPL24676 Illumina Novaseq6000 (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>) with 18 samples of lung autopsy tissues and organoids. Three samples each from healthy lung, COVID-19 affected lung autopsy tissues, mock control hpsc (human pluripotent stem cell) derived lung organoid and COVID-19 infected hpsc lung organoid samples were analysed in our study. Both the datasets were standardised, log transformed and scrutinised for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the GEO2R module of Limma package of R. Statistics of Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (Dubitzky et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">2013</xref>) was applied with log2FC &gt;0.5 (Perez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0051">2019</xref>) and <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 thresholds (Stephens et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0061">2019</xref>) to screen the significant genes. Heat maps of top 100 genes clustered with K-means and volcano plots representing the up- and downregulated DEGs were plotted using the bioinfokit module of python (Bedre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">2020</xref>). Venn diagrams were useful to determine the mutually regulated genes and the overlapping DEGs of both the datasets were identified using the Venny tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/</ext-link>).</p>
33228475	        <p>The raw data of GSE150316 and GSE155241 were downloaded from the GEOdatabase where the samples of lung were retained and the remaining tissues from both datasets were discarded for better comparison and reproducibility. The analysis was on 5 healthy controls, 16 samples of COVID-affected lung autopsy tissues from GSE150316. Tissues of healthy lung, COVID-19 affected lung autopsy tissues, mock control hpsc lung organoid and COVID-19-infected hpsc lung organoid samples (3 each) from GSE155241 were analysed. The selected sample sets were standardised and analysed with the GEO2R package to obtain DEGs with the threshold of <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.05 and log2FC &gt;0.5. There were 51 up- and 57 downregulated DEGs obtained from GSE155241. A total of 620 upregulated and 594 downregulated DEGs acquired from GSE150316. Further a total of six upregulated and eight downregulated DEGs were identified that were mutual to both the datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(A,B)</xref>). Volcano plots representing the up- and downregulated DEGs are shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(C,D)</xref>. For effective visualization, top 100 DEGs ranked based on their <italic>p</italic> values were clustered in a heatmap based on K-means clustering algorithm. Heatmaps of the top 100 DEGs of dataset GSE155241 and GSE150316 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(E,F)</xref>, respectively. The overlapping upregulated genes were identified as AMZ2, MDH1, TMEM261, PHF14, PTGFRN and SGCE. The overlapping down regulated genes were UGCG, DUSP6, TIPARP, NUPL1, NOLC1, PFKFB3, ERRFI1 and SLC19A2.</p>

33228475	      <p>COVID-19 is a rapidly disseminated pandemic that has spread to 216 countries globally within a very short span since its origin in December 2019. Treatment has become more challenging due to rapid transmission and severe progression of the disease (Kumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">2020b</xref>). Even with the fast paced continuous scientific research, on development of vaccines, repurposed drugs and diagnosis techniques, there is a lack of significant treatment options. The current study was conducted with a specific focus on human responses to enumerate multifactorial approaches that are involved in pathogenesis and control of COVID-19 (Kumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">2020c</xref>). With an aim to identify candidate gene biomarkers, two transcriptome data sets GSE155241 and GSE150316 were analysed and compared. Subsequently integrated Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the molecular mechanisms, ceRNA networks and chemical perturbagens to aid in the better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Analysis of GSE155241 attained 51 and 57 up- and downregulated genes whereas, the dataset of GSE150316 revealed 620 and 524 up- and downregulated genes, respectively. Significant upregulated overlapping genes of the two datasets were identified as AMZ2 (Archaelysin Family Metallopeptidase 2), MDH1 (Malate Dehydrogenase 1), TMEM261 (Transmembrane protein 261), PHF14 (PHD finger protein 14), PTGFRN (Prostaglandin F2 receptor inhibitor), and SGCE (Sarcoglycan epsilon). Eight overlapping genes -UGCG (UDP-Glucose Ceramide Glucosyltransferase), DUSP6 (Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6), TIPARP (TCDD Inducible Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase), NUPL1 (Nucleoporin 58), NOLC1 (Nucleolar And Coiled-Body Phosphoprotein 1), PFKFB3 (6-Phosphofructo-2-Kinase/Fructose-2,6-Bisphosphatase 3), ERRFI1 (ERBB Receptor Feedback Inhibitor 1), SLC19A2 (Solute Carrier Family 19 Member 2) were significantly downregulated.</p>
33228475	      <p>The contributors of the dataset GSE150316, reported temporal spatial heterogeneity analysis of host response to SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection. As per their results, there was a surge in immune responses especially interferon pathways, JAK STAT pathway, collagen synthesis and antiviral genes. The study also confirmed the heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with viral load and interferon pathways in multiple organs (Desai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">2020</xref>). The second dataset GSE155241 was established from RNA sequences from lung biopsy tissues and organoid models acquired from human pluripotent stem cells. The study reported that Proximal airway cells are critical for viral infectivity and distal alveolar cells for emulating host response along with twenty predominant genes involved in severity of the disease (Han et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">2020</xref><bold>)</bold>. Though both the studies suggest ample clinical evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, current comparative transcriptome analysis that deduce differential gene expression would enumerate and augment both diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy. This study strongly supports the clinical findings of the contributors Desai et al. and Han et al. and extends additional evidence of molecular mechanisms such as increase in mitochondrial respiration, endopeptidase activity, ubiquinone activity, complement activation, neutrophil degranulation and tau protein binding. There was a predominant impairment related to the transport mechanism of copper, iron, zinc, cobalt, cadmium, and manganese. It is evident that there is a serious downregulation of GTPase activators, protein tyrosine phosphatase, response to cytokines, interleukins, MAP kinase activity along with transporters like azole and carboxylic acid trans membrane transporters. Cellular components like dystrophin associated glycoprotein complex, dendrites, platelet alpha granular lumen were relatively found to be more when compared with lysosomes, golgi and nucleolus. Immense amount of functional non coding RNAs (LINC00493) and small RNAs (SNORD variants) were expressed across the tissue samples whose functions are yet to be understood. The overexpression of LINC00493 is a reported significant biomarker in ailments like muscular dystrophy and urothelial cancer. It also has been categorised to originate from the family of small integral membrane protein 26 transcript (Cogill &amp; Wang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">2014</xref>). Pathway annotations from KEGG, and REACTOME suggested that most of the genes involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex biogenesis, assembly, degradation, respiratory electron transport systems and Insulin like growth factors were predominantly upregulated. Phospholipid metabolism, immune reactions to pathogenesis, like response to cytokine stimulation, interleukins, neutrophils, and metal ion (copper and iron) transport components were all drastically downregulated. Captivating enrichment of neurodegenerative pathways like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and alcoholic fatty acid diseases were noted as an assert in the study. Pathways responsible for signal transduction, iron and copper metabolisms, transport of sugars, bile and organic acids were principally downregulated. The gene annotations were evident that the pathology of COVID-19 is due to high respiration rate along with the lack of glucose, ions and organic acid transportation (MacKenzie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0044">2008</xref>). COVID-19 is a multi-ailment disability that threatens the foremost physiological systems like the CNS where the chances of severe neurodegeneration is elevated over the course of infection. In consistency with the above mentioned enrichment evaluations, three distinct signalling pathways such as over-expression of miRNA biogenesis, hijack of ubiquitination by SARS-CoV-2, and angiogenesis-vasculature development were annotated. Perceived from interrelation studies, HIV arrest and its associated discovery pathways are considered to be momentous realization.</p>
33262952	        <p>To identify the abnormally expressed circRNA in HCC, we downloaded three microarray data from the GEO database: GSE78520, GSE94508, GSE97332. Then we used the GEO2R method to analyze the differentially expressed circRNAs between HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). Among these differentially expressed circRNAs, a total of 10 circRNAs were significantly upregulated in the three GSE datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). Their expression levels were illustrated using heat maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure 1A</bold></xref>). We selected the five most prominently expressed circRNAs for further verification. A comparison of 20 paired HCC and adjacent tissues showed that the expression of circGSK3B, circCSNK1G1, and circUGGT2 was significantly upregulated, but no significant differences in the transcription of circEIF3I or circTTLL5 were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figures 1D–H</bold></xref>). We detected the most significant upregulation of circGSK3B in 50 paired HCC and adjacent tissues and found that circGSK3B was remarkably highly expressed in HCC tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1I</bold></xref>). Therefore, it was chosen for further research. Next, we confirmed that the expression of circGSK3B was significantly upregulated in HCC cell lines, and the two cell lines HepG2 and SMMC-7721 were the most upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1J</bold></xref>). Therefore, we further chose these cell lines to study the role of circGSK3B in HCC and its specific regulatory mechanism.</p>

32513820	        <p>Aliquots of basement membrane construct, growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning 354230), taken from storage at −20°C, were thawed overnight at 4°C to prepare for tubuloid culture plating. All culture plates were incubated overnight at 37°C prior to plating to aid in-Matrigel attachment and polymerization. For imaging applications, a 24-well glass bottom plate (Grenier Bio-One #662892) was used to set up cultures by first plating 150 μl Matrigel to cover the surface of the plate. The bottom layer was allowed to polymerize for 1–2 h at 37°C. During the polymerization step, PKD tubuloid medium was prepared. PKD tubuloid medium was made from 37 ml of Basic tubuloid medium [490 ml DMEM/F12, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma P4333), 1% ITS (Gibco 51500-056)] filtered with a 20 μm Steriflip, 5 ml fetal bovine serum (Sigma F0926), and a growth factor cocktail of 40 ng/ml recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; Invitrogen, PHG0324), 20 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma, E9644), and 8.8 ng/ml recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF; Sigma, FO291). Mouse glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; 20 ng/ml; Sigma, SRP3200) was added to PKD tubuloid medium to make pulse medium. Following polymerization, frozen aliquots of primary tubule preparations (−80°C) were thawed and resuspended in prewarmed Basic tubuloid medium in a 15 ml conical tube coated with 2.64% BSA in 1×d-PBS. From this point forward, all plasticware, including tubes and pipette tips, was coated in 2.64% BSA solution. Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 3 min at 500 <italic><bold>g</bold></italic> and supernatant aspirated to remove residual DMSO from freezing medium. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of PKD tubuloid medium with GDNF and 100 μl of cell suspension was plated on top of the first polymerized Matrigel layer (4 wells per aliquot). Tubule preparations were allowed to attach and settle on Matrigel by incubating at 37°C for 1–2 h. Finally, another 150 μl of Matrigel basement membrane construct was added to cover the primary tubule preparations. This was the final layer of the sandwich plating technique. The top layer was allowed to polymerize and the cultures were covered with 1.5 ml PKD tubuloid medium with GDNF for 24–36 h. PKD tubuloid medium (without GDNF) was exchanged every other day by replacing 1 ml of medium each time throughout the culture period. Cultures were typically maintained for 10 days due to the longevity of Matrigel integrity.</p>

33206716	        <p>Gene expression data was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in the form of a GEO dataset using the accession number GSE44971 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0242521.ref025">25</xref>] and the R package GEOquery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0242521.ref026">26</xref>]. The rest of the data analysis was performed using a variety of R packages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0242521.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0242521.ref034">34</xref>]. Samples without a documented BRAF fusion were removed from the dataset. Two infratentorial tumors with a BRAF fusion were removed since their location was listed as “Brainstem” and “fourth ventricle” rather than “cerebellum.” Gene expression contrast was run using a linear model as implemented in the R package limma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0242521.ref035">35</xref>] for infratentorial vs. supratentorial tumors. The resulting p-value was adjusted for multiple testing via the Benjamini and Hochberg method. A P value of &lt; 0.001 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

33330453	        <p>Colonoids were isolated from Matrigel using 2 mM EDTA for 15 min and then exposed to Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) – lysis and extraction buffer (Pierce, # 89901; ThermoFisher Scientific) for protein isolation, as described in our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">McClintock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Attili et al., 2019</xref>). Proteomic experiments were carried out in the Proteomics Resource Facility (PRF) in the Department of Pathology at the University of Michigan, employing mass spectrometry-based Tandem Mass Tag (TMT, ThermoFisher Scientific). For this, three subjects were assessed separately using TMT sixplex kit for each subject. Fifty micrograms of colonoid protein from each condition was digested separately with trypsin and individual samples labeled with one of 6 isobaric mass tags following the manufacturer’s protocol. After labeling, equal amounts of peptide from each condition were mixed together. In order to achieve in-depth characterization of the proteome, the labeled peptides were fractionated using 2D-LC (basic pH reverse-phase separation followed by acidic pH reverse phase) and analyzed on a high-resolution, tribrid mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid, ThermoFisher Scientific) using conditions optimized at the PRF. MultiNotch MS3 analysis was employed to obtain accurate quantitation of the identified proteins/peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">McAlister et al., 2014</xref>). Data analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer (v2.3, ThermoFisher Scientific). MS2 spectra were searched against UniProt human protein database (20353 sequences; downloaded on 06/20/2019) using the following search parameters: MS1 and MS2 tolerance were set to 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively; carbamidomethylation of cysteines (57.02146 Da) and TMT labeling of lysine and N-termini of peptides (229.16293 Da) were considered static modifications; oxidation of methionine (15.9949 Da) and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (0.98401 Da) were considered variable. Identified proteins and peptides were filtered to retain only those that passed ≤ 2% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of detection. Quantitation was performed using high-quality MS3 spectra (Average signal-to-noise ratio of 9 and &lt;40% isolation interference). Differential protein expression between conditions, normalizing to control (0.25 mM calcium) for each subject’s specimens separately was established using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). Then, resulting data from the three data sets were combined. Proteins names were retrieved using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.uniprot.org/">Uniprot.org</ext-link>, and Reactome v70 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://reactome.org/">reactome.org</ext-link>) was used for pathway enrichment analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Jassal et al., 2020</xref>). Only Proteins with a ≤2% FDR confidence of detection were included in the analyses. STRING database - v11 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://string-db.org/">string-db.org</ext-link>) was used for additional enrichment analyses and to detect protein-protein interactions. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology (GO) and provide information related to molecular functions and biological processes. Our initial analysis was targeted toward differentiation, barrier-related, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion proteins. Follow-up analysis involved an unbiased proteome-wide screen of all proteins modified by intervention in relation to control.

32683449	        <p>In Section 2.2, we used two hypothetical scenarios to illustrate that using <italic>SR-JSD</italic> or <italic>RCC</italic> alone may fail to adequately capture the transcriptomic differences of tissue samples. In this section, we use real data to show this ineffectiveness and justify the advantages of the proposed <italic>wTSD</italic> as a higher-resolution method. For this purpose, we used the publicly available dataset in GEO GSE120795, also presented in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B33">Suntsova <italic>et al.</italic> (2019)</xref>, a comprehensive gene expression database of normal human tissues based on uniformly screened RNA-seq data. This database includes 142 tissue samples taken from 20 organs of healthy human donors of different ages, collected no later than 36 h after death. From dataset GSE120795, we selected the organ tissues that have been characterized by the HPA project, and also discarded organ tissues with less than four samples (<italic>n </italic>&lt;<italic> </italic>4) passing the quality control. The <inline-formula id="IE160"><ns1:math id="IM160"><ns1:mrow><ns1:mi>n</ns1:mi><ns1:mo>≥</ns1:mo><ns1:mn>4</ns1:mn></ns1:mrow></ns1:math></inline-formula> condition was necessary to guarantee the execution of the <italic>StARS</italic> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B18">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), which estimates the sparsity parameter of the graphical lasso algorithm (see Section 2.3) using random subsampling. The HPA includes information for only 15 out of the 20 organs in the database, and these were used in our analysis. As we can see in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>, the number of samples as well as the number of signature genes identified by the HPA project for each one of the 15 organs used vary considerably. The <italic>wTSD</italic> distance is designed to deal with this kind of situations in a principled manner.</p>
32683449	          <p>Recently published research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B20">McDonough <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) has studied the progression mechanisms of IPF, a lethal chronic lung disease which progresses the fibrosis in lungs over time, causing serious breathing difficulties. IPF affects 13–20 per 100k people worldwide. According to the National Institute of Health, about 30k–40k patients in the USA are diagnosed with IPF every year. More than 50% of IPF patients die within 3–5 years after the initial diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B14">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B16">Lederer and Martinez, 2018</xref>). The RNA-seq dataset of this study, available in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO GSE124685), consists of 84 samples classified in the following four categories: (i) Controls (<italic>n</italic> = 35), (ii) IPF Early (<italic>n</italic> = 19), (iii) IPF Moderate (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and (iv) IPF Severe (<italic>n</italic> = 15). The samples’ categorization was made based on the extent of lung fibrosis, assessed using microCT quantitative imaging and tissue histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B20">McDonough <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Using this dataset and the information of the 239 genes which, according to HPA, can be considered as the transcriptomic signature of the healthy human lung (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), we calculated the transcriptomic distances (<italic>SR-wJSD</italic>, <italic>wRCD</italic> and <italic>wTSD</italic>) of all pairs of tissue samples, one sample belonging in the Controls (reference) group and the other in the diseased groups.</p>
32683449	          <p>In a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B2">Broutier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), human primary liver cancer-derived organoids were used to recapitulate the pathophysiology of human liver tumors. From the provided RNA-seq dataset (GEO GSE84073), we extracted samples for healthy human liver tissue (Controls) and different human liver tumor subtypes, in particular: Hepato-Cellular Carcinoma (HCC), Cholangio-Carcinoma (CC) and combined HCC/CC (CHC). The number of tissue samples in each group was relatively small: (i) Controls (<italic>n</italic> = 4), (ii) HCC (<italic>n</italic> = 3), (iii) CC (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and (iv) CHC (<italic>n</italic> = 3). We also used the expression information of the 936 genes for every sample, which, according to HPA, form a transcriptomic signature of the healthy human liver (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Next, using as reference organ, the healthy human liver, we computed the corresponding pairwise distances (<italic>SR-JSD</italic>, <italic>RCD</italic> and <italic>TSD</italic>) between its samples and samples in the different cancer subtype groups. We remark here that due to the limited number of samples in the cancer groups, we decided to use the simple version (not weighted) of the <italic>TSD</italic>.</p>
32683449	        <p>In this section, we show that the proposed TSD can be used to assess the ‘physiological relevance’ of different organ models to a human organ based on RNA-seq data. Specifically, we computed the TSD of: (i) <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mouse) organs, (ii) <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> (rat) organs and (iii) human-derived organoids from the human liver and kidney used as reference organs. We obtained the RNA-seq data for the healthy human organ tissues from the publicly available database developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B33">Suntsova <italic>et al.</italic> (2019)</xref> (described in Section 3.1). The number of available samples for each healthy human organ is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. For mouse and rat, we obtained RNA-seq data from the database developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B30">Sollner <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)</xref>. For both species, the number of available samples per organ was equal to three. Finally, we retrieved RNA-seq data for healthy human liver- and kidney-derived organoids from the publicly available datasets (GSE84073 and GSE99582) presented in the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B2">Broutier <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B26">Phipson <italic>et al.</italic> (2019)</xref>, respectively. The number of samples of the healthy liver- and kidney-derived organoids were six and three, respectively. To compare the transcriptomic signatures between the different species, we associated the mouse and rat genes to human homologous genes using the R-package <italic>biomart</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="btaa654-B29">Smedley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Due to the limited number of samples (<italic>n </italic>=<italic> </italic>3) in some of the categories under comparison, we used the ‘simple’ version of <italic>TSD</italic> (not weighted).</p>

We used an adjusted (i.e., multiple-hypotheses-corrected p value of &lt; 0.0001) to identify genes that were upregulated (fetus &lt; adult) and downregulated (adult &lt; fetus) during development in each type of salivary gland. Since all adult SL tissue samples were of female background, we excluded the Y chromosome from the analyses. The remaining 40,882 genes were used for subsequent analyses. The normalized RNA abundances for 40,882 genes that we interrogated as well as comparative results are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>.

32733813	        <p>Skin macrophages and DCs, but not LCs, express the CLR Macrophage Galactose-type C-type lectin (MGL, CD301) (Raes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">2005</xref>; van Vliet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B152">2008</xref>). MGL is a homotrimeric receptor that interacts in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner with galactose and terminal GalNAc residues through the QPD motif in its CRD (Suzuki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B133">1996</xref>; Marcelo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">2014</xref>; Tanaka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136">2017</xref>). Recently, a specific lineage of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ST395) was shown to interact with MGL, as based on binding experiments with recombinant human MGL (Mnich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2019</xref>). This interaction depends on the unique WTA structure of this <italic>S. aureus</italic> lineage, which is composed of a glycerol-phosphate (GroP) backbone (as opposed to ribitol-phosphate in all other described <italic>S. aureus</italic> lineages) decorated with α-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (α-GalNAc) (Winstel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B156">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B157">2014</xref>). WTA α-GalNAc expression by wild-type <italic>S. aureus</italic> confers binding to human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and induces proinflammatory cytokine production compared to S. <italic>aureus</italic> strains genetically modified to lack α-GalNAc expression (Mnich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2019</xref>). It remains to be determined whether the observed responses correspond to the responses of primary human macrophages or DCs isolated from skin. This knowledge is highly relevant to our understanding of the skin immune detection of these <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains.</p>
32733813	      <p>In many of the studies described above, new interactions were identified using a representative bacterial strain of the species of interest and a single growth condition. Biologically-relevant interactions may be missed using such a limited set of experimental conditions. First, the bacterial target may only be expressed in a specific environment or under specific growth condition as a result of regulation. We have recently observed this for the interaction between MGL and <italic>Staphylococcus lugdunensis</italic> (Mnich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2019</xref>). The gene encoding the bacterial glycosyltransferase TagN, responsible for the incorporation of GalNAc on WTA (Winstel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B156">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B157">2014</xref>), was identified in the <italic>S. lugdunensis</italic> genome, but no MGL binding to this bacterial strain was observed (Mnich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2019</xref>). In contrast, constitutive expression of <italic>S. lugdunensis tagN</italic> from a plasmid did confer MGL binding (Mnich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2019</xref>). These results seem to indicate lack of <italic>tagN</italic> expression in <italic>S. lugdunensis</italic> under our experimental growth conditions. Second, the target may only be present in a restricted subset or lineage from that specific species. Again, we can take the example of MGL interaction with GalNAc-decorated WTA, which is exclusive for the <italic>S. aureus</italic> ST395 lineage (Mnich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2019</xref>). Overall, the glycan expression profile or repertoire on the bacterial surface after <italic>in vitro</italic> growth may not be representative for the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation. Variation between strains from a single species can be estimated based on genetic studies, but, as illustrated with the example of <italic>S. lugdunensis</italic> above, the presence of a gene does not guarantee expression under the used experimental conditions. In addition to genetic sequences, information on conditions that induce the gene or glycan biosynthesis cluster of interested can be estimated by transcriptional data from a wide range of growth conditions (Mader et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">2016</xref>).</p>
32733813	      <p>Bacteria express a specific combination of PRR ligands. Complementary, PRRs have a specific distribution pattern among different APC subsets. Consequently, engagement of the same CLR can have a different immunological outcome as a result of different co-stimulation in that particular cell type. For example, engagement of MGL by <italic>S. aureus</italic> ST395 enhances IL-6 and IL-12 production by human moDCs (Mnich et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2019</xref>), whereas engagement of MGL by <italic>C. jejuni</italic> glycosylated proteins dampens cytokine production by the same cell type (van Sorge et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B150">2009</xref>). Since it is known that MGL crosslinking does not induce cellular activation (van Vliet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B151">2013</xref>; Heger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2018</xref>), these contrasting outcomes may result from differential TLR engagement for <italic>S. aureus</italic> (activating predominantly TLR2; Takeuchi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">2000</xref>) and <italic>C. jejuni</italic> (activating predominantly TLR4; Rathinam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">2009</xref>). A similar situation of differential co-stimulation may contribute to the different outcomes of langerin targeting by <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Y. pestis</italic>. In this example, langerin-mediated <italic>S. aureus</italic> recognition induces production of Th1/Th17 cytokines, which is generally accepted to promote <italic>S. aureus</italic> clearance (van Dalen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">2019a</xref>), whereas <italic>Y. pestis</italic> exploits langerin to gain entry into LCs to facilitate dissemination to the lymph nodes (Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B164">2015</xref>). The exact molecular mechanism underlying these differential outcomes of langerin engagement by these two pathogens is currently not known. It is however intriguing to speculate that langerin targeting modulates intracellular signaling of co-triggered TLRs or possibly alters intracellular routing resulting in different antigen presentation. In the LC context, it is important to realize that these cells appear to express a restricted repertoire of TLRs compared to DCs, with consensus on absence of TLR4, TLR8, and TLR9 (Flacher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2006</xref>; van der Aar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145">2007</xref>). Consequently, LCs show no or little response to classical bacterial PAMPs such as LPS (Flacher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2006</xref>; van der Aar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145">2007</xref>).</p>

Exposure of dental pulp to environmental bacterial infection due to untreated caries, trauma, and multiple restorations would cause pulpitis and pulp necrosis, the most common types of oral diseases. Clinical management of these diseases are notoriously difficult, and patients usually end up receiving root canal treatment as the standard of care, which replaces the dental pulp with filling materials and results in a permanently devitalized tooth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Therefore, functional regeneration of dental pulp is of great interest in both translational medicine and basic research.</p><p>Over the past decade, multiple stem cells of mesenchyme origin have been identified and characterized from various tooth tissues, including stem cells from apical papilla (SCAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>), stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>), dental follicle stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>), periodontal ligament stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>), dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>), and dental papilla cells (DPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Since discovery, these cells have been extensively studied about their differentiation and regeneration capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). However, the regenerative potential of these cells for dental pulp is highly variable. For DPSCs, initial studies indicated that these cells retained typical features of mesenchymal stem cells, which could be induced to differentiate into adipose and chondrogenic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). When mixed with a hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP ceramic powder) carrier, DPSCs could be induced to form dentin-like structures with an interface layer of odontoblast-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). It was also reported that DPSCs seeded with a poly-<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactide/glycolide could form a continuous layer of regenerative dentin in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). More recently, cultured DPSC aggregates were shown to regenerate vascular-containing dental pulp in human patients, although regeneration of dentin-like structures seemed to be limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). In addition, DPCs and SHED cells were also shown to be able to regenerate pulp-like structures in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). However, as mesenchymal stem cells are famously heterogeneous, only a small fraction of single colonies from SHEDs contained dental pulp regenerative capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>), and multiple different subgroups within primary DPCs from the developing teeth were also documented in a recent study of single-cell transcriptome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Therefore, it is still unclear that dental pulp regeneration capability from tooth stem cells was from a single multipotent stem cell population or from several populations with distinct differentiation potentials.</p><p>Meanwhile, although several types of stem cells have been isolated from teeth, one often overlooked fact is that these cells were all maintained and expanded through a traditional two-dimensional (2D) adherent culture system, which is notoriously known as inadequate in supporting long-term expansion of stem cells, including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). On the other hand, 3D spheroid culture has increasingly become widely accepted as a better choice that offers a higher degree of biological and physiological relevance, which leads to the discovery and characterization of many tissue stem cells, such as mammary gland stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>), intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>), and neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). More recently, this system was further adopted to use in organoid cultures to mimic organogenesis and disease pathogenesis processes in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>). However, the use of spheroid culture in supporting self-renewal of tooth-derived stem cells was rather limited. Thus, it is important to develop a 3D spheroid culture system for tooth-derived stem cells, which may enable us to further dissect their lineage commitment and characterize subset cell groups with true tissue regenerative potentials.</p><p>In this study, we used a stem cell–supportive spheroid 3D culture system in DPCs and identified a previously undocumented multipotent population of stem cells that could form DPC spheres and maintained their self-renewal state over multiple passages. DPC spheres were positive for pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog and exhibited enhanced osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation capabilities in vitro. When transplanted in vivo, these cells could further develop to form regenerative dentin and neurovascular-like structures that mimicked the native teeth. Therefore, we name these cells as multipotent dental pulp regenerative stem cells (MDPSCs). Last, using transcriptome analysis and flow cytometry–mediated cell sorting, MDPSCs were identified as a group of CD24<sup>+</sup> cells, of which the self-renewal was highly dependent on <italic>Sp7</italic> expression, a key transcription factor (TF) in bone formation and tooth development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Last, we provided evidence that the presence of MDPSCs could also be detected in primary tissues from dental papilla in mice and human patients. Together, our data indicated that a previously unidentified group of pulpo-dentinal regenerative CD24<sup>+</sup> stem cells were present in dental papilla and expandable in 3D culture, which would have high therapeutic potential in the treatment of pulpitis and pulp necrosis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cells from mouse dental papilla could initiate sphere formation in 3D culture</title><p>To test sphere formation in DPCs, we reasoned that a stem cell supportive 3D culture system would be required. Muse cells <underline>(</underline>multilineage differentiating stress enduring cells) are a group of multipotent stem cells identified from 3D culture of bone marrow stromal cells that could be differentiated into multiple lineages in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). Although it is still highly controversial due to the lack of in vivo identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>), the isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>) and application of muse cells in animal disease models are well documented from multiple laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>). These evidences indicated that the 3D culture system used in muse cells identification might be stromal stem cell supportive, which makes it attractive to use in our primary DPC culture to test whether there are previous undocumented stem cells in dental papilla. We modified our culture method to incorporate the 3D culture system, where primary DPCs at passage 2 (DPCs P2; ~day 6) would be switched to a 3D suspension culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Unexpectedly, when primary DPCs were cultured in 3D for about 7 days, spontaneous formation of spheres could be readily noticed, which had relatively smooth surface appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and were of variable diameters ranging from 30 to 100 μm (fig. S1A). In addition, DPC spheres could be passaged over time through an adherence-suspension cycle for at least twice without proliferation loss (fig. S1, B and C). To exclude the possibility that DPC spheres were derived from cell aggregates rather than single cells, primary DPCs were first labeled with lentivirus of two different colors [mCherry and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)], respectively, before seeded in 3D culture (fig. S2A). DPC spheres seemed to develop from single starting cells (fig. S2B) and continuously grew over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Moreover, DPC spheres were positive for proliferation and pluripotency markers such as Ki67, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, as confirmed by both immunostaining and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). In comparison, only a minor fraction of primary DPCs P2 was positively stained with these pluripotency and proliferation markers (fig. S3). Together, these data suggested that a group of sphere-forming cells existed in mouse dental papilla, which were likely multipotent stem cells.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>A group of multipotent sphere-forming stem cells existed in dental papilla.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the 3D culture assay.

To mimic the dental root environment and stimulate tissue regeneration, subcutaneous transplantation of a swine-treated dentin matrix (TDM) model was chosen, as TDM was too large and hard for traditional transplantation under kidney capsule. Cells from DPC spheres, primary DPCs P2, and monolayer cultures were mixed with Matrigel and inserted into TDM before subcutaneously transplanted into immunocompromised mice for 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).

In addition, a layer of polarized cells lining along the newly formed dentin-like tissue (marked with white arrows) was similar to the odontoblasts along the pulp-dentin interface in the native teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>).

Typically, these cells could be passaged and clonally expanded over time through an adherence-suspension cycle for at least two to three cycles (2 to 3 weeks) without obvious loss of proliferation and self-renewal capacity. In addition, they exhibited enhanced osteogenic/odontogenic differentiation capabilities in vitro and in vivo and were capable of regenerating functional pulpo-dentinal complex-like tissues. We further provided evidence that CD24a was the bona fide surface marker that could be used to isolate these cells, and their self-renewal in 3D culture was highly dependent on Sp7 expression, a key TF for bone formation and tooth development. Last, these cells were also found to be present in primary dental papilla tissues from both mice and human. We therefore named these cells as MDPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>).</p><p>Although several tooth stem cell types have been identified and characterized over the past decade, regeneration of functional pulpo-dentinal complex remains a challenge. The key challenge is to rebuild vascularized pulp-like tissue accompanying with highly organized histological structure resembling the native pulp, including microvessel in the central region and dentin deposition by newly differentiated odontoblasts in the peripheral existing dentinal wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>). Several types of tooth stem cells—such as SHED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>), SCAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>), DFCs (dental follicle cells) (DFCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>), and DPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>)—have been applied in dental pulp regeneration [some even in clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>)], but the regeneration efficiency is variable, partially due to the lack of a stem cell marker that can distinguish pluripotency of tooth MSCs versus degenerated cells over long-term 2D culture. In addition, since MSCs are notoriously heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>), it is rather difficult to determine whether the observed tissue regenerative potential was from a single subpopulation of stem cells or from several different ones. In this regard, the discovery and characterization of MDPSCs not only offer an alternative cell source for highly efficient regeneration of pulpo-dentinal complex-like tissues but also provide an important piece of evidence that a single group of CD24a<sup>+</sup> cells would be able to drive the regeneration process.</p><p>CD24a, also known as the heat-stable antigen, has been previously reported as one of key stem cell markers for several normal and pathogenic cell lineages including mammary gland cells, pancreatic cancer cells, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>). During development, progenitor cells and metabolically active cells have higher CD24a expression than terminally differentiated cells, which reveals the close relationship between CD24a and cellular pluripotency and its strong correlation with self-renewal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>). In tooth stem cells, only one publication briefly mentioned that a small percentage of SCAP cells was CD24a<sup>+</sup>, and its presence was decreased upon osteodifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>). Therefore, our study provides the report that CD24a<sup>+</sup> cells may represent a unique group of dental pulp regenerative stem cells, which could be expanded through 3D culture. It is also noteworthy to point out that although CD24a<sup>+</sup> cells could be identified in primary human dental papilla, further work is warranted to investigate whether these cells can be expanded through the same 3D culture system and whether these cells also retain dental pulp regenerative potential as their counterparts in mice. In addition, as the sphere-forming efficiency of sorted mouse CD24a<sup>++</sup> cells was only ~10‰, two potential explanation could be raised: (i) The 3D culture system was not supportive enough, which requires further optimization of the medium formulation, and (ii) additional marker may be needed to further enrich the MDPSCs with high regenerative potential. Therefore, lineage tracing with CD24a would also be required to dissect the contribution of MDPSCs in tissue development and repair under physiological conditions. However, as CD24a was expressed in early mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>), a tamoxifen-inducible cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate response element (CRE) strategy would be needed to control CRE expression and label CD24a<sup>+</sup> cells specifically in dental papilla.</p><p>Together, we have identified a unique group of CD24a<sup>+</sup> stem cells in dental papilla, which exhibited enhanced osteogenic/odontogenic differentiation capabilities and could regenerate pulpo-dentinal complex-like tissues in vivo.

32380423	        <p id="p0085">Lineage tracing studies in mice have indicated that TP63<sup>+</sup> basal cells can give rise to PNECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). To determine whether human basal cells are also able to differentiate into PNECs, we performed two experiments: (1) pseudotime analysis of our human differentiation Day 91 iPNEC scRNA-seq data and (2) ALI differentiation of purified human tracheal epithelial cells (HTECs). We analyzed the scRNA-seq data of Day 91 differentiation cultures to track cell population changes across the differentiation trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A stream plot was generated using Stream and Monocle3 for easy visualization of the different cell types in our cultures projected onto the differentiation trajectory “tree” according to their pseudotime locations and the distances from their assigned branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>A). Based on the cell state during the reprograming each cell type/population is assigned to a distinct “branch” of the “tree” representing a specific cell fate choice/developmental lineage that proceeds down a distinct path. Cells on the same or nearby branches are predicted to be hierarchically related. The stream plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>A) indicates that several different cell types are present in our Day 91 differentiation cultures including basal cells, respiratory smooth muscle-like cells, fibroblast-like cells, and iPNECs. We demonstrate that the key genes expressed in the S3 – S0 branch overlap with the published human lung basal cell database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0025" ns0:href="ncbi-geo:GSE24337">GSE24337</ext-link>), confirming that iBasal cells in this culture possess a transcriptomic signature resembling that or primary human basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>B). We tracked six key PNEC marker genes, INSM1, UCHL1, NCAM1, SYP, NEUROD1, and ENO2 across the branches where a significant increase in their expression was detected as the cells transition from the iBasal cell state into the two iPNEC trajectories S0 – S1 or S0 – S2 (p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S7</xref>A–S7F). To further confirm the differentiation of iBasal cells to iPNECs, we used the reverse graph embedding tool in Moncole3 to reconstruct an unbiased lineage trajectory and assigned iBasal cells as the starting cell lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>C). Cells start at the root (State 1) and progress to one of the two alternative reprogramming outcomes, denoted by State 2 or State 3. Monocole3 trajectories support that iBasal cells differentiate into two states, State 2 and State 3, which correspond to the two different states of iPNECs, iPNEC<sup>1</sup> and iPNEC<sup>2</sup> respectively. Therefore, it is possible that the two populations observed in graph-based clustering in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A represent two different physiological states of iPNECs, as observed by Monocle3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trapnell, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trapnell et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trapnell et al., 2014b</xref>). Analysis of the differentially expressed genes between State 2 (iPNEC<sup>1</sup>) and State 3 (iPNEC<sup>2</sup>) indicates a difference in the level of the PNEC marker gene expression. UCHL1, NCAM1, and INSM1 are high in iPNEC<sup>1</sup>, whereas SYP and ENO2 are high in iPNEC<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>D). Overall, the pseudotime trajectory analysis supports an iBasal cell predating iPNECs in the differentiation protocol described in this article. Purification and expansion of iPSC-derived basal cells is currently challenging. We therefore used HTECs to corroborate our <italic>in silico</italic> finding. HTECs, consisting almost exclusively of a self-renewing population of KRT5<sup>+</sup>/TP63<sup>+</sup> basal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S8</xref>A), were cultured at the ALI and stained for SYP. After more than 75 days of differentiation at the ALI, the distribution of SYP staining in the cultures was estimated to be 17.71% ± 2.49% based on the relative MFI percentage of SYP:DAPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>E, 6F, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S8</xref>B).

After 18 h (<italic>t</italic> = 0 h), a subset of the filters were transferred to an orbital platform shaker rotating at 146 rpm (OSS) and the incubation continued.

RNA from three experiments was combined to create each sample, and three independent samples were sequenced for each time point. Library preparation was performed using the TruSEQ Stranded Total RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Following removal of ribosomal RNA, the remaining RNA was fragmented for 8 min, followed by reverse transcription. Double stranded cDNA was subjected to 3′ adenylation and ligation of sequencing adapters. Sequencing was carried out on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) to generate 75 bp paired-end reads.

32984350	        <p>ATAC-seq was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>), although with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Vrljicak et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed using cold EZ lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, Sigma-Aldrich, United Kingdom), transferred to chilled nuclease-free tubes, vortexed, left on ice for 5 min, and then pelleted in a refrigerated centrifuge. The nuclear pellet was washed in EZ lysis buffer and re-suspended in the transposase reaction mix containing 25 μl Tagment DNA (TD) Buffer, 5 μl Tagment DNA Enzyme and 20 μl nuclease free water (Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit, Illumina, United Kingdom) for 45 min at 37°C. Samples were purified using a Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Purification kit (Zymo Research, United States). Briefly, DNA binding buffer was added to 50 μl samples, mixed and transferred to the column, centrifuged at 17,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 s at RT, 200 μl DNA wash buffer added, columns centrifuged and repeated twice. After removing the residual liquid, 23 μl pre-warmed elution buffer was added and incubated for 2 min at RT, then centrifuged for 2 min to elute DNA. Twenty μl samples were added to PCR tubes containing 5 μl index 1, 5 μl index 2, 15 μl Master mix (NPM), 5 μl Primer Cocktail (Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit and Nextera Index Kit, Illumina). Amplification was performed in a Veriti 96 Well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, United States) using the following PCR conditions: 72°C for 3 min, 98°C for 30 s then 15 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 63°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min. Libraries were purified using AMPure XP beads using the Illumina Nextera kit recommended protocol and quantified using Qubit HS DNA Assay on a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Library sizes were assessed by Agilent Bioanalyzer using the High Sensitivity DNA chip. ATAC-seq library samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 to a depth of thirty million paired-end reads/sample, with a read length of 100 bp.

32533119	        <p id="Par8">A major recent advance of TIS is based on the ability to separate mutants by their physical characteristics, rather than solely on the basis of growth. The simplest forms of this have adapted classical microbiological assays to the massive multiplexing made possible by TIS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). For example, motility genes can be assayed by ‘racing’ mutant libraries across agar plates and comparing mutants in the inner population (less motile) with those in the outer population (more motile). This approach has been applied to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ST131 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>) and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PA14 (ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>), leading to the identification of known motility genes, such as those encoding common bacterial motors (flagella, fimbriae and pili), in addition to new candidates. Similarly, density–TraDISort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> combines TraDIS and density gradient centrifugation to separate mutants on the basis of their density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>) and identify genes involved in bacterial capsule production, which is a major virulence factor for many pathogens. In this study, 78 genes underlying capsule production were identified across two clinically relevant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>

33411704	        <p>Libraries were sequenced by generated 100 bp paired-end reads on HiSEq. 2000 (Illumina). Sequenced reads were quality-tested using FASTQC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1009277.ref107">107</xref>] and aligned to the hg19human genome using the STAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1009277.ref108">108</xref>] version 2.5.1b. Mapping was carried out using default parameters (up to 10 mismatches per read, and up to 9 multi-mapping locations per read). The genome index was constructed using the gene annotation supplied with the hg19 Illumina iGenomes collection and sjdbOverhang value of 100. Raw gene expression was quantified across all gene bodies, using the top-expressed isoform as proxy for gene expression, and differential gene expression was carried out using the DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1009277.ref109">109</xref>] package version 1.14 using replicates to compute within-group dispersion. Differentially bound transcripts were defined as having a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.05 and a log2 fold change &gt;1 when comparing two experimental conditions. Transcripts showing sc35-specific binding and CTCF-specific binding were defined as those significantly upregulated in the sc35 RIP or CTCF RIP compared to the control RNA-seq, respectively. Transcripts showing both significant binding of CTCF and SC-35 in HMECs but no significant binding in the vHMECs were annotated with HOMER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1009277.ref110">110</xref>] and tested for term overrepresentation using WebGestalt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1009277.ref111">111</xref>]. ChIP-seq analysis was carried out using HOMER findPeaks and mergePeaks subroutines using default parameters (four-fold enrichment over input control, four-fold enrichment over local tag count, Poisson p-value &lt; 0.001, and style factor). Peaks common to replicate 1 and replicate 2 at day 1 or day 10 were kept and merged into a common peak file. Raw read counts were then assigned to peaks using HOMER annotatePeaks using all replicates from both days. Differential CTCF peaks were found using raw counts of merged peaks from both day 1 and day 10 HMECs with DESeq2 using lenient parameters of FDR &lt; 0.05 and log2fold &gt; 1. Normalized read densities were visualized using the UCSC genome browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1009277.ref112">112</xref>]. Data was submitted to GEO (GSE139886).

33436582	        <p id="Par11">To confirm that the iCOs could show pathological phenotypes, we checked the levels of pathogenic proteins, such as beta-amyloid (Aβ)1-42, Aβ1-40, total tau, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), secreted to conditioned media. As expected, PiB<sup>+</sup> iCOs secreted higher levels of these proteins than PiB<sup>−</sup> iCOs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>, upper), and all of these levels were significantly correlated to the corresponding degree of real brain Aβ deposition, which was represented by the Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). Interestingly, among the PiB<sup>+</sup> iCOs, ApoE ɛ4 carriers secreted more pathogenic proteins, compared to ApoE ɛ4 non-carriers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>, lower). To examine this in greater depth, we generated iCOs from E3 parental (E3<sup>par</sup>) and E4 isogenic (E4<sup>iso</sup>) iPSCs, and compared them. Similar to the above-described results, E4<sup>iso</sup> iCOs exhibited higher levels of the examined pathogenic proteins, compared to E3<sup>par</sup> iCOs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>), with the exception of the total tau levels. We also tested whether our iCOs had neural activities. Our calcium oscillation assay revealed that the iCOs showed intracellular changes of calcium signaling. As previous reports found that sAD patients could have abnormal increases in intracellular calcium with neuronal hyperactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, PiB<sup>+</sup> iCOs and E4<sup>iso</sup> iCOs showed higher calcium fluorescence and more calcium peaks than PiB<sup>−</sup> iCOs and E3<sup>par</sup> iCOs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f, g</xref>). This suggested that PiB<sup>+</sup> and E4<sup>iso</sup> iCOs might have abnormal calcium regulation. Next, we performed RNA sequencing and compared their overall mRNA expression patterns. Interestingly, our principal component analysis (PCA) plot showed that there was ApoE ɛ type-dependent separation (ApoE ɛ4 non-carriers, green; ApoE ɛ4 carriers, yellow) in the mRNA expression pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h</xref>). An exception was the PiB<sup>+</sup> #3 iCO, which was an ApoE ɛ4 non-carrier but carried a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant (A288T, G &gt; A) in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a, b</xref>). It held an ApoE ɛ type-independent position, but remained well separated from the PiB<sup>−</sup> iCOs. Consistent with a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, PiB<sup>+</sup> and E4<sup>iso</sup> iCOs showed numerous down-regulated DEGs related to synaptic functions and neurogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i</xref>). Furthermore, our transcriptome data was further verified by comparing with public transcriptome data from the GEO database (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). We found a public iPSC-derived neuron data (PIN) for AD (Accession number: GSE143951, Platform number: GPL16043) and a human AD brain data (PHB) (Accession number: GSE109887, Platform number: GPL10904) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a, b</xref>). Interestingly, our own transcriptome data had dramatically high GO similar to PHB (CC, 64.9% for PiB iCOs and 76.5% for E4 iCOs; BP, 58.7% for PiB iCOs and 26.0% for E4 iCOs; MF, 46.7% for PiB iCOs and 29.4% for E4 iCOs), whereas PIN had low GO similar to PHB (CC, 7.0% for PIN; BP, 4.2% for PIN; MF, 8.3% for PIN) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4c</xref>). In addition, most of the GO terms in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i</xref> were also included in PHB (21/28, 75%) as significant terms, but were not included in PIN (6/28, 21%) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4d</xref>). Together, our results confirm that our iCOs had pathological features of AD, and thus could be an appropriate model reflecting characteristics of the actual disease-related human brain lesions.</p>

Following cell capture and lysis, cDNA was synthesized and amplified according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10X Genomics). The resulting libraries were sequenced on the Nova-seq platform. The Cell Ranger (v.2.0.2) software pipeline was used to create FASTQ files which were aligned to the hg19 genome using default parameters.

33529199	        <p>First, resources for the rabbit genome were compiled. We concatenated FASTA files for each rabbit chromosome, mitochondrial DNA, and unplaced scaffolds from OryCun2.0 (Assembly GCA_000003625.1) to create a reference genome FASTA file. The Ensembl annotation (May 2019) was used. Sequencing reads and genome resources were uploaded to the Galaxy web platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1009290.ref089">89</xref>], and the public server <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://usegalaxy.org">usegalaxy.org</ext-link> was used to process and map reads. First, reads were trimmed using Trim Galore! (Galaxy Tool version 0.4.3.1) with automatic adapter sequence detection. Then, trimmed reads were mapped to the rabbit reference genome and annotation using RNA STAR (Galaxy Tool version 2.6.0b-1). featureCounts (Galaxy Tool version 1.6.4+galaxy1) was used to build a count matrix from mapped reads using the Ensembl annotation as a guide. Count matrices were exported from Galaxy and imported into R (version 3.5.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1009290.ref090">90</xref>]. The read counts for each gene were normalized to Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) to compare expression of marker genes across samples. TPM was calculated by first dividing the number of read counts by the length of the gene in kilobases to yield reads per kilobase (RPK). Gene RPKs were summed for each sample and this number was divided by 1,000,000 to yield a sample-specific scaling factor. The RPK value for each gene was divided by the scaling factor to yield TPM. Marker gene transcript abundance was compared using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test. The Bejmamini-Hochberg Procedure was used to control for the false discovery rate with multiple comparisons at 5%. The non-normalized count matrix was also analyzed using DESeq2 (version 1.22.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1009290.ref091">91</xref>] to compare the abundance of transcripts between different inoculum types to identify differentially expressed genes. Parametric dispersion was used and shrinkage of effect size was performed using the package apeglm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1009290.ref092">92</xref>]. Genes with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed. Normalized read counts were generated using a regularized log (rlog) transformation and used to perform principal component analysis (PCA) of each sample. Raw reads and count matrices have been deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (GSE156056).</p>

To compare the morphological change in SARS-CoV-2-infected ApoE3 and ApoE4 astrocytes, we measured the astrocyte soma size.

33450186	        <p id="p0095">Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daniloski et al. (2020)</xref> screened host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection by genome-wide CRISPR knockout and identified about 40 genes that are involved in different steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including receptor binding, endosomal entry, spike cleavage and membrane fusion, endosomal recycling, spike protein cleavage, viral RNA transcription and translation, and ER-Golgi trafficking. To explore mechanisms underlying the differential susceptibility of ApoE3 and ApoE4 cells to SARS-CoV-2, we compared the expression level of these host factors in isogenic ApoE3 and ApoE4 astrocytes by gene-expression profiling. Among the host genes examined, <italic>ACTR2</italic> (endosomal entry), <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> (spike protein cleavage, endosomal acidification and processing), <italic>ERMP1</italic> (ER), and <italic>CHST14</italic> (Golgi) showed higher expression levels in ApoE4 astrocytes than that in ApoE3 astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>E and 3F). Of the differentially expressed host factors, ACTR2 is an actin cytoskeleton-associated protein that is involved in endosomal entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daniloski et al., 2020</xref>), while ATP6AP2 is a subunit of the vacuolar-ATPase proton pump important for endosomal acidification and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee and Kane, 2020</xref>).

33563833	      <p>The meteoric rise of multidrug resistance threatens a return to preantibiotic days by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Drug-resistant bacteria such as the pandemic <underline>e</underline>xtraintestinal <underline>p</underline>athogenic <named-content content-type="genus-species"><underline>E</underline>scherichia coli</named-content> (ExPEC) sequence type 131 (ST131) are associated with systemic infections of the urinary tract, brain, peritoneum, peripheral organs, blood, and indwelling devices, resulting in 9 million infections per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). These strains readily colonize the human intestine, which can become a reservoir, prior to extraintestinal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p>
33563833	        <p>Previous studies reported that phage HP3, a lytic myovirus isolated from environmental reservoirs of ExPEC, reduces ST131 bacteremia and disease severity in murine models of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Since the human gastrointestinal tract is the primary reservoir of ExPEC ST131, we wondered if phage HP3 could act prophylactically to reduce or eliminate ExPEC burden in the intestine. To test this, mice were orally gavaged with an ExPEC ST131 clinical isolate JJ1901, previously used in the mouse model of bacteremia study described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and then treated with phage or an antibiotic as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>. Untreated mice sustained stable bacterial colonization during the course of the experiment (6 days) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). When phage HP3 was given to animals via water or a daily gavage, the levels of ExPEC were indistinguishable from that of the untreated control at the end of the experiment. An uptick in CFU was noted on day 2; however, all groups leveled out by day 3 until the end of the experiment. No ExPEC was detected at any time point in the antibiotic-treated group. Interestingly, phage HP3 was detected and active as determined via plaque assay by plating the stool of phage-treated mice on an overlay of ExPEC bacteria, even on day 4, indicating that the lack of ExPEC reduction was not due to a lack of delivery to the intestinal environment or to inactivation of the phage (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref> in the supplemental material). It should also be noted that despite having higher levels of phage upon gavage during days 1 to 4, the phage was no more effective at removing ExPEC than phage given in the water, suggesting that in this experiment, there was no dose-dependent effect of phage. In addition, as many as 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/g phage were found in the murine intestinal tissue (including cecum and colon) on day 6, the final day of the study, yet there was little to no clearing of ExPEC compared to that in these tissues of the untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>). Importantly, antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and diversity, as determined by the Shannon diversity index, which takes into account species richness and distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">C</xref>) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009). Also, a principal-component analysis (PCA) of beta diversity demonstrated that mice in the antibiotic cohort clustered together and away from the untreated and phage groups, suggesting antibiotics had a more profound effect on the microbiome than phage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1D</xref>). Finally, we assessed phage killing in a modified “cecal medium” (CM) that is derived from the cecal contents from recently euthanized mice. These cecal contents were pooled and homogenized in sterile saline solution and then centrifuged to remove large particulates. This medium is designed to simulate the luminal complexity of the mammalian intestine, since it contains fecal matter, a microbiome, mucus, and likely many of the small molecules and proteins present in an intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1E</xref>). Whereas phage HP3 completely abolished ExPEC in LB (nearly a 9-log drop in levels and no detectable live bacteria) and nearly abolished it in a slurry of fecal pellets taken from the same murine host (∼8-log drop in levels), there was little to no phage-based killing in CM, despite recovering nearly 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7.5</sup> PFU/ml of phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">F</xref>). These results mirrored those from the ExPEC colonization model and indicate there is a factor(s) present in the mammalian GI that inhibits this lytic phage.</p>

ES17’s putative tail fiber protein (ES17-TFP) showed high similarity, based on a BLAST analysis (64% similar; E value, 0), to a tail fiber protein in another lytic podophage, the T7-like bacteriophage LM33_P1 (<ext-link assigning-authority="ncbi:protein" ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/YP_009324518.1">YP_009324518.1</ext-link>), which also targets ST131 strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4A</xref>). T7-like phage tail fibers have been shown to possess endosialidases that target surface sugars, such as capsule-forming polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). A BLAST analysis revealed that ES17-TFP contains a putative pectinesterase (E value, 7.45e−03; 369 bp). This domain was only found in four other phages, myPSH1131, myPSH2311, vB_EcoS_Golestand, and LM33_P1, and of those, only myPSH1131 has it in the same tail fiber protein as ES17 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4B</xref>).</p>
33563833	      <p>A limitation of all antibiotics is their broad killing activity and no inherent features to function well in complex human environments, including human blood, urine, or at mucosal surfaces throughout the body. In particular, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a highly complex system made up of diverse organs and tissues and, within that, a diversity of cell types. Some of the cells and factors found at the mucosal surface may influence intestinal capacity, including intestinal epithelial cells, enteroendocrine cells, stem cells, mucus-secreting goblet cells, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; from Paneth cells), and secretory immunoglobulin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">–</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). To add to this complexity, the GIT is colonized by a large number of microbes, including archaea, fungi, protists, and bacteria that have coevolved with the host, termed the human gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). A bacteriophage would have to navigate through this complex ecosystem to find and infect its host. Since there are estimated to be &gt;10<sup>10</sup> PFU/g of phages already present in the GIT, this suggests that phages can thrive in this environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Here, we report a novel antibacterial targeting strategy that seems to have evolved to position a lytic bacteriophage in the exact niche as its bacterial host. Our results indicate that (i) phage HP3 that is lytic toward <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ST131 <italic>in vitro</italic> and is very effective at eliminating bacteremia in a murine model of sepsis is ineffective when tested for this same property in the murine intestinal tract, (ii) the inhibition is due to intestinal mucins, (iii) a medium designed to mimic the luminal environment can be used to identify phage with enhanced lytic activity in such an environment, and (iv) a podovirus phage, isolated from human wastewater, overcomes this inhibitory activity due to an enhanced ability of the phage to bind to heparan sulfated proteoglycans present in mucus or immobilized on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, which likely drives the positional targeting of the phage to the exact ecological niche as the host bacterium. In addition, our data reveal that this treatment, compared to antibiotic treatment, did not alter the intestinal diversity of the microbiota. Taken together, these data suggest a new mechanism of predation by a phage, one which may be highly useful for the killing of bacteria in intestinal environments.</p>

This localized well-characterized cell types, such as ISCs at the crypt bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>Ai and 2Aii), <italic>FOXF2</italic>- muscularis cells in the outer muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>Aiii), and BEST4/OTOP2 cells toward the crypt top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>Aiv). Transcriptomic signatures from adult cell populations, such as crypt top colonocytes and myofibroblasts, also localized to appropriate anatomical locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>B). Furthermore, individual gene expression aligned with morphology; <italic>RET</italic> showed spot-specific expression at myenteric plexuses and <italic>PTPRC</italic> (CD45) at submucosal lymphoid follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>B).<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Spatio-temporal analysis of intestinal development with ST and scRNA-seq integration</p><p>(A) UMAP plot of spot transcriptome clusters from each slide shown on left; clusters are visualized on tissue covered slide areas (left center).

Vertical break indicates muscularis mucosa/distance score of zero and spots in the submucosa are assigned a negative distance score while spots in the mucosa are assigned a positive distance score. Two broad gene clusters are assigned by cutting hierarchical clustering tree, dividing the gene groups into mucosa and sub-mucosa specific expression groups. Selected GO BP terms enriched in each cluster are shown.
